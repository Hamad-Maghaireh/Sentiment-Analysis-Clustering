146157,The kettle looks great but after just 4 times using it it started leaking around the on switch and smoke was coming out so I can’t use it anymore
106708,"Easy to order, very quick dispatch...Excellent service."
141727,could not use debit card for payment it kept telling me the payment was not completed and yet there was nothing else to fill in on screen
187375,"Christ on a bike. How are these people still in business? The old laptop was sent away and ended up being scrapped and we weren't informed. They then tried to tell us that they had attempted to contact us about it, which was a lie as no calls, messages or emails had been received or left
We were then told we would be getting a code for a new laptop equal to the value of the old one and that it would take up to three days, which is part of our plan. This was also a lie. It is now one week later and have finally managed to get through on the phone after a cumulative 3-4 hours spent on hold (clearly I have nothing better to do with my time) to have to cancel the call due to their phone reception being so bad it cut out repeatedly. I need a gin."
124039,"Excellent service, so simple to order the new compatible Dyson cleaner DC24 brushroll. Dispatched next day and we were kept fully informed by email. The part fitted perfectly, could not have asked for anything better. Congratulations eSpares on your superb service."
166363,"On 7th December I visited their Dundee store with the intention of purchasing a Samsung A53 5G. I had seen them on their website and they were being offered with a £100 cashback, which made them the lowest price seller of the product. Unfortunately, they were out of stock at Dundee so I told the sales assistant I would place the order online. He gave me the link address to claim the cashback, which I would have 60 days to claim.

When I returned home, I immediately placed the order - order number CUR2230043714. The product was delivered the following day. I remembered about the cashback last week and decided to progress my claim. I entered the link address the sales assistant in the Dundee store had given me but unfortunately he had misspelt it. I went back to the site to see if it was still available but unfortunately it had been removed. I was unable to get through to them by telephone, so I used their webchat service.

Initially I was told that there was no such offer. Fortunately I visited the store with 2 others, so I have witnesses that it certainly did exist. I insisted that the offer DID exist and the operator at the other end became a little more cooperative. I was put on hold......on hold.....on hold and so on and so on until eventually I was told the ""Concern Team"" would get back to me in 24 to 72 hours. I clicked to have a transcript of the conversation emailed to me at the end of the chat but I still haven't received anything which makes me a little suspicious. The offer clearly did exist as their assistant gave me the link address, albeit incorrectly.

I have spent well over £4000 with them over the past 12 months. I am not impressed and would welcome an explanation.

UPDATE

Following the response from ""Jim"" I tried to call both of the numbers. The first one was answered but neither myself or the person on the other end could understand each other. I attempted to speak to someone on 4 occasions but got nowhere. I tried the other number, but every time I selected the desired option, I got cut off. Clearly this ""cashback"" offer was never meant to be. Be warned!!"
162533,Stay away from this company. They do not do what they say and do not answer your e-mails and have no way to make a complaint or call them. I sent a phone to get a glass screen repaired the website said it would be done in 24 to 48 hour. They have had the phone 11 days all the notes say is that they are waiting for a technician. Are they stealing my phone? Who knows they wont communicate. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.
126437,"It used to be good, with good roaming plans. Then became useless, the phone stops working after a short time you are in an overseas country, Eu included, and I have just been charged 36£ to get on my WhatsApp while in Indian airport, 15mb for 36£, a robbery!! Changing provider as soon as I land in UK!"
108460,All the photos came out much darker than they actually were. Very disappointing.
154264,"Excellent service delivered exactly when l was told, excellent communication on all fronts and delivery drivers were very efficient and polite. Have used them before and when l upgrade my kitchen l will use them again. Wouldn’t go anywhere else!"
109552,"It’s been a month since I joined Bt and two weeks since my last review and I can confirm that BT is totally useless and still haven’t fixed my service! The number of calls and hours I’ve spent talking to them I should be charging them by the hour!

Hopefully I will get my original number back and I can move back to a more reliable company.

Once again Id advise anyone reading this review, don’t join BT !!!"
125552,The Christmas duvet cover had missing buttons.
163613,"What a great choice from a great team upgrade was so easy they listened to what I wanted and gave me more
And unlike other companies delivered what they offered"
181314,Great customer service. The first TV arrived damaged which is really annoying but I accept sometimes things like this happen. But I had a positive experience dealing with it - we got a replacement TV sent out the next day
137444,"The worst provider you can ever use! After months of trying to sort the issue with my account and wasted hours on the phone with them nothing has been resolved! Customers service is awful! Every time you can expected to hear that they will get it sorted or escalated. Empty promises. Even charging more than should, promising refunds or credit on account, but never doing it! The shop staff is not trained properly, they have no knowledge and they never can help. ""Technical"" team is laughable. Never able to resolve issue. Advice to anyone looking for new contract, NOT VODAFONE ! After 6 months of not being able to resolve an issue and prove service I signed up for, they won't even void the contract! Ridiculous. Next step for me will be Ombudsman!"
118572,"First class service. I was able to set up the trade-in process through the MM website without any problems. The mailing service was swift, the product was received next-day as advertised and the payment was made by 17:00 that same day.
I also had to call the customer service department and the lady on the phone was very pleasant and understood my concerns. I was also not kept waiting on the phone for long - it was easy to get in touch for support"
171317,"After suffering terribly with my old supplier, I moved to BT. To date the service, has been perfect. The install was done as promised at short notice, the line has been good and even the billing is as agreed. Previous supplier failed on all of these, and then made it difficult to correct. If you are struggling where you are and thinking of shifting to BT I can highly recommend them. I only wish I had done it six months ago with the problems started with my old supplier."
144818,"Very efficient. On time.
Would recommend."
174082,Helpful telephone assistant as finding the correct spare part can be difficult
161319,I’d recommend delivered on time look nice
171564,"I've now ordered 2 PCs from PCSpecialist, both of them were Next Day PCs (Pre-built) due to my lack of knowledge of anything complex about PC specifications, I am very impressed with the build quality, price and delivery time. If you're like me who doesn't know much about PC specifications then I would recommend PCSpecialist. Will definitely order again in the future when I need an upgrade."
123746,I had a few fails with the product form cex... But nah... What can you expect.... They are second hand!!!!
117633,Friendly and efficient support with my ongoing query from Melisa T. Many thanks for your help!
162981,Aron and Darrel were friendly and delivered my new tumble dryer swiftly with no issues. Thank you!
153205,"Ordering simple, delivery extremely quick, communication spot on, goods (TV) brilliant - overall an excellent experience"
100848,"Returning a completely unused phone - not even taken out of the DPD bag it arrived in. (Due to mix-up we had ordered two).
20 days after DPD confirmed that CPW had received the phone, still no refund.
So, waste some time on their customer support. Apparently a ""cheque"" (remember those??) was issued 7 days after my return was received, and that it may take 28 days to arrive. Obviously using the Victorian postal service.
Come on CPW - join the 21st Century!"
176997,"Great delivery service.

Thanks"
128714,"Have always used Mazuma to sell old phones and so I did again. As always, it's easy and things just work"
103127,"The worst company to buy anything from.

had my phone stolen before it was delivered, took over 11 weeks to get my refund and over 13 phone calls.

Customer service is a nightmare, they literally shout at you over the phone and when you complaint they don't do anything to fix it.

an absolute scam of a company, better go buy directly from windows or apple"
188355,Bought a Breville toaster. Tripped the fuseboard at home from the word go. Took 6 emails before I got a response then they contacted me asking for photos of toaster and weather I'd changed the fuse and checked the socket. Finally I rang instead and got sorted in minutes. What a waste of time the online service is. Just ring or go into store.
154740,Quality of the poster and speed of delivery
102426,"The whole process from ordering my custom build to the delivery was quicker than I’d expected. My stunning PC had been packaged so well and was in immaculate condition. The specs work amazingly well and I can now play my games without lag for the first time in years. The specs I have now are top of the line and cost a fraction of what big brands would charge you for a pre-built PC. Their care and skill for their craft can be seen in the perfect condition the PC arrived in, as well as the testing process which all of their products undergo to make sure they work. I was update via email when my PC entered a new phase of the process so that I could have peace of mind and feel confident that I had chosen a great company who would ensure my build was perfect. 11/10 would recommend PC Specialists to anyone aspiring to customise their own PC or laptop."
113068,"I bought a google pixel 7 on a vodafone deal. Multiple issues with the credit check which I understand was not the fault of mobile phones direct. But very little contact was provided in order to rectify the administration error. I rang 3 times in order to fix the problem. I was told the mobile was in stock and the check would be re-ran in. 24-48 hours. 48 hours later the phone is out of stock.

Edit -11/11/22 I contacted the company again - and despite despite the website stating that the phone is available online for next day delivery. The phone is actually out of stock for 4-7 days. Now I am going away for 2 weeks with no access to a mobile phone. I've wasted 2 hours on the phone to try and sort this before having to finally cancel the mobile.

THANKS MOBILES PHONES DIRECT FOR A TRULY TERRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE!"
138430,Excellent service very helpful and explained every aspect
193670,I was so worried about ringing she'll and asking them for help but the gentlemen Richard was so helpful and understanding after having a bad couple of months and having two poorly baby's in last few weeks he couldn't of been as more helpful I'm truly thankful the help and support so nice that some people out there understand.thank you again I truly am
111032,"My internet service was down for 17 days continuously between June-July 2022. I was told an auto-compensation would be calculated by the system and a credit applied to my account. This did not happen to date. Yesterday I spent 1.5 hours on the phone being passed between 6 departments all asking the same security questions with no answer for my query, they didn’t even understand my query and just blamed another department. In between this the call was dropped twice with me having to ring back. This is the most awful customer service I’ve ever faced and I’ll definitely be leaving to get my broadband from another provider with better customer service."
170965,"We have used Hughes many time in the past so when we needed a new tumble dryer I only got in touch with them.
The range of products was good and the item was delivered to the Ipswich shop the day after for collection.

When I went to collect it I was asked for my email collection note I informed them that I had not had an email and the reply was we always send them out so you must have! I double checked and no email had been received, three time they said I must have, which started to grate a little.
Another person took over and found it on the system I showed some identification and it was sorted

The 1st person had an attitude and never apologised or even smiled once even though I saw on there system they had entered the address incorrectly
This experience has really made me question whether I will use Hughes anymore certainly not the Ipswich branch
What has happened to good old fashioned customer service ☹️"
163934,"Great condition, couldn’t be happier with this phone iPhone 11pro.

Great price too"
123505,"Shocking service waiting months for repair to washer dryer which has never worked properly. Fobbed off to a sub contracted company who turned up (week later than agreed) and said another 2 weeks for a part even through fault was clearly explained. Phoned up promised call back which never materialised then phoned and hung up on, then told systems were down next time i called. Beyond a joke. Avoid like the plague they are total cowboys."
101796,"Simply dishonest.
Online chat for more than an hour. I simply wanted to check my roaming status. Turns out they changed my plan without asking me.
I was assured I was a ‘valued, long time customer’ and I’d be offered a great new deal on a sim plan. Whilst waiting I was checking what they offered on the website. The advisor then offers me a worse deal than I could get directly on their website. When I questioned it I got the reply ’just let me check the options for you sir’. Suddenly, surprise surprise, a better offer comes from thin air.
Three UK are completely dishonest. Be really careful and do your homework before you pay their made up price.
No wonder their rating is shocking. I’m moving all my family (5 accounts) elsewhere."
138773,"The worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with. A very expensive and soul-destroying experience.
They literally couldn't care less about their customers. You cannot speak to the same person twice so no matter how much you are over-charged or how bad the service you have no recourse to complain and just have to pay or be cut-off.
I feel like I've been stolen from. Do not even deserve one star."
165465,"The whole experience with deliveroo is quite disappointing. The top of the iceberg is that I receive a pizza with a piece of plastic and they didn’t do anything about it.
They wanted a picture of my chewed pizza with the plastic in it. Disgusting. I’ll cancel the all and use Uber eat from now. Wake up customer service!"
183097,"Really good customer service, had a query about a delivery date and Kate was efficient and reassuring about getting my graphics card delivered correctly"
153910,First class company did everything in a good manner
134099,The customer support is the worst thing i have experienced. I dont know how many hours i have spent in total just to make sure that the open reach engineer will come for the Fiber installation. I am desperate...
199350,"Easy to Order . Item as described on delivery
No issues"
133166,Brilliant service great phone and super quick delivery thank you !
119066,Very simple site to navigate and order. Deliveries are prompt.
163502,"I can fully understand how this lot and Currys work together....both are totally useless and incompetent to the highest level...our TV had a manufacturing fault and still under warranty. It was sent for repair and came back 'fully repaired'....it wasn't of course. The manufacturer arranged a home repair...to no avail and it turned out it was a manufacturing fault which is what was already known. Team Know Nothing then agreed to honour the uplift number and replace the TV.....they then turned around and told us they couldn't replace it as it was no longer available. They agreed to refund the money and then it goes even more pear shaped when Team Know Nothing then email me, with no reference number, from an email address that cannot be replied to and tell me again that they have no ability to replace the TV.....this is despite being told already ONE WEEK EARLIER that they were going to refund the money. In the interim, we have had email after email telling us different things from what we have already been told and now, they expect us to wait ANOTHER 10 days for our refund.....THIS LOT ARE A BLOODY JOKE.....I wouldn't trust them to operate a light switch.....a few words to describe Team Know Nothing.....Morons, imbeciles, incompetent, negligent, ...I don't need to go on, do I? Oh! And get this.....we got the same model TV (newer updated model) from another supplier...so, how this lot can't get them is beyond me"
111475,"Great customer service from G Tec
Ordered a dyson hover
It never turned up even after several complaints
So ordered a new Gtec battery for my old hover and was delivered the next day
Wonderful !!"

Items as described and delivered the following day at a fair price.
A good experience."
114564,Found what I was looking for at a reasonable price. Good were delivery exactly when I expected
126790,"Kept taking money from my account after I cancelled my service.
Won't refund my money.
Customer service is the worst I've ever come across
Please stay clear, spend your money elsewhere, even if they are cheap it's not worth it."
136509,"Awful from start to finish , changed to talk talk as it was the cheapest and fastest available , kept om getting texts saying there was a issue , spoke to numerous advisors all told me everything was okay and the order is on track , website never said anything about the order just saying error , spoke to advisors and they kept on cutting me off !!!! then had a text saying order has been cancelled"
108914,Not enough staff to deal with public as our Argos on Wheatley hall road has closed
164874,"Only thing is that theirs not much communication,and your left wondering if your payment is going to be accepted or not and you have to wait for the company to accept or decline the hire of the cars."
146057,Terrible App. Trying to watch the Cricket T20 World Cup Final at the moment. Buffering and freezing all the time. I have to keep exiting and going back into the App for it to start streaming again. Losing all enjoyment of watching the game. It's not the Wifi connection as i've tried watching Youtube and the streaming is fine.
190268,"Offered the best price for my iPhone 12.
Great communications from start to finish and payment received the same day.
Will definitely use again."
181503,"I am extremely disappointed with my purchasing experience. In several ways, Currys has not responded well and has left me in a very unhappy position. I visited my local store to look at a laptop. I was told that they did not have the one I wanted in stock and I should purchase online and get it delivered, next day, to the store. This delivery would be free.

I made my purchase online and checked the next day delivery button. This forced me to accept a £5 charge. The laptop arrived 3 days later in store. When I discussed this with the advisor, he was gruff, unhelpful and fobbed me off saying I had to call a premium rate number to discuss with someone else. He could not and would not help me.

I will not be buying from Currys again. Very poor customer service is unnecessary."
139002,"After ordering, I was emailed the day before delivery to notify me that my order would arrive the next day as planned, then I would be notified the next day with an actual time of delivery, which I was, so full marks for being kept fully informed throughout the whole process!"
120422,"It’s bad and extra charging company not recommended at all I finish my contact and also send them back device I have reply from them they received device but still they are sending me bills
They charge extra money if you set up direct debt kindly have a look your account they are robbers don’t use BT
Use other networks they are good customer service and provide good service as well
Bad service and over charging
Not recommend at all plz plz plz don’t use BT network"
177943,"Worst experience I have ever encountered.

Last Monday, was promised on the phone that a replacement voucher for my laptop that they couldn’t fix would be with me in 72 hours. I phoned 72 hours later. Was told on the phone it would be with me at the end of the day.

It was not.

I went to my local branch to complain. The manager told me that the phone operators should not have told me three days. He told me it would likely be with me at the weekend. It is now Wednesday. That was a lie.

I told my clients I would be able to complete work for them last Thursday. Now, I am unable to meet my commitments (because TeamKnowHow) did not meet theirs, and I am losing hundreds of pounds a week. I am being threatened by my clients and having refunds requested due to non completion of work, thus losing more money.

I have spoken to various operators and had various direct message conversations on Twitter. I am being fed the same rubbish.

I have paid good money to this firm, and in return they have cost me hundreds of pounds and damaged my working relationships.

I hope that their complaints resolution is sufficient enough to retain my custom, which is hanging by a thread. I am appalled that I and others would be treated in this way."
194730,"Delivery drivers on push bike are dangerous ( even to them self,no lights no high viz equipment wear) bringing always cold food.
This service needs definitely improvement!!!"
120518,I ordered 2 of the same calendar. Easy to choose your own pictures. Easy to complete order.

143624,Arrived really quickly after I ordered and I am very happy with the quality of the paper
148792,Ordered 22nd December for delivery on the 23rd! Easy to order. Quick delivery. Arrived within allocated time slots. Playstation and game bundle arrived in 2 separate deliveries on the same day
173298,"TO DESCRIBE THEIR SERVICE AS 'RUBBISH', FLATTERS THEM. Ordered on 30/11, received on 01/12, returned both the SIM and handset the same day. Due to postal strike they received the item on 05/12, but they couldn't be bothered to list the item as received on their systems until 13/12.

ONLINE ACCOUNT SHOWED 'Awaiting Return' until about 30 minutes ago. It has now changed to 'Return Received'. THE CHEEK OF IT, AFTER 24 DAYS.

I have called the SIX TIMES, to be told they are sorry it will be processed shortly. NADDA.

Twice guaranteed that it would be processed the next day. NADDA.

Told on multiple occasions that once they process the return then the network would be advised to cancel the contract and any payment collected would be refunded. NOW told that I would have to pay for days it was connected on network. SINCE THE DELAY IS ON THEIR PART, why the hell should I pay?

Anyway, i returned an unused product and I did not use the service AT ALL within the statutory limit for Distance Selling (finance product, monthly payment), I am not required by law to pay a penny where I have not benefited from the service.

AFTER SIX CALLS, still no progress. No idea when the contract will be disconnected, no idea when I will get my upfront cost back, no idea how many phone calls and emails it will take to ensure that I am not charged for unused service.

TOTALLY AND UTTERLY USELESS.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS, IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY."
153589,Took best part of 3 weeks to dispatch from order which is not great. However on the occasions i called for information advice and when I ordered the descktop staff was well knowledge and very helpful.

119746,The delivery was far too long nearly ten days. They quoted 5-7. If they do not have products in stock they should not be advertising for sale
177752,"I researched the product I needed Online, including reading customer reviews.
I eventually ordered my choice for collection from the Christchurch Dorset branch of Currys and waited for the e-mail telling me that it was ready for collection.

( when clearly I said that is the day I have to leave the country to go see my family abroad). I said I want a refund instead and they won’t help. Shocking service. I will never order again and seeing similar reviews I suggest everyone not to either. I’m so annoyed coz I don’t even have money to order another from somewhere else they really fu€¥Ed it up for me!
169521,"My internet has been down for 3 weeks, a technician came out to fix the fault but sadly was not too sure what the problem was, perhaps its the cable under the street.

I have not been able to speak to anyone through the customer service number. My internet is still not working and no communication has been made as to what the next steps are.

I continue to pay for a service that doesn’t work."
136574,"If I could give Zero stars i would!!!!

Bought a MacBook pro in 2014 and took out the anything happens cover and renewed it every time it was up for renewal as Apple products are expensive and it seemed a very cost effective way of having it replaced or fixed.

I've never had to use it up until February this year. Luckily it was within the final month of the anything happens policy I had.
I had an issue with the MacBook randomly turning off and not coming back on until I tried again a few hours later.
I sent this in to Curry's PC World and they sent it off to Team KnowHow.
I was without my MacBook for a week and I struggled to get by as I needed it for work.
A week later my MacBook returned into store and it worked for a week and the same issue was happening again.
After calling technical support at Team dontknowhow they asked me to press few buttons to reset the hardware... this wiped the whole operating system.
I sent this back to the store and stressed to them that I needed my MacBook and they left me without it for a week already and that this is an inconvenience to myself taking it again for something that wasn't rectified.
They couldn't say much as it was Team Knowhows issue.
A week went by where i couldn't get by without my MacBook and I received a text message stating that it had only been picked up to go in for repair.
I was astonished as to how this had happened and it meant I was another week without out on top of the week previous. No one would own up to how it wasn't picked up.
I phoned both the store and Team knowhow who weren't very empathetic and couldn't see the issue I had without my MacBook.
This came back to me and it was fine for a month or 2 and the problem started again. I have this on video and they didn't want to see it.
My MacBook was out of the Anything happens policy and still not fixed. They put it under there 90days repair and it went in again and I was without My MacBook for the 3rd time. I've been working from home and i'm self employed so i needed this more than ever. They didn't care.
It came back again and it was fine for just over a month and it happened again this time not coming on at all.
This is the fourth time it's been in for not turning on. My anything happens policy is supposed to write these devices off and replace them.
I have mentioned this to them and they said my policy has expired even though the original problem of turning off and turning not back on is still happening.

I tried to go through their complaints department and there is no reply after 5 days. Obviously they are not bothered and ripped me off over the past six years.
The anything happens policy is not worth the paper it is written on and I wouldn't recommend or buy it again. I wouldn't buy from Currys PC World again either.

192608,NICE PHONE RECIEVED ON TIME BUT 3 DAYS LATE SO ALITTLE UNHAPPY WITH THAT
154452,I was aware of that I am getting a confirmation email when my item can be collected from the store and this will happen in 48 hrs. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. No confirmation email and when gave them a call after 48 hrs they couldn't tell me whether the item was available or not. Nothing happened after 3 working days. And I rang them again after 5 working days and they still couldn't tell whether my item was available to pick up in store or not. So I popped in to store and the employee told me that the item was available to pick up for a few days and that I should've received an email or call or voicemail. I did not receive any such messages. Then because I was angry as I was very very unsatisfied I told their employee to hurry up because I don't have all day. He said I can come back even when he did see that I am pregnant and I cannot come back because I'm in the finish. Also the advertisement says I could've claimed for a free speaker with Huawei phone but I didn't receive any. The employee said my order doesn't show the free speaker so I don't get one. I felt very uncomfortable. And very said. Thanks carphone warehouse!
136811,"Domestic and general has refused to replace my broken fridge freezer. They hung up on me when I call and have been called out 5 times to my property and say that my contract is based on unlimited visits to fix my fridge. 5 different engineers have seen to the Hotpoint and they have failed to fix it. I have been without a fridge for 2 months.

D&G, Whirlpool, and Hotpoint have taken my money since 2019 and basically stolen from me. They gas-light me when I call saying I have only had 2 visits. I have now reported them to Trading Standard UK and now looking to take legal action. I cannot believe I pay for insurance and am unable to get a simple replacement.

I would recommend switching covers and plans to anyone who is with them. Those who are even thinking about going with D&G DON'T DO IT!

Here is a link to an entire section of them leaving customers in subhuman conditions: theguardian/business/domesticgeneralgroup
This has been going on since 2015!

It is basic human right for me to be able to store my food and I'm being denied that.

Their policy states that if they are called out for the same appliance 3 times your entitled to a replacement. They have denied me that and under the Consumer of Goods Act 2015 I'm legally entitled to a replacement.

This company is fraudulent and has impacted my mental health.

I store food outside! Foxes are eating what little we have.

I don't know what to do but warn people and look into legal action.

Rude customer service, and plain refusal by the engineers that come never have the right equipment and just stand around looking at the Hotpoint.

This company is the devil, let my experience be a warning to all of you. If they can leave an old lady without a fridge for 3 months and me without one for 2 months. I shudder to think what they'll do when your washing machine breaks or cooker, your fridge or lawn mower.

I have the evidence and have done my diligence ready to turn it over to my caseworker at the consumer association/trading standards.

Update - I have escalated this to ombudsman-services also. I'm also now in contact with the media.

D&G - Have told me that the engineers have not found a fault. Yet I remain without a working fridge! (I can't make this stuff up!)"

154149,"From the outset it was a waste of money. Joined to watch a specific series. Signed up and they took 2 payments from me. Thought I was signing up to one payment plan - entertainment. End up getting charged for Boost too. No idea what that was but assumed it was something I missed. Anyway 2 plans paid for and streaming wouldn’t work. Ended up on a live chat with someone who just couldn’t sort the streaming problem. Saturday night wasted. Steaming miraculous started working 2 days later. Watched my series then cancelled my membership. BUT HERES THE CON! I didn’t have one membership no I had 3 (unbeknownst to me). Entertainment, cinema and boost. They continued to take payments out of my account and the only way to stop it was to call my bank and cancel my card. When I contacted NOW TV nonsense customer service I get told that instead of refunding me they will “credit my account” - right with my money! Eh no how about refunding me as I’m not using any of your services. I’m still receiving emails asking for payment for the 2 accounts I haven’t cancelled (or used). Terrible company. Avoid!"

Then my order is left in the foyer downstairs and has been stolen. Annah on the web chat team seems to this this isn’t a problem and I will still be charged and won’t be refunded. This is absolutely ridiculous. I am so angry. Staff is filled with smooth brains clearly, especially this Annah on web chat. What a smug horrible woman, who is awful at her job clearly."
146394,"It had potential but they have wasted it with three key actions:
1) Its too expensive for 720p
Full price for movies and tv is well over 17 quid now for 720p stereo! Netflix 4k is 12 quid.
The boost to get it to HD doesnt work on any off the apps - you have to have a stick - even on the latest LG or samsung smart tv apps! Also this costs 3 quid extra!! Also even then no 4k and no HDR!

Therefore you can get netflix 4k and amazon prime 4k - for less money than 1080p Now tv which also has to be done via a seperate stick!

2) Their customer service is simple not there, any issues are a struggle to get any support live chat is down most of the time and now way to call someone! Not great for a arm of sky! Also when signing in it constantly takes you to the irish site, pretty sure this is due to them doing doge tax avoiding methods.

3) Their line up is now suffering from the emergence of Disney+. The new movies on their platform is suffering badly already, most of the disney / fox / marvel stuff has disappeared. Only the sony stuff staying on for now.

TL:DR version. Too expensive, Low quality streams, bad service and dying content library.

This by far is the worst streaming option of the lot atm. They got too overconfident being sky and havent provided any form of value for money compared to netflix (which i used to think was expensive in comparison), amazon (best value if you use prime alot) and disney + (not the greatest value but has rights to some of the best content atm)"

The website currently says the driver is at call 12 and I am no. 19. E.T.A. late. I have just spent an hour on the phone listening to the same music phrase over and over again, in the hopes of talking to someone. Not a chance.
Additional. The delivery men (who were tired after what should be an illegally long day) firstly unpacked the wrong item. Mine was damaged and is being replaced. They were here for over an hour. Helpful but NO PPE.
Replacement went without a hitch - they CAN stipulate morning or afternoon but just seem to prefer not to. Still NO PPE"

It arrived about 10 minutes late, which I could live with but when I opened the package which was supposed to include 8 portions of regular fries there were only 2 portions for 6 people. I tried to call KFC but their lines were closed!! so I contacted Deliveroo who offered me £2.40 refund!!!!!!! I was forced to get in my car (which makes using Deliveroo pointless) to go and buy 6 portions of fries from another local restaurant which cost another £10.00, as the queue at the KFC was ridiculous. I contacted Deliveroo again through Livechat and spoke with RayMark (the useless) who because I disagreed with their assessment that KFC only charge 40p per portion of fries decided to cut me off during the chat, which was appreciated. Ironically I happen to have a business connection with one of the original Roofoods shareholders who helped set Deliveroo up in the UK so I will be advising him to get out quickly before the UK business goes the same way as the Aussie business, down the toilet!!!!!"

Two months later and still nothing! 6 different emails with different amounts, stating they would be paid in between 3-5 days time, yet nothing, nada. Called numerous times and fed different lies each time. Even ranted on Twitter and got a response, however, it’s just the same old BS. Now need to look into it legally as they have my property and have not paid me TWO MONTHS LATER! Do not use this company for anything phone related!

When I did hear from the installation company, it was through a message that contained a link for a survey to ensure installation could go ahead. Failed the survey and phoned the given phone number. Got through to a lady who said I'd selected the wrong option and needed to use option 6. Did this, started to explain the situation, only to be informed I was speaking to the same lady, apparently both options go to the same switchboard. Said installation should be OK, but she'd get someone to call me back. Never heard back, so tried for a week to get through to someone to confirm that the installation could go ahead, but the person I needed to speak to was never available. Sent a message directly to appliances direct, but didn't hear back. Eventually got through to someone willing to confirm installation could go ahead, but only on a Thursday. Couldn't do that Thursday, work etc, so agreed to the following Thursday. My brother booked a day off work so that he could house sit and let the installation guys in etc. 9:30pm the day before the installation, get a text message from a guy named sully saying he won't be able to the installation as he's sick. Nothing from either company saying what would happen next.

Went onto appliances direct and asked for a refund, said they'd be in touch within 24 hours, but instead seem to be ghosting me, so going to have to raise a dispute via the credit card company.

184812,"BT wrongly stopped my daughter’s mobile data at half of monthly usage allowance and charged for excess. Thankfully I’d set a £5 limit otherwise it could have been expensive. I’ve got 2 sims and a broadband contract. When I called BT they eventually admitted to the error( first time I called they said we’d used all the data but the MyBT site took a few days to catch up). Then after what I consider to be high pressure selling tactics (over an hour on the phone) they persuaded me to switch mobiles and broadband to a new EE package. It was going to be cheaper and better. I haven’t checked, perhaps it will be, I really don’t know. But it breaks the BT contract and had a an inflation busting rise built in. Also I lose free EU roaming and have to buy a £10 data pack instead. At the end they said that I’d get new mobile numbers but that wasn’t a problem as they’d port them through so the old numbers would be back in a day or two. They said the 2 new sims would be here the next day. Next day came and only 1 sim arrived with no info on which one it was. So I called BT again and they said it was my daughters sim and that mine had been cancelled for a reason they didn’t know. I asked when I’d get my sim and they said they would need to put me through to the switching team again. I’d had enough by then so decided to cancel everything. I didn’t like the high pressure selling and the hassle this was causing. OK I know BT and EE merged but they don’t seem to be joined up yet and giving a good customer service. I will probably have to switch sometime but it will be on my terms and not through high pressure selling. I expect a load of broadband kit will arrive tomorrow and I will return it."
125564,"Currys took £169 in November I still don’t have the item or a refund
DONT BUY ONLINE!

I bought a Vacum online costing £169 and the money was taken from my account on 21 November 2022, I opted to collect from my local store in Coventry.

A technical issue at currys means I have never been able to get the information to collect the item, didn’t receive an order number and I still don’t have it. They say they haven’t got the order due to a website problem.

Since November I have called currys six times, each time have been told a refund would be issued or they would call in 48 hours, neither of which has happened.

I then disputed the transaction with my bank who looked into it and Currys told them to tell me to go to the store to collect it - which I did on 23 Jan. after a long wait in the collect and customer service queue the store manager told me they don’t have the order or the item. I showed him the banks report which clearly proves the order was made and paid for, he then raised it by email with head office as apparently because Coventry never received it they can’t issue a refund - it has to be head office. Told they would be in touch in 24 hours, they didn’t of course and I’ve had no response at all. Told they would refund it, it hasn’t been refunded a week and a half later.

30/1/23 Have then spent another hour on the phone to raise a complaint via that route. Was told they would call in 48 hours, that was over a week ago and no call has been made and I’ve had no response to the complaint.

So currys have taken the money and I don’t have the item, this is theft! Perhaps the company is about to go bust??

At a loss as to how to resolve it as currys are unprofessional and ignoring the issue.

Don’t buy online from currys pc world!"

Passed from pillar to post by all staff who are rude, uninterested and in a hurry to get you off the phone! Waiting for a call from a manager as all TV services have been cut off, a service which I am paying for! Told it would od be up and running in 4 hours, then told this information was incorrect and it would be 24 hours and promised a phone call, needless to say I've received no phone call and still no TV and no one cares! Spent hours (4 plus) trying to get services back that I am paying for! Absolutely useless!"
163598,"There is no way to contact anyone at very, so if there’s a problem with your account then you just have to deal with it"
173311,Terrible service. Have to download a player which constantly crashes and asks one to sign in again. Very annoying when one is watching something enjoyable. Was also overcharged and bombarded with 8 attempted withdrawals from my account every day for 2 weeks. Luckily I had stopped their transactions or I would be broke now! Avoid and go for Amazon Prime or Netflix
121463,"Had an issue with crackling on the Landline, took half an hour to get through on the phone to BT, then I lost Phone & internet while testing the socket & lost mobile comms with BT. managed to get sloooww internet back & contacted BT through FB & wow, brilliant response especially from Ian, couldn't fault them, got engineer visit booked, kept me updated, phone several times over the next couple of days & sent out a 4g hub to tide me over, Engineer turned up & sorted the issue & Ian from the social media team checked in again to make sure I was happy. If you're having issues, get onto them on social media, they'll get you sorted"
118001,"A refreshingly pleasant and hassle-free customer service experience with Talk Talk. I was ringing to upgrade our current broadband services after our current 18 month deal expires in September 2022. We've been so impressed, we are staying with them on another deal for a further 24 months (guaranteed set monthly payments) Highly recommended."
121126,"DO NOT BE FOOLED

I had read the poor reviews but thought as they had a proper website and facebook page I would be ok, how wrong was I! What an absolute take on! Paid using Klarna almost 300 quid for a phone for my daughter. Lucky they don’t start charging until they get a dispatch note but not sure what will happen when the phone is never sent! Have chase for 5 weeks keep getting responses that say the same thing, apologising and saying it’s because it has to go through quality control, well unless quality control department is in New Zealand and is getting shipped back by boat, it looks like they are completely taking everyone on!! No phone 5 weeks later! And Klarna have paid them for it! Gangsters"
116385,Terrible delivery service. Have tv delivery schedule for 150:550pm. It is now almost 7pm still no sign of delivery. Called hotline but apparently all lines are closed. There is no way to track the driver and no way to tell if he is coming at all. Wasted whole day. Please sort out. Second time this happened already. Unprofessional and more like Team unknowhow.
142449,"If I could score no stars I would.
Got an offer then was reduced claiming there was “multiple” scratches I counted 2! They allow up to 5. Couldn’t answer when I asked how many I have. I believe if I had more than 2 they damaged my phone or lied.
I have photos to prove how many scratches I had before sending it.
I didn’t have my phone back as I’ve heard to many complaints of it taking too long, charging to be sent and if they have damaged my phone cosmetically then I wouldn’t be able to sell it on elsewhere.

I have all my communication emails therefore I will be taking this matter further."
164639,It’s a good app so far. I just joined and excited to see what this app can do.
152890,"Rubbish service, beyond abysmal! We have had nothing but problems with our BT Broadband. For the past year it drops out at least weekly for 10 minutes at a time and finally went off completely today. Fed up to the back teeth of ringing them, only for them to claim the line is fine or the Router is fine when it clearly isn't. They relent and send out an engineer only when you have spent 3 HOURS on the phone rebooting the damn router 20 times, pulling the socket off the wall and telling them which lights are flashing AGAIN and AGAIN. Hateful company! We are NOT phone engineers BT, YOU FIX IT! Terrible Customer Service, causes tremendous stress with their belligerent, stubborn refusal to accept the fault is external to the property and might actually be their fault. Avoid, Avoid, Avoid, for your sanity. You will become an alcoholic having to deal with them. You've been warned!"
136373,"Excellent service, speedy delivery and the phone is bgetter than expected.
Third time I have used them and my review would be the same.
Thanks."
199002,"On a business trip to London, I downloaded the Deliveroo app excited to try a new food delivery service. I ordered from the only restaurant available, Papillon Grill. I was starving and couldn’t wait, so I sat in the hotel lobby anxiously waiting for the food. However, after about two hours, it said it was delivered but was not. I was furious and tried to contact someone. The Deliveroo app said this restaurant handles their own deliveries so contact them with any delivery issues. I called the restaurant repeatedly but no one answered. The only other option in the app under “Report an issue -> Order not delivered” was live chat. I tried that over and over but no one replied. I gave up and ordered something through UberEats, which worked perfectly. I ended up reading many other reviews online saying the exact same thing had happened to other people using Deliveroo to order from this restaurant. The next day I wrote to the Deliveroo customer service email and explained what happened, assuming they’d make it right. After several days they said they were investigating. Finally they followed up to let me know the restaurant said it was delivered so they would not refund the order. They essentially blamed me for ordering on THEIR app from this particular restaurant which handles its own delivery - saying I was “warned.” The only “warning” was live tracking wouldn’t be available - NOT that they would let this “restaurant”/clearly frauds business scam me. I told them this was not right as their app is clearly letting people continue to get ripped off by this place. They sent the same nonsense reply saying I’d have to contact the restaurant (even though I had already told them I had tried and that was entirely futile). I went to the Deliveroo Instagram to see if others had experienced this, and was actually quite horrified to see just how frequently people have problems with Deliveroo saying an order was delivered when it actually was not. Clearly this is a much, much bigger problem than I realized. Deliveroo cannot be trusted."
199305,I have been on the phone for an hour and a half to cancel my virgin account. I phoned customer care. The lady kept putting me on hold Round 5 times. eventually she transferred me to another department in Manchester and they cut me off. Not happy is an understatement.

173346,Been with Vodafone for many many years 2 years ago took new 2 year contract out and phone out within a week started having phone problems called them and they rebooted phone ect and informed me that my phone was meant to be a pay as you go phone but now will be OK 👌 a week later same problems but went down with serious illness and was bed bound for 8 months. My phone was still playing up so called them again from my bed and explained my problem and my situation about my illness and informed them i needed my phone to see whos at the door and to release my door lock.they said I'll need to take my phone into a shop ?? but I cannot leave the bed due to my illness they then said ask a neighbour or friend ok but I need a phone while you sort mine out they offered me a new temp phone for £40 but hold on if my phone is a couple of monhs old it's still under guarantee. I asked them when my contract ended and was informed it will end oct 2022.ok I sent it back. there come back to me with the answer was it has internal faults NO water damage but bad internal faults but could not tell me what faults because they dont give out that information hold on the phones in mint condition no damage at all how can it have internal damage if it got dropped ect the case would have a scratch scuff marks NOTHING because I've been layed up in bed how can it have internal faults mmm. They offered me £100 which I refused all I wanted was my phone fixed they basically said no so I purchased a new phone and waited till my contract term ended this month as I was informed. low and behold I just called them and there now saying ive got another year left on my contract and cannot see ANY of my previous telephone conversations with them on there screen. Before i called them i done a online chat with them 52 texts later YES 52 all I was at was you owe £54 on your phone contract and your have 1 year left on your air time but my phone ends now thats not right I was told my whole contract ended in Oct 2022 but I've got another year air time ??. That's when I called them and low a behold the lady on the phone said all of a sudden the £54 has gone .. it's a joke somebody has to look into this company they keeping customers on yhe phone for hours passing you to different departments each time your having to confirm your personal details every time trying to wear you down so you hang up.this is a big company tactic please someone do some thing imagine if this was an old person trying to end there contract they just were you down it's wrong
132509,"Depressingly terrible customer care and I've not even started my contract with them yet.
They did not turn up to connect the line. They did not warn me that they would not come. They sent me a text to ask ME them to phone THEM about this and I'm now on hold for half an hour!! I'm going to try and see if I can cancel the order and change provider before I'm stuck with this terrible service going forward"
174430,"As a lot of professionals have stated the process is kind of broken. I think from the last 10 responses only two were even viewed by clients and none were responded to, £10 - £12 per lead it can add up to a lot, which would be fine if people at least responded. Bark will say that the first and probably cheapest will secure the client, but that doesn’t stop them sending emails encouraging you to contact client or that they’ve asked for you especially, even after 4 or 5 pros have made contact This process also suggests that the professionals have to respond fast and be very competitive which is a low common denominator if you really want to find the right person. If it was a little cheaper I would take the gamble, but as is I get more work from people approaching me directly."
126715,"Excellent, clear, personal communication with professional sales staff. They listen to what you want and ask for your approximate budget.
Then, from their depth of knowledge, they recommend the product which they know will do exactly what you have asked for.

176099,"In view of my extreme old age, I needed to downsize to something lighter; I had previous experience with the Fuji XT20 and decided to look for one on your website. Having found a suitable body and lenses, I phoned and asked your colleague to keep them for me until I had sent my Canon equipment to you.
The ""trade in"" process went seamlessly and I was pleased both with the offer and delivery of my order.
Full marks and kind regards to your colleagues."
114267,"So you want to get after-sales support about your web order? Here are your options: (1) Have a pointless web chat with a ""computer says no"" chatbot. (2) Go down to a high street store, be moved through a bunch of unhelpful staff culminating in the store manager telling you to go away because web orders aren't his problem. (3) Send an email - you'll notice that Currys don't have any email addresses publicly available - the store manager relented and gave me one and I found another one from Resolver - so far all my emails have gone unanswered for 10+ days. (4) Call them - today that resulted in a 2 hour (!) wait to speak to anyone, and then an unhelpful chat with someone who wouldn't resolve the issue and wouldn't put me through to a manager. I've been promised a callback but I'm still waiting (hopes aren't high, I suspect I'll need to join the 2h queue again).

And the icing on the cake is that I need support because of their mistake! Never before have I experienced such appalling service. You can feel it in every interaction you have with them, no matter who you talk to, they couldn't care less. I honestly can't believe any business would have such utter contempt for their customers."
160177,Great TV at a great price from a local shop
160808,Where do I start with this service I’ve had it installed last Monday since that day I’ve spoken to 5 talktalk customer service advisors who always pass me on to another person and ends up cutting the chat off and spoke to two on the phone about my internet no one seems to have a clue what’s going on and no one seems to care whether your broadband is working. This has majorly affected my working life as it’s essential working from home more to the point we’ve not been able to watch any sort of tv or just general surf the Internet as we haven’t got any I’ve had to buy extension packs on my phone package just so the kids can watch tv who haven’t been able to do their homework unless it’s at a family members house. I cannot comment on the service as of yet not recieved any but the customer service team is absolutely no help whatsoever. Talktalk really need to sort this issue out because it’s not only affecting my working life (losing time at work unless I’m in coffee shops) but also my leisure time my kids lives school and after school and also costing me money all because no one can be asked to actually do their job. Absolute shambolic service.
165016,Got the new Samsung Galaxy S10e at the start of March 2019 in the Cramlington CW branch in PC world - Sabeen and Mike were so helpful and weren't pressuring me into a sale. They know their stuff and found me a great deal too. Great customer service!

192190,The Callander itself was very nice but the binding wasn’t very good
140761,"I purchased a TV from Curry/Dixon a couple of years ago. My sister recommended that I take out the accident & insurance cover (£5.39), which I did.
Sadly, the LG TV has failed twice and had to have two replacement screens. That said, this process is administered by 'Team Knowhow'. I cannot stress enough how professional and efficient TK have been on both occassions. Their communications were second to none, they did exactly what they said they would do, and in the time quoted. The guys who collected and returned the TV called me 30 mins beforehand and even removed the stand from the TV. I literally had to do nothing.
I cannot fault them in any way and would highly recommend them.
Finally - The TK service is so good that I would try to buy any electrical goods from Curry's in the future!"
190050,Part came very quickly and was the correct one.
134095,"Genuinely the worst company to deal with. Every opportunity for interaction is fraught with disappointment and dismay on my part. latest con is annual price increases (8.2% ""in line with CPI"" but if the rate is negative, they will still increase the price by 3.9%) built into the contract, with no way to leave or even ""upgrade"". I asked the advisor if she was aware that their competitors are £7 per month cheaper for the same service - she said yes, I know, but you have another 12 months on the contract before you can switch. Or pay early termination fee. It is entirely up to you. Enough said. I have given them plenty of opportunities to redeem themselves over the years. Every time I am faced with ignorance, incompetence, indifference. Please do not consider them!"
129791,"They delayed my order to do a security check after selecting 'click and collect' - why have this as an option if it's going to prompt suspicion? They also took my money before doing a check. If you really cared about security, you'd do it the other way around, before you got my money."
134691,"How can you improve? Firstly: question the sense of sending a purchased calendar in two mailings!! Idiotic and a total waste of money. Then look into how each delivery was botched! Incompetence. Then look at what is the point in your repeated requests for the customer to let you know how they did, when I have answered several times , giving you the lowest poss score, totally deserved."
126915,"I used Bark to find a photographer for an engagement proposal. I sent out the request with only a few days notice, and got a few responses within an hour. The photographer that I hired did an excellent job, at an incredibly affordable price"
128037,"Awful communication and awful customer service. Kept being told to check the outage tracker and was told by people on the phone that the outage tracker doesn’t actually work. Dates were pushed back, then forward, then not their fault, then was their fault. The only good thing was taking their money from the 3 weeks of refunds they had to pay."

111786,"The actual service is good, never had a drop out and never really dropped to much in speed but BT like many other companies don’t appreciate existing customers.
They sign you up to a two year deal, continue to hike it up on price increases yearly then at the end they will give you a renewal at a higher price then new customers.
Typical money hungry business really who work harder on new customers vs customers who have just paid £700 with them !"

190744,"I had a query with my latest bill dated 03/11/22 regarding the Direct Debit payment being increased from £120 to £148 when the account is over £200 in credit. I spoke to Emra V and explained the problem asking why the DD payment was being increased when the account is in credit by over £200. She looked at our account and explained the reviews of usage and payment that are done by Shell, which I am fully aware of and understand but failed to explained why the credit on the account was being ignored when assessing the amount to pay. She eventually reduced the payment back to the £120 that we have been paying so the next payment on 2nd December will be this amount and not the £148."
156353,"I recently moved home and needed to establish gas and electric service for the new flat. Due to confusion with my new property address, the new account set-up was delayed by Shell with no explanation of the delay. I attempted to contact Shell to resolve the account set-up process, and was transferred to four different people/departments before being cut off by the fourth.

On my second call I was transferred to four more departments/people before finally being transferred to Muhammed who turned what started out as a horrible customer experience into a spectacular experience. My rating would have been 1-star if not for Muhammed and had I reached him on my first call, it would have been a 5-star review. Muhammed was tenacious and unwilling to simply transfer me to a different person. He dug into the issue and detected the incorrect flat address information. He went above and beyond to assist me and solve the problem. I wonder if Shell should sack the other eight people and give their pay to Muhammed?

Thank you Muhammed for your excellent support."
146642,"Would give 0 stars if I could. So bad from start to finish. Must of been disconnected on web chat when complaining about 50 times. Then spent hours on the phone trying to get help... took months to sort problems out. Ended up with sky sports free for a year, however couldn’t wait to escape. I was then charged for another 4 months after cancelling. Why is the company not investigated! Appalling would never ever recommend."

156726,Great service and communications and item arrived promptly.
186681,"Internet was down in our London address for a full day, no communications from TalkTalk. Spoke to their customer service advisor who took 30 minutes to confirm that there was an issue with the network even though (based on twitter) hundreds of people were having the same issue during the hours leading up to this. Took ages to log into my account because their website has various versions and it’s not clear which version of the website is the right one to log into. Finally managed to login and then checked the network status on my account page of their website and it said “check back in a few days”. They fixed the issue that night, again no comms around this on the day so we were in limbo the whole day. Amazingly poor service in a working-from-home environment."

134299,"Bought a laptop from Argos 2 years ago. Since the very beginning the laptop was extremely slow. I changed the broadband thinking it should speed the laptop up. I did not help and the laptop still was slow. After going through it and seeing what’s actually inside I was shocked when I found that the laptop is loaded with someone’s files (movies, personal information, bank details etc). Someone bought it and returned it. Argos never checked it and resold it. I contacted customer services and they did nothing even though I have the receipt. Be careful what you buy and return as Argos is selling your private data without your permission. I will contact the person whose laptop I have and ask them if they want their files back!"
190689,Absolutely awful. Signed up during lockdown to watch tv on my laptop. I cannot sign in 40% of the time. I keep getting Unable to Connect. It had nothing to do with my broadband - which is a different company. It’s so annoying. When I do manage to get it it can take up to 20 minutes to log in. And for every time I watch an episode of something it stalls at least four times during a 45 minute episode. Awful awful. I’ve had Netflix for years and Disney now too. Now TV isn’t a patch on them. I cannot sign in to cancel so will have to go to the bank to stop payment. Sooooo frustrating
142474,"After two online ‘chats’, one lasting 90 minutes on 12th October and the second on 15th October lasting an hour, I had agreed a new 24 month agreement with TalkTalk, only to receive a text to say my direct debit has been cancelled.

122032,The service is the worst. The order never delivered to my place even after reordering it. The best part is that the customer service team doesnt know anything about order and they do not provide any help regarding the order. Never ordering again and gonna suggest others not to order as well

I bought the hairbrushes which were beautifully presented in their boxes.....and they work brilliantly. I've had good hair days since receiving them. Many thanks GHD!!"
156911,They are awful. Never go with Vodafone. I've been lied to just to get another 24 month contract from me which is meant to be 15.50 half price for 6 months then 31 pounds after. However I've just been charged 51 pounds and 30 pounds for my next bill. They owe me 20 pounds for me not being able to use my phone for ten days due to them carrying out works.that was 4 months ago. Never speak to an advisor as its tobi a robot. Always sit there typing for an hour. Internet is rubbish. I don't care now they have lied stolen and taken my time from me. Im not paying my bill and changing provider. They don't help at all and I have evidence of everything. Please do NOT use these people. 😡😡😡😡😡
172036,"Workmen outside accidentally severed cable so I have no internet, tv or home phone. I work from home. Earliest appointment is 9 DAYS time! Disgusting service. Customer Complaints did nothing either, just kept repeating that the earliest appointment was 20 Jan. And I'm being charged £25 for reconnection. Seriously considering taking my business elsewhere. If I was a corporate client I'm sure u wouldn't need to wait that long!"
196461,Quoted a good price for phone. Service quick and easy to follow. The day they received my phone had an email promptly to say being processed. Money in bank same day as said. Would definitely use again.
168016,"All sent in a very prompt and timely manner as usual
Thank you"
160307,I purchased an iPhone 11 Pro on Friday before 3pm with reassurance that it would be delivered the next day. I still haven’t received my phone or an update on its progress for delivery.
192616,"My wife placed an order and within a few days we had it delivered, the delivery guys did all that was needed to get it into the flat, a big thanks to Craig and Dave."
157592,"I have used Hughes before in the past, and when a fault arose (not Hughes' fault) the item was speedily exchanged with no fuss.
The carpet shampooer I have just bought arrived on time with a one-hour time slot for delivery.
Excellent service!"
174794,Went into the Cardiff store to purchase a new TV and was really pleased to see how helpful the staff were and how knowledgeable they were when I asked them some questions on the TV that I bought and it made buying from them a really good experience would definitely go again
141056,Just really easy to use and we got all that we asked for.
105476,"Wow, what a surprise, these guys don't know what they're doing, again! They tell me to speak to Argos, then to speak to Satellite Sound and Vision. I'm paying 2 cover plans to these idi*ts and they can't organise the repair. I would like compensation, but I don't think they know what this term means."
107665,"Absolutely terrible. Box was late and now two weeks in and five weeks after making the order my channel subscriptions don't work. Steer clear and just pay for Sky would be my advice. Also, I'm hard of hearing and after paying over 60£ a month for broadband and TV I was told by BT to pay extra to get a chrome cast if I needed subtitles on Now Tv. I don't think I should be discriminated against financially as a result of my disability"
102936,"Purchased a coffee machine as a Christmas gift 26th November. Wasn’t suitable so tried to return to store on 27th December was told as it was an online order I had to return via online form. Tried to do this on 2nd January and was denied due to 3 week return policy ( don’t buy Christmas presents from curry’s unless your a last minute shopper because you won’t be able to return it) spoke to web chat on 4th January and collection of item arranged for 5th January, item was not collected but shown as collected on courier website tracking. Gave it time to update, no change. Contacted web chat and telephone customer services various times to be told various different things. Eventually another collection arranged for 25th January, dpd updated tracking information as item was not ready to collect despite not turning up at all. Contacted customer services again to be told I’m out the 30 day period now, can’t return, despite this not being my fault! Then requested to drop of to dpd collection point, was told I would receive confirmation within. 24 hours, low and behold no communication at all! So here I am again, on the phone to customer services and again being told I’m out of the 30 day return period (which also changes regularly) shocking customer service. Be prepared to jump through many hoops just to make a complaint. Total disregard for customers and I will NEVER use curry’s again! Not one for leaving reviews but feel this has to be shared!"
107383,Was easy to get in touch with and was able to talk to a person who was very helpful in getting my order of parts sorted and it all arrived on the day I was told Thank you
173614,"KEEP AWAY FROM THEM!
I just wanted to give the 7 day free trial a shot.
I couldn't subscribe to any of the passes because I am abroad now. I guess I was lucky, given how they still charge many of the people who had cancelled their passes.
Now, after I found out that I can't use it, I simply wanted to delete my account straight away - no chance! I even can't delete my credit card details.
You can only do this via customer service. But customer service is very hard to contact, until now I was out of luck.
Very shady!
DON'T TRY THIS!!!"
175337,Easy to use and a lot of leads to choose from
149163,"Decent quality, very happy to see the calendars. I would recommend this company and will use it again in the future

All the delivery times were met. The staff are knowledgeable and are a pleasure to deal with. I would recommend them with out hesitation."
175173,"I've been with BT/Post Office for over 50 years. In July had a letter for a debt collector for an old account going back 2 years which they had not cancelled after I switched to a new service!! In August switched from business to residential fibre account. Switch did not happen and they are now still billing me for the more expensive business service which should have terminated on August 26. 2 Phone calls from, them and time wasted verifying my credentials, but nothing happens to fix their error, but I guess allows them to tick a box saying they had made progress. They even did not know my land line number and called on my mobile! So much of my time wasted, even after contacting chief exec of BT!"
174431,"I had an extraordinarily efficient BT engineer fixing my loft aerial late in December 2021and going the extra mile as he also adjusted an aerial not working from the digital BT box. This is ""DAN"" who did a superb job of care, he was tidy, patient and gracious! Thank you Dan!!"
189122,"Delivered in less than 20 hours half way across the country, friendly helpful delivery driver and best price I could find"

159011,"Absolutely useless company,
I ordered a phone for my son, in stock apparently then once ordered get an email 7-10 days for dispatch wait 12 or 13 days still not dispatched. I email to chase up it will be another 7-10 days. I cancel the order as they still cannot guarantee it will be delivered. Then you have to wait 14 days for a refund, total BS.
I ordered the exact same phone from music magpie got it nearly £30 cheaper delivered in 1 day and looked like new."
143372,"Amazing product and customer service. When picking out the parts for my pc the process was easy and simple. After ordering the customer service team helped me from queries about delivery time, changes to make to the pc which would be better and how to set it up. Even after the delivery they helped with any questions I had. Overall an incredible experiance from pc speciaslist and I would highly recommend it!"
187034,"After a purchase I bought an extended warranty the email I received stated call this number if you would like a hard copy which I did the number now does not exist ,then they gave me a recorded message with another number spoke to an advisor who transferred my call to a recorded message that told me to go online and cut me off since I left my review I have had excellent customer service from Donna thank you for your help ."
150746,"Had a trial package 12+ months ago for 3 months cancelled it, but they still took money from my account, customer service has one way system can take money but can not refund money and have no option to do refund.

The account that been a sleep 14+ months just got made active by them and money has been taken from account on requesting refund surprise no refunds plus little con NowTv boost at £3-00 per month extra charge when not requested again no refunds.

Broad day light robbers - only way forward is to unite and block use of NowTv so it hurts them, and then only will they learn to respect customers who make them money. Customer Support worst than anything I dealt with in my life - most of the cutomer support staff like NowTv will be sacked on the spot on my Help Desk, but NowTv have trained to be one way only and hang up 1/2 way during a chat if things getting hot, make offers to make extra money from customer, make more money and offer no refund or else only offer 1/2 what they taken from you. even to give them 1 star hurts there should have option with minus 1 2 and 3 star
hope trust pilot is taking notes"
152618,"Still waiting for delivery, paid for next day delivery on 30th December. Have had two delivery slots from DPD, both missed. Get a delivery company that knows what they are doing."
126230,"DPD delivered to wrong house even though I’d done the ‘what 3 words’ on the app which puts them on my doorstep, I told them 5 minutes after drop phone notification, they said have to contact FFX first, then they need 3-5 day’s investigation, if they looked at pics from other deliveries they could see it’s not my house, still waiting for refund from FFX as I got blades from Amazon cheaper and delivered next day."

180187,"Great value for a great quality iPhone 13 mini. Phone arrived quickly and was in great condition as described.
I’ve had phones from envirofone before and have been impressed. I had an issue with a pervious purchase which was sorted out quickly. The 1year warranty gave me piece of mind. I will keep coming back."
196070,"Order a ghd as a gift for my wife’s birthday on 30 November and still no delivery by the 18th of December. No feedback from them on my emails, and no idea when the product will arrive. Shocking service."
114388,"Great guy’s that delivered our dishwasher, fitted it in very quick. Great service thank you"
102498,This order has not yet arrived although promised for the 2nd September. It was to have been a birthday present and party was on 4th September. Dissapointing
100786,"I have purchased from PC specialists before so I knew that the product was good, and substantially better than computers I previously purchased from high street stores. On this occasion I needed a machine quickly, and once I had made my purchase was delivered very quickly within a few days. The company kept me up to date with progress on a regular basis, which was extremely helpful. I would have no hesitation in purchasing from them again.
sorry, I should have given them five stars rather than 1 in my original review, it was my mistake entirely."
152195,Even thought the appointment was 7am to 8pm they were here at 8am and the washing machine installed and tested and old one taken away by 08:30. The team were very helpful polite and professional. A very good service thank you

151208,"Well where do I start? I ordered my Huawei P30 Pro on 10/3/20. It is now 28/4/20 and I still have no connection to EE network..that's just a mere few weeks...I dont want much..just to be able to use my phone which is currently sitting here gathering dust. Having chased the shop, before it closed, customer services by phone several times and also several facebook messages, still no nearer to resolving the situation. So where do I stand, no money being taken from my account BUT no fulfilment of contract by CW..can I just keep the phone and go elsewhere? Doubt it somehow, yet I still have to wait to get a connection!"
173617,"Awful service. Trying to return a device under the 14 day policy but unable to. No customer service is open to do this, there is limited online chat function but only managed to catch it once. I never recieved the returns label email and the other email they had given to email directly for a label throws back an error message.

I understand covid -19 has made the situation difficult however they cannot sell devices if there is no way of talking to customer service to process a return. Will be making a complaint to the regulator as cannot complaint to them as no way to talk to anyone!! Infuriating!!!"
131543,"In my view, a very nasty and sinister company. I have a white Now TV box, which was working very nicely until Now TV decided to make it unusable late last year. Their response to my complaint is to go and buy a new stick. I still have the packaging for the old box and there is nothing in writing which allows Now TV to pull the plug whenever they want. Whist I might have bought the box, they clearly feel that they have the right to damage it's functionality whenever they please. The words'mindless spiteful thugs' is how I currently view their actions.

I have tried escalating this matter to a Mr Darroch, apparently the Chief Executive at Sky, but I should have saved myself the effort, as he has totally ignored the two emails I have sent to him.

To sum up, my view of Now TV is that it is a nasty unscrupulous company, who will sell you a product one day and cut you off without any notice the next, if it means maximising their profits. Take my advice and treat the company like the plague. I certainly will not be purchasing any further Sky products."
188876,"I got an offer via the Vodafone mobile app offering me 100 GB of data & unlimited UK calls and text at 11 pounds a month. When I process to check out the app requested me to contact customer service. And I spoke to the advisor they offered me the same. After purchasing, when I check the app it says 60 GB for 12 pounds.

I contacted customer service to resolve this at 7:00 PM, and they transferred me between the department and put me in a queue from 8:45 PM to 10:45 and still unattended. I regret my decision to op Vodafone. At least they need to value the customer's time and the word they are giving."
115680,Fabulous guys who delivered and fitted the items. Couldn't do enough for us.
121309,Very happy with service. Found item wanted and Hughes had it in stock unlike a few other retailers I tried. Called to query courier service and spoke to someone straight away who could help. Free delivery was a bonus!
134538,Their Service is fantastic. Specially I've got the service from Jakub G. He was so cooperative. Highly Recommended.
123169,"A very professional service from start to finish.
Cards were received in a really short turn around.
Couldn’t recommend them highly enough."
148057,"Overall, the speed advertised is achieved both with downloads and uploads. However, the continuity of the connection is somewhat 'hit and miss'. I suspect the Media Hub 3 provided is also not particularly good as wifi frequently drops."
156550,"Going for a one star as no stars isn't an option. What an appalling joke of a company. Organised an upgrade to fibre, all good and an install date agreed. Took a day off UNPAID to be home. Talk talk didn't show up, no warning and no call. 5 hours spent on the phone and web chat to get it sorted. Another installation date agreed and we just found out they rejected the order. WITH NO NOTICE OR WARNING! complaints dept call and hang up on you, text message service gets you no where. Seriously avoid this company like a covid riddled rabid horny stray dog.

UPDATE: Still had no response from talk talk asides from ""we are investigating"" and asking for security details over and over without actually giving us any answers."

130623,"Ordered a washing machine which was supposed to be delivered between 16:00 and 20:00, at 11am i recieved a call saying they were at my door trying to deliver. Told the driver i was at work and was not supposed to be delivered till later that evening, i was told its because they had a lot of cancellations so delivery slots had been pushed forward(not my problem) he asked if he could leave outside and come back to collect old washer, i nearly spat my drink out in shock.
I contacted customer service to be told the same story, said if its not delivered at the correct slot allocated id cancel order, he left to go speak with driver/depot, he came back and said they would deliver the other items and leave mine till last.
6pm came around but by then id discovered all the bad reviews which i wished id seen before ordering, i called customer service back up(20 mins on hold) just to confirm my washer was on its way still, the gentleman on the phone couldnt understand why my slot was moved but then told me there was a note on system saying id refused delivery due to damage and a new washer was on its way for 2 days later..... i cancelled the order immediately, i dont like being lied to, do yourself a favour and just cancel instead of waiting around for more bull from these cowboys"

164440,"I placed an order with Wingstop using the Deliveroo app at 16:28 today. My driver lost my food and I
never received my food but Deliveroo insisted on charging me for something I never got. My
receptionist has CCTV footage that no one entered my building attempting to deliver food but
Deliveroo has no proof that the driver delivered the food and they insists that their driver contacted
me when the driver was the one unreachable. I have called the Deliveroo hotline several times
about the situation but seems like no one understands and insists customers should pay when it is
clearly the driver and the platform's fault. I now have no food and no money and they refuse to give
me a refund or redelivery. Deliveroo is fully aware of the situation and instead of trying to help, they
rudely cut me off the phone and insists I need to pay, I believe they are scamming their customer's
money on purpose."

129311,"I started a new contract through iD Mobile a few weeks ago and took advantage of the Currys/Carphone Warehouse trade-in on my iPhone SE 2020 model. I was offered £110. The phone was in mint condition but it was more a question of the ease of it all.
I got the padded envelope etc and the 48 hr tracked postage label and sent it back.
Two weeks later and several emails and nothing. I've had one email back that said they would chase the warehouse team and to wait 48 hours, that was 6 days ago. I've sent numerous emails to follow up, I've now made BBC Watchdog aware of these repeated problems people are having and I've informed Carphone Warehouse that if they don't sort this in 24 hours I shall be going to the small claims court.

Don't trade-in with them - it's verging on criminal behaviour.

ps - Carphone Warehouse, don't tell me to contact you through your social media if you read this, I'm blissfully detached from social media. Just do your job.

pps - the reply from Currys says it - totally ignored the fact I said I'm not on social media. I will see you in court."

Over 2 weeks I noticed that my internet was sometimes not working or super slow at times. During this period I measured that the average internet speed was 45 Mbs, which is incredibly lower than what I pay for (75 Mbs). I have been trying to reach BT to understand why is going on. Sometimes waiting 30 minutes on the phone to speak to someone to get this done.

108243,"On August 5, I sent an overheating graphics card for repair. On August 18th I got the answer: ""Tested on furmark for 2 hours and red dead redemption benchmark. No issues"". The temperatures exceeded 115 degrees C. After re-contact I was asked to send evidence of the card heating, so I sent a report from HWinfo. Of course, it was not enough, I had to send many photos confirming these temperatures in order to resend the card for repair. For over a week now, I have been calling ebayer every day to ask what is going on with my card and every day I get a reply that within 24 hours someone will contact me and of course no one contacts me. I also sent some emails and I recived no replies whatsoever. The card has been around for almost 2 months on ebayer. The company is perfect, but only until problems with the goods purchased from them. If you want to be in trouble, I recommend this company."

136138,".. I bought one of these from here mobilephonesdirect online a few days ago as a spare handset , the s20FE-5G on o2 30GB , was credit cleared within the hour and phone dispatched same day and next day delivery. Big Bonus also because i have virginmedia broadband at home , my broadband was boosted free yesterday from 350mb to 500mb package and the o2 sim was boosted aswell to 40GB data instead of 30 (called volt benefits) ... win win for me 🙂 Personally i think the handset is a good deal - 19 a month x24 months = around 456 or just over considering yearly rpi increases , so maybe 460- over 2 years , but at this moment in time the handset is 599 in argos and amazon cash price."
193282,I have a little update (as Virgin so often say when you complain) on my last review posted on 4 October 2022. My daughter was charged an exit fee of over £61 because Virgin Media failed to install her broadband at the beginning of her 12 month tenancy (Sept 2021) and delayed installation for over 6 weeks meaning her broadband agreement didn't start till November 2021. When my daughter gave one months notice of leaving in August this year Virgin they cancelled her broadband immediately leaving her without service for another month. Once her broadband had been cancelled she was unable to contact Virgin online so she tried web chat - after almost two hours of that she gave up and wrote a letter which had to be signed for to Virgin. They did not address her complaint and simply told her to phone or use web chat so she contacted the adjudicator - CISAS. I am pleased to say that Virgin have now agreed to refund the exit fee and pay my daughter £50 compensation. My message is take your complaint to CISAS.

144586,"disappointed to discover having bought memory i needed to upgrade my machine from 32 to 64 bit...yes i know it says that on the site, but it could be much clearer when buying - i was 'asked' about the type of dell i have and its chassis (small form factor). it would not take much to have a check about whether you are running 64 or 32. it would have saved my time and money (and it now means i have to spend more time going through a 32 to 64 bit upgrade), and also saves the time of the support desk.

ps..

i have seen the reply. the issue is not using an app to check if the pc is 32/64. the point is that in the ordering process there should be a drop down window or check box to indicate if the machine is 32/64, with an error if the type of memory to be purchased will not work!!!"

When I emailed customer service I got an auto response of basically ""we can't be bothered to help you, we won't give you a tracking number, we are too busy, Christmas has come as a huge surprise to us""

130344,"The most gaslighting company ever. I was a customer for over 8 years I was sick of never having the 5g I was meant to get on their network and the yearly price increases where new customers would always get a better deal. Any ways enough was enough when after having a email that my contract with go abroad was to change to £4 more per month with the same unlimited texts min and data but no go abroad…. Well speaks for itself. So I went to their sister company which has everything included but no price increases and I can change my package anytime I want. Well I requested my puk code well in advance, my new sim arrived and I started the porting. Over 48 hours later and abit it was finally done after carrying two phones around with me. My mind refresh on the 9th every month. This was in November and the number was ported over on the 11th November 2022 it’s now the 3rd of Jan 2023 and after their 30 day notice period should have started on the 7th when I requested my puk code.
Any ways 4 conversions with not a single one actually able to read it without trying to flip it into more than it is. I have had it all from 2 people saying my bill would be chased up and that my refund will be issued in 3-5 days as they will fast track it then back to 14 days and then there was a glitch with the system that’s why it wasn’t sent to then something else and that they couldn’t email this one over like every other email statement I had it had to be posted which makes no difference to me as will just get to me at some point and the refund will be sent. Haha was I wrong. Two more chats later and a waste of my time I ask for compensation 😂 this only applies if you are still with three but if you are leaving good luck. They refuse to close my complaint with an out come in writing to I can progress to the telecommunications ombudsman. Their system also doesn’t seem to send you emails when you start a complaint of the chat so make sure you screen record it as you will have to request it later on in writing and pay for it! Good thing I have over 4 hours of screen recording times as that’s how long this has taken so far minus the 15min call I had.



04/01/2023 update to the reply bellow.

I agreed to have the receipt emailed to me but it has not arrived. I have tried to phone both the Carphone warehouse and Currys at New Malden but both times after waiting for 5 minutes and them telling me my call was important they cut the call and told me to phone back.

This was unusual for me to visit a store rather than buy online. After having this type of service I will not shop there again and I recommend that unless you need it today and are willing for to put with bad service no one else does either.

I will have to travel to the store again to get a receipt for my purchase as they do not pick up the phone!"

But later we discovered that they did not install a metal cover protection from steam for dishwasher. Ok we did it. And just now we discovered that the dishwasher’s door was not attached properly at all, they used only a few screw so it fallen off. The problem is that they did not left the screw as well, so I hope to find right one tomorrow and re-attach the door on my own but I am really surprised by the quality of your workers service. As I said, guys were nice but they were not sure about many thing as if they did that job for the first time in their life. I understand that all products are different but still there is a common sense. I advised them a lot and I am not technically savvy at all."

I ordered a Dehumidifier which was cracked and sent it back. I aksed them to send a replacement product but they refunded my money. Wouldn't be a problem but I never asked my money back, and within a week the price of the Dehumidifier has risen. When I asked them who told them to make a refund and when can I get my new machine on the old price they said, they cant help. A group of dilettante. Dont buy anything from them!

173673,"Absolutely disgusted with delivery experience, was supposed to have an American fridge freezer delivered today as mine is broken, took the day off work and I am a key worker in the fire service so not easy - telephoned them a few days ago to inform them my driveway is tight so to either bring a smaller lorry (Tescos can usually get up here) or if they can't then they would have to be prepared to wheel freezer up the driveway (about 100ft long) which hundreds of delivery drivers do all the time for other items and furniture etc - waited in all day nothing arrived and nobody knocked on my door no telephone call from therein depot to explain or anything, the only call I had was a missed mobile number which I texted and called over 8 times and they did not pick up or return messages - presumably the driver whose poor legs wouldn't carry him up the driveway for the 10 second walk to ring the doorbell to explain they were too weak to wheel it up (I would have gone out and done it if that was the case)!!
Rang them to find out what was happening to finally be told after three calls they had a large truck that couldn't get up the drive so instead of knocking on my door or wheeling it up on a trolly they decided it was better to just leave, !!

I am now sat here with loads of melting rotting food as its a hot day, no fridge freezer and I'm three telephone calls down that I had to make to be told delivery hasn't been decided yet and may take a further five days and if the truck is too big it may happen again

Disgusted with the service is an understatement"
189086,"Ordered my AEG FFE62620PW dishwasher on the Friday morning and took delivery on Saturday afternoon.
Had a phone call from Appliances Direct on the Friday just to confirm everything was correct and that I wanted my old machine recycled. The delivery people, ArrowXL were also superb and careful when bringing the appliance into the property.

Will be using them again and will definitely recommend them.

Thank you!"

There should simply be an email where you request a refund and you get it.
The company policy says you will receive a refund by cheque but now I am wasting my life trying to get MY money back because of this company's total and utter contempt for customers."

125784,Rubbish and worse still they keep billing you despite you cancelling your visa debit at the end of your trial! I had to contact my bank who made them stop and refunded what they’d taken out which was the initial 11.99 and then another £8.99 later that day - after I’d called them to cancel the subscription! If they’re going to trade with uk public then they really need their wits about them! Clowns.
121033,"Terrible service from start to finish.
Booked a TV in for repair due to the led backlight failing. After the initial pick up things went downhill, very fast
Team Know How, subcontracted my repair out to a independent repair company and provided me a direct number to contact them with as they had a query with regards to my repair. After phoning this number over 3 days to no answer, I phoned currys. After an hour waiting for an answer, I failed the security questions as it turned out Team Know How had saved my address wrong. Eventually after answering a different set of questions I said I wanted to cancel the repair.
The next day I received a text from Team Know How saying they were working quickly to repair my TV, despite me cancel it the day before. Again I phoned the currys helpline, after more than an hour on hold I asked why this had been sent. It turned out the person I had spoken to the day before hadn't cancelled my or corrected my address. This was then finally updated with the correct information.
The TV was then booked in for a Friday return delivery, without an consultation with me and with less than 12 hours notice for that delivery. Again, waiting for over an hour on currys helpine I changed this delivery to a Monday when I would be in.
Monday came, TV has been returned to me. In a bag, as opposed to the original box I send it off with and its missing its 2 feet, remote and power cable rendering the whole unit unusable. Will now be waiting for another hour on the phone I'm sure to find out where these accessories are."

1. What happens to my free £45 gift voucher where I first joined your company (4 years ago), even I requested, you suddenly turned deaf!
2. Why your prices gone up after a few months of joining you but my contract is not to end with any plan of new changes to the price!!
3. As soon as my contract ends, you doubled your price to over £50 p/m and when I called you about it, you offered me a different deal with a new contract!!!
4. Your internet wasn't up to what you promised, it often goes from blue lights to green. - I called in for your engineer to fix the problem and the operator told me that: if the engineer come to our house and they couldn't find fault then you will be liable to cover the cost! NO, do you think I take time off work and call you to fix a none existing fault and wasting everyone's time!!! Just give me what I paid for!!
5. I wish that I had the time to find different providers but I was stuck with your contract and then we have Covid, that really slow down your active life and I stuck with BT for uncertainty of the Covid health policy and convenience sake to make life easier."

To some random 3 sim they had noooo idea where, and it was a broadband sim so you couldn’t even ring it. could I get it back? Could I pick up the phone and speak to anyone about it? Naaaah months of tortuous live chat sessions with the MOST INCOMPETENT staff you could imagine! Every time I went on chat I had to answer a security question about the number that was on the SIM card that held my number, obviously I didn’t have this SIM card!! I had to do this every single time and deal with the most unhelpful people I have ever come across!! It was honestly so stressful as I had that number for 10 years and it was attached to all my bank accounts, PayPal etc. Three were useless! Caused the problem then couldn’t fix it. Only that a local lad that worked in the local 3 store understood the absolute nonsense situation I was having to go through, he overrode the systems to put my number back onto a sim he could then give to me (hero, but such hero’s don’t stay with 3 because they’re awful, that guy left the following week to start his own business).

Honestly, I’d never wish foreclosure on any business, but the day Three goes under, I’ll throw a party at my house!"

174700,"Currys are difficult to get hold of. You have to go through so many press option 1 or 2 through to 5 over and over. If you press the wrong option they terminate the call and you have to restart.

Currys can be more competitive in price, this is a huge draw. Everytime I purchase something I have to weigh up whether I want the aggro of dealing with them when something goes wrong, and more frequentlyproducts are faulty. For computers, laptops id steer well clear. They will quote the warranty at you despite the law saying its reasonable to expect goods to last and work for a reasonable amount of time. I had a £500 laptop break a day after the warranty ended. I had to fight and threaten legal action to get a full refund. This fault is noted all over the Internet, evidence had to be sent. When the knew I'd win my case, they then refunded. It took 3 months of arguing and sending evidence. They even tried to charge me to repair the fault, which transpired to be a manufacturer fault.

A microwave i have had for 2 months is broken. It turns out its a missing part. They are taking it back but won't send out a new one for upto 10 days as they want to verify the fault. Its clear there's a fault.

I have an expensive TV. If this breaks I'm dreading how they will deal with it.

If you can get a price close to currys go elsewhere. The aftercare with faults is draining and very difficult."

Highly recommended."

183620,"What an awful company, representing BT Local Business was Cutler Communications Ltd. Ordered a Line in November, messed about, lied to on communication, no updates. Had to chase them all the time and ended up cancel it in March and go with a different provider for my 1GB Line. Order had an estimated 70 days on it. I have fibre in the building the site survey in January classed it as a quick win..... Was well over 100 days since the order before I cancelled. False promises and poor communication from their CEO Gary Palmer and from their sales team in particular Liam Palmer. Avoid at all costs, save your time and go with a more professional company who appreciates your business."

177304,"Great service from pre-order all the way through to delivery. I just specified a water cooled desktop system which arrived as expected in a pretty quick timeframe. The online tracking system works really weel and keeps you up to date on the build time of your system. Great work, thanks."
140757,Very bad service tell lies don’t bother sell on eBay
147759,"Food was stone cold when it arrived.
I got £2.50 refund for £16 spent, what a joke"
134362,"Rang GTech customer care.Very helpful as my GTech Ram was not charging.I have had it for 8 years.
Ordered new battery and arrived quickly.Now working well."
129014,"By the time I am writting this my order has been stuck in pre-production for 23 working days while percentages of orders dispatched in the last 5 days (for Desktop computers) are the following:

- 7 Days: 16.28%
- 14 Days: 73.28%
- 21 days: 94.99%
- 28 days: 98.12%

I understand PCSpecialist works on a queue system and sometimes there are out of stock components that take time to arrive. That is perfectly understandable given the state of the market. In order to make the process as smooth as possible I think opening a channel of honest communication with the customer is key. This is not what I found.

Since I ordered there have been a few red flags that make me feel uneasy:
- After the order was stuck in pre-production for 2 weeks (they advertise < 1 week on their website) I decided to contact PCSpecialst to check if there were any problems with the order. Only then I was told there was a problem with the stock of the cooler that I requested and that if I replace it ""this should allow your system to move forward through our production stage"". The other coolers available were more expensive so I ended up spending 40£ extra.
- After I few days I asked if everything was ok as the order was still in pre-production. I was answered that's how the queue system work and that I have to wait but should be going into production by the end of the week.
- Fast forward to the following week I get a new email asking me to change another component (the case) because it is out of stock so they can proceed ""without any further delays"" as they are planning to place my order as ""priority"". Again I pay more money for the amendment but I ask if there is anything else holding my order and they answer that there isn't.

My order is still sitting in pre-production and when I wrote again for a follow up the answer has been silence. An additional note is that the cooler that I had to upgrade to allow my order to go to production should now be back on stock.

Definitely not the experience I was hoping for.

Edit (from 1 to 2 stars): I have now received my new computer and so far everything is working as expected. The process was fast once it reached to production. The build is clean and the components were properly installed. If it wasn't for all the previous experiences with the process and the situation being a mishandled I would probably would give it a much higher score. Probably giving customer services the ability to mend the situation and compensate the customer when this happens (maybe with a free upgrade cover up to x£) would help to tackle the situation better."
105736,Very good came in the time window promised very pleasant off loaded quick
103618,"I was phoned by Virginmedia well before my contract was up and pressured into accepting the ""Volt-on"" offer. I've ended up paying a hiked up bill with a sim card I didn't need!"
109487,The Christmas cards we got made were of good quality and turned out to be very nice. I also got them at 1/2 price as there was a discount during Black Friday. At the end I spent 120 DKK 20 personalized cards with envelops! Good deal!
163463,Took over a week to turn up! And came with no accessories! Disappointed to say these least
159276,I have used mazuma before and always been happy but just send them my iPhone 12 Pro with a price of £485. It has been kept in a case with screen protector from day one. I took them off before packing it and sending it off. I had checked phone over and cleansed it with a soft cloth and it was absolutely perfect with no marks at all. They then emailed to say both case and screen had multiple scuffs and scratches and offered £390. Is it coincidence that this is what CEX are offering for an A grade phone. Disgusted with the dishonest service and will not use them again.
198313,"What's the point in putting a price up you don't stick to, played console up to the day before shipping to music magpie, and remarkably the one day music magpie got my console was the first day my controller didn't work shocking coincidence. Also took 5 days to assess not next day as stated"
148167,"Item arrived the next day, installed in my computer, up and running in 5 minutes
Great service."
160460,"I managed to get through very quickly, Amil was extremely helpful and friendly, he got my query sorted for me. Thank you for being so efficient!"
178825,Arrived but badly dented washing machine check your goods before sending out for delivery
178586,Absolutely horrendous ..and virtually no customer service...only been with them 3 months and had no internet on 12 or so occasions...will be booking for an alternative in the morning ..they keep their Amazon voucher and I won't be paying the remaining 21 months of the contract as they are in breach... totally shocking !
162041,On prompt delivery (and further expense) driver refused to take old appliance.
183298,Great price everything arrived on time and complete great.
145408,Easy to order. Quick delivery. Would recommend
115226,"Team Know How delivery driver wrote off my empty car parked in front of my house and admitted full responsibility. Customer services may respond to a negative review but it is only to make them seem like they care, in reality they go round in circles and pass the buck. Meanwhile I am out of pocket and have had four weeks of cancelled meetings while I dealt with the aftermath."
183586,"We were so pleased with how our wedding thank you cards turned out.. they arrived very promptly. they were working out very expensive until we found an online discount code, so worth googling before paying!"
199154,"Do not buy anything online from them. Terrible aftersales. I received no confirmation of my order despite filling out all the info as part of the purchase. Got a text 15hrs after placing the order and no other info. I found I could no longer get to the branch my delivery was being sent to so phoned the call centre to have product redirected to a different branch. Can't be done. Told I need to go to a branch and arrange redirection. Went to branch. They knew nothing of this procedure and Can't be done. Rang back the customer services asking for cancellation and refund. Can't be done. I have to go to the branch I can't get to and cancel the order in store and then wait a further 14 days for my money back. They cannot refund over the phone or via the internet. Asked to speak to a manager to explain why internet shopping requires me to go to a shop for a product not being delivered to my home but to one of their stores and why I have to wait 14days for a refund on a product I haven't even collected and is still part of their own stock holding. Was still on hold 15mins later and had to hang up. Appears that can't be done either
Absolutely useless with really poor excuses and contradiction throughout."

Keep up the good work :)"
126454,"Moved my parents from Virgin to BT on landline and broadband. BT were so patient on the phone helping to set them up and their instructions were age appropriate. My dad was very proud he'd done it himself! Now have moved my mum's mobile over to BT from Virgin. BT answer a call in minutes rather than the hour plus we got used to holding on at Virgin. BT customer services are excellent. I cant praise them enough and would thoroughly recommend them. Such a relief after the really dreadful experiences with Virgin. I'm sorry I cant remember the name of the man who set my dad up but he was apparently on the phone for ages and incredibly helpful and patient. If you can find him from my dads personal details, please let me know and I'll forward. Thanks BT you've made my life much easier!"
166905,Would have gave 5 stars but recent product arrived later than expected.
141962,"Very good quality , website easy to use, lowest prices I found anywhere on line , super speedy deliver too"
174581,"Very easy to find the products your interested in, competitively priced and delivered the next day for a small charge"
162183,Possibly the easiest purchase I’ve ever made. Delivery and follow up calls prior were seamless.
141886,Good price. Fast delivery. Battery comes in box with polystyrene foam.
113362,"Absolutely superb! Ordered Sunday night, delivered Tuesday morning!!! We were in a tricky situation when our 8 year old dryer 'blew up' and we'd just got back from a holiday. The ordering was simple and quick. The delivery guy phoned when he was close by. We had paid for the 'Unpack, take away old machine and packaging' service. Incidentally, this was the cheapest on the Internet! The delivery lads did a brilliant job, lifting it on to the shelf and tidying everything away. Thank you Hughes for an excellent service."
183077,"Brought a PS4 console with VR, came very quickly. However, the controller touch pad did not work despite resetting many times. Took it to the store to get a replacement, to be told the whole console would need to be returned with it. I ended up buying another controller for £50 as didn’t want to return the console. Very annoying as had to spend an extra £50 for something that should have worked in the first place."
101903,"The BT internet I receive is absolutely pathetic!, We also have phones from BT, on the land line, when the phone rings the internet closes down, it's like going back to the days of analogue, where you couldn't use them both at the same time and then you have to re set the modem, and wait for about a half hour to a hour for it to re set, I thought AOL was bad but these take the gold medal . If that isn't bad enough, every morning when I turn on the computer, their is no internet, WE ARE UNABLE TO CONECT TO YOUR COMPUTER. and it's driving me mad. We have rang BT on many occasions, and every time, they say we cant find anything wrong on our side, and if we send anyone out we will have to charge, We have a contract, but they are breaking their end by supplying a pile of rubbish. We have a friend who lives very close to us, and after having them out three times, and charging them, but still not fixing the problem, he was told it was because he lived in a brick house. I'm at the end of my tether with BT, and I will not be putting up with them for much longer. Get it sorted BT, or don't you care about your ratings."
181881,Didn’t have to wait too long for repair appointment & engineer arrived dead on time & left leaving no mess at all.
180524,"The knob arrived in timely fashion, has been attached to the lid of the casserole dish and is now fulfilling its destiny as a casserole dish lid knob very effectively. Thank you!"
168861,I ordered from ghd website over a month ago and the first time I emailed them about my curler still not arriving for them to tell me that it went missing with the courier and that they’d send me out a new one which was fair enough.I decided to email the week after about a tracking number because i would have personally liked to know where it is it’s not cheap and I didn’t want it going missing again! I didn’t hear anything so I emailed another two time in that week to which I was ignored so today I decided that I’m not waiting any longer so I requested a refund to which I got an email back within the hour saying that it was never sent because it went out of stock (but I was told it was sent out and to give it 5-7 working days to be delivered) and now I’m waiting on my refund… avoid
134699,"Great service! Sent my phone off in the box provided, once it was received I got my payment into my account the same day!"
168654,"Like many people here I was expecting an engineer to turn up and install my broadband with a time slot of between 1pm and 3pm. This time slot come and went. Rang customer services was told there is a three hour time slot so may turn up at 6pm. At 5:30pm rang again to be advised after waiting for an hour sorry due to the storm no engineer will come and will have to reschedule!!! This after me ringing three times. So left with no broadband and have not been even advised when this will be connected. Offered a mini wifi device which won’t turn up until Tuesday. Seriously BT please get your stories correct and stop informing customers of untrue advice. To also be told to use my phone as hotspot, really at my cost. This has left me with a serious sour taste. Not a happy customer and that to at the beginning of a 24 month contract."
130884,Great price for loads of photos. Communication was good and they arrived quickly.
110818,"Useless. Not interested in ""customers ""They have enough money not to care."

111228,We asked for help with a new hoover. Our assistant was very helpful and informative
195138,"Placed my order on 3rd January and as of 17th January I'm still waiting to receive my straighteners! Two weeks. I have used the contact form on the website twice but nobody responded, I called them and have been told the original order has been considered 'lost' by Hermes so they could give me a refund or send a new order. Obviously, I still want the straighteners I bought them for a reason. They were sending a new one through Parcel Force on 13th January. I am still yet to receive the new tracking information 4 days later! They emailed saying that the matter was considered settled but I still haven't even received the new tracking information. So no the matter is not settled. Doesn't look like I'll even be able to review the actual straighteners anytime soon. For £170 I expected better service than this, there hasn't been a follow up call or email to check in on my complaint. From the looks of these recent reviews I would say they are having major problems and GHD really needs to look at how they run their customer service department and chase up their couriers. Feeling ripped off."
100404,Very prompt response to our request and dispatch of required part.
134595,"Had 2 responses within hours of posting advert.

119759,"Our broadband was supposed to be installed by the engineer, but the connecting box was outside and a bit too high to reach with his ladder. He said he'd need a taller one and then left. I've called Nowtv since we never heard back from the engineer and the customer agent told me they'd get back to me, but I've been waiting for a week now, no response. We've paid for your services and you should help and get back to us. This is disgusting service. No Broadband or anything was installed for us."

107790,"I was without Virgin go for 5 days due to an internal problem,this was told to us by an engineer who came out and couldn’t fix the problem. During the first conversation on Saturday 7th `January I was told I could get £8 a day compensation. This went on for 5days as they couldn’t find the problem . The last conversation I had with them when fixed I asked about the compensation, their words don’t worry it will be sorted out. All lies after receiving my bill today nothing had been taken off. So I once again rang 150. Only to be told there wasn’t anything in the notes about compensation, and they only payed compensation for broadband . This was not what I was told ,how would i know how much a day this would be if they hadn’t told me. They should have told me the truth on the first call . I have been with Virgin a long time now thinking of a cancellation bad customer service"

They just couldn’t wait to get rid of us as it was the last hour before close. The main agent, Natalie didn’t have a clue and was very ignorant. My sister gave her email address. We asked for her to
Repeat it and she struggled to repeat my sisters email back. Bearing in mind we paid £1249, she didn’t even give us a receipt and just said you’ll get an email for one, still no email. Very unhappy with this experience. Hopefully when the MacBook gets delivered it will have a paper receipt otherwise that’s another trip to currys"
168386,Went into the Loughborough store this morning with the purpose of buying a new tv. Wanted some advice about the different screen types ... OLED Ultra 4 uk ect .... was locking to spend about a grand on the right one for us ........ Sadly we were there for a good twenty minutes but no-one came to help us even though we waited for a gentleman to finish with a lady on one of the in store till stations. He saw us waiting BUT as soon as he finished with the lady he disappeared out the back without saying a word to us. Sorry Currys but in the end we walked out of the store with no-one asking us if they could help so it looks like we will have to go and spend our money elsewhere .

103912,If I could give this zero I would. I’m a university student that studies from home and I’m honestly lucky to load into my lectures maybe once a week and even then they buffer constantly so I’m not actually able to use them how I should as law student. We have continuously complained and have basically been told to get over it because they’re not planning on doing anything about it. At this point we can’t even change provider because where I live the only provider cables are BT which means it wouldn’t even help to change provider. I can guarantee the first thing im doing when I have the money is suing them because this has gone on for years and it’s ridiculous!
117600,Great selection at great prices - ordered on-line and delivered as promised. Great service!
177175,"Don't believe the ads! They mail and advertise money saving offers that sound good until you contact them (speak to a rude ill-informed person) and discover that their fibre broadband, so called cheap offers, don't include any landline ! So not a true comparison. If you still want/need a landline it is far cheaper to go with someone else."

Internet disconnects as soon as installed failed for days. Promised to pay compensation for days missed, they failed to pay or deduct. Hours on the phone and if you are diverted to a call centre out of the uk you can forget it. To cancel phone sim that I never got, I was told I must pay cancellation fee of £49 and internet charge from initial £27 to £80 per month. Avoid or make it very clear what you want from their pull the wall over your eyes sales team."
185853,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. They have the best internet in terms of speed from what speeds they offer, but I have had no broadband for 4 weeks and now I’m going to be without broadband until Atleast 29th December. Left on hold, hung up on, terrible experience, not worth the hassle"
180287,"The employees were nice. I feel sorry for them as they must have to go through so much abuse from complaints. However, they all follow a script. The contracts for internet and broadband are sneaky. They include ridiculous termination fees and it is so difficult to get out of the contract despite the issues that we have faced.

I would not recommend the service to anyone! Please DO NOT go to BT. Even the employee recommended going to EE and Virgin over BT!"
193237,"I have purchased computers from PC Specialist for several years - this is my fourth computer purchase. Their service is good and communications are excellent. The computers are particularly good with very good and reliable components. For this latest purchase they swapped the power unit to a higher wattage one without additional charge - presumably my chosen PSU was under-powered for the components used. This was an unexpected but welcome change. Overall PC Specialist continues to provide excellent service and without question they are my ""go to computer supplier""."

188935,Very good service. Had the products in stock that I wanted. Dispatched quickly and everything in working order. Many thanks.
141095,Being with three after a long time very regretfully I have to say they are simply very unprofessional & disgusting. Charged me £888.50 for £10 bill. The reason for doing this was I had upgraded but didn’t like the phone & sent it back to three. For some reasons phone was delayed or misplaced by RM or by themselves anyway it wasn’t my fault as I provided with the tracking details. It’s nearly two weeks now since they taken the huge payment without notice they got the phone as well but CSR selling lollipops of 24hrs 48hrs 72hrs refund policy whilst my payments are bouncing. I’m on the phone with them every day explaining my situation & wasting my time & suffering for something which is not my fault. Extremely poor customer services!!!
177341,"I brought two Gtec & they are brilliant, I would definitely buy again,"
146685,The overall experience was easy and very quick from the start. Full money given. The one thing I would have marked down for was I was only given a plastic mailer to send the phone in. Obviously I packaged it well. I would definitely recommend Mazuma after a less than satisfactory service from another company
178039,Delivered on time was very happy
165914,"Very unimpressed with BT customer service. I moved from a rental property into temporary accomodation that already had broadband - leaving me no address to which my contract could be moved. The new renter at the prior property wanted my line, which I agreed to and now BT have been billed for ending my contract early!! Remarkable when it was BT that cancelled the account. Multiple calls have not resolved this issue. BT, I am done with you for good."

I have received my GHD straightener and I could tell immediately that this was either a second hand item, or an item that was returned by another customer. I found finger prints and also the package was damaged which I had no doubt this was not a brand new item. I have emailed the so-called GHD customer service twice (via their official form in their website) and to get some explanation as why they sent me a second hand item and to this day I have received no response. This action from GHDHair customer service proved to me that the item was in fact a second hand item. I am not sure if I should return it back but without any response from them I am afraid I may lose my money too if I do so.
Hence, my question to everyone here... Is GHDHair an scam company as I don't seem to get any feedback or response from them."

121617,"Ordered a phone on 04/03 in which payment was taken straight away-never received the phone and had no notification from the company after waiting 10working days. I chased them again to be told the phone had not passed quality control but had no notification of this from the company and was only told when I chased. Was told to wait a further 5 days. Ended up cancelling order on 25/3 as I was fed up of waiting and chasing. Was told 14 working days for a refund which meant refund should have been made by 15/4. Chased yesterday to then be told it would be another 5 working days. This has been raised a dispute with my bank. If I could rate this company with 0 stars I would have. No phone number working to contact them surprise! surprise! can only be done online. The website will not allow you to submit the complaints form on their either but funnily enough the website allows them to take payments from you. #NEVERBUYFROMTHISCOMPANY
Thanks for the reply but why would you have an old phone number on the website????? And secondly another 6days on and I still have no refund. No one can be bothered to reply to the number of emails I have sent."

194600,"The worse company!! I worked from home and I signed up for broadband and 2 mobile sim contracts, had no signal the first few weeks so they offered to cancel and change to a new box and broadband contract . They failed to cancel the old broadband so I was paying for 2 and kept getting messages saying money if overdue I phoned several times no one understands what you say and they just fob you off with lies ! I complained and finally manage to cancel the old broadband ! 4 months down the line no Wi-Fi and no mobile data on both phones , I phoned and phoned and was informed there was no ongoing work in the area Wifi should be fine turn off turn on reset etc after a week of non stop hassle I was finally told there was work in the area and to wait another 4 days . I waited unable to work , I then phoned for the 10 th time that week to be told it’s probably the box even though I had no mobile data ?!?! Who do they employ ? An investigation was raised and here we are 2 weeks later having to sit in cafes to work still no internet ! I made several more phone calls from the end of my garden to be told due to an issue in the area we no longer will have signal for broadband or mobile data and the only option is to cancel !!! I am now without internet and the only thing they have said is they will waver the cancellation fee . I went to the 3 shop in town and was told not to cancel my mobile contracts as hopefully this will work again in a few days NO COMPENSATION YET AGAIN NOT BEEN TOLD ANY OF THIS ! WHAT AN ABSOLUTE JOKE DO NOT USE UNHELPFUL NO KNOWLEDGE NEVER THE SAME PERSON DEALING WITH IT!!! I’m out of pocket due to not being able to work and so fed up"

The fibre come in my zone last mouth, so Vodafone proposed me put the fibre and they said you can cancel gigacuba anytime. Internet fibre come at home 1 month late, and when I asked to cancel gigacube they said they need 1000£ point for cancel the contract. I call 7-8 time they said someone from complain department will call you back in 24h, nobody call me back.

I was asked for pictures of the new meters. Did that. Was told all received. Now getting emails saying I haven't done it in the first place.
I have been on hold, had the phone put down on me from people who clearly work abroad.
I have always been polite but to the point. I believe that shell don't want to transfer my contracted rate because they are loosing money on that original deal.
All the time British gas are pulling my pants down. I have also been told by email, that I am not registered at this address with the current supplier but I have an account number and an online portal to my account with British Gas. Spent about 30 mins this evening being passed about from one service to another. Ended up having a chat with the switch board lady. She was very nice and polite. Couldn't really help me though.

163533,"I’m trying to be fair to NowTV given the current worldwide situation so haven’t given them 1 star just yet! I paid £199 for the sky Sports Season pass in August 2019 which takes me to June 2020. This deal was promoted for the football season therefore covering all Sky games. As it stands I’m unable to ‘pause’ my subscription and am only able to cancel it which means I will lose out, or I leave it until June where it will revert to £33.99. I have tried numerous avenues to contact NowTV just to ask what they plan to do, I have contract with them to supply live sport which they can’t. Direct Sky customers are able to pause their packages why can’t NowTV do the same? NowTV have seemingly shut down customer services yet continue to market and advertise which is extremely frustrating and very poor. I appreciate reply times will be lengthened at present, but to not even send a general email to all customers about their operations is terrible practice, even my dog groomer who operates from a shed in their back garden has been able to send emails to their customers! Come on NowTV sort it out and start helping your paying customers currently keeping you in business!"

182162,Overall satisfied with the build and especially with the organization of the cable management and the time frame it took to arrive considering current circumstances in the market. The only flaw was to find the partition of the Windows to be done on the wrong disk to what has been requested.
196600,"Arrived next day, simple to install. Thank you."
149309,"Yeah it has a good variety of shows but you pay £9.99 still get ads, only tv or movies depending on your subscription. Now you can pay an extra £5 on top of your subscription to only see nowtv ads. You could get subscriptions to multiple streaming services and it would probably work out cheaper and you wouldn't have ads. It's literally a rip off."

Avoid if you don't want to get scammed. By the way, when you get the final bill and you're in credit they conveniently ""forget"" to refund you and blame it on a ""technical error"". Only another chat and threats to take their scamming tactics to regulator will get you your money back. You have been warned! Of course, you will never hear any apologies or compensation from them for your lost time. Absolute garbage!"

143849,"i wish i could give a higher score, i have ordered two custom built rigs and both are great, but there is a but and its a big one, the ordering process seems simple enough how ever, there are huge flaws in the process, the main one being when you place your order for a specific part of your build the website says yes its instock, so you buy it all hand over your money ( upwards of a grand in most cases ) and then a few days later you find out the part you ordered was actually not in stock at all, not once but twice this happened, then comes the lack of communication, they just go quiet, no email updates nothing, so you call and you get told the same thing ""your at the top of the que sir"" ""your next in line sir"", you ask how you can be allowed to order parts that aren't in stock surely a manufacturer of high end gaming rigs can muster up an effective website that accurately checks stock levels, this after waiting near on an hour every time you have to ring, and most of the time they aren't even in the building there home so they cant answer questions as effectively ask anyone on the building floor where your at, when its finally built usually double the specified waiting time, dpd drops it off quick time and you open your big box filled with your hopes and dreams and hard earned cash in the form a beautiful piece of hardware, and they work there well built the cable routing is clean, like i say the end result is a great rig dont get me wrong but after two of them a year apart ( one for me one for my brother ) and to encounter the same issues is woeful, so can i recommend them ? in a nut shell yes, if you have the patients of a saint you'll get a lovely built rig but dont trust that the parts you ordered are in stock and dont rely on there communication skills, improve those and its a 5 star service till its a 3 at best ... you might be saying to your self well there's a silicone shortage there's covid hes moaning for no reason, and for my first order i sat and waited 3 months because i thought the same, but second time round no because bear in mind if there website says the item is in stock only to find out a day or two later it actually wasn't thats nothing to do with covid or shortages thats just plain sloppy management any company worth its salt has accurate up to date stock checking system in place, which is why its a shame i can only give 3 stars"
190075,Helpful and friendly advice which gave us the confidence to make an informed decision before ordering the item. The order arrived the next day as promised. Very happy with our purchase and to give a well deserved five star review.

Late and no communication with cunsromer and second time no show dispute of several calls to customer service and promises from them with several ETAs. 6 hours waiting and a big tv in the middle of living room to be installed. Two half days of my weekend wasted waiting for them. All they say is “we apologise”. If it was customer not at home at the time of their arrival, one would get penalty. Big organisation with no integrity and pride in the service provided"
142030,We informed bt of our house move a month prior to moving in and 1 month after moving in we still have no Internet and noone at bt seems to have any idea of what has gone on. they even sent an engineer to our new house to set it up but it still doesn't work and they've been trying to reconnect to our old property again! The management aren't willing to discuss complaints and you spend hours on hold only to get cut off or advised to ring back to expedite things ourselves. Compensation is also very hard to come by. If you have an alternative choice which we unfortunately do not DO NOT use BT.

Your response sums up the poor service that virgin gives.

Do you not think I have tried all these mediums?! Maybe one day you and your team at virgin should have to endure the issues we all have with your AI and the support team on the end of the phones.

This response is very poor and yet again wastes everyone’s time.

Learn from the feed back, the only way to address issues is to close them out at point of entrée. This will stop all of the bad feedback and repeat questions. Customer Service is number one"

It was meant to be next day delivery however a week later I noticed it had not arrived and the tracking number still said it had not left the warehouse. Called customer services and they confirmed it was lost and rectified the problem within 5 min and I received the drill the following afternoon. If the transaction had gone that smoothly the first time around I would have given FFX 5 starts strait up. Good price and good service after the fact.

Also, immediately I placed my order I realised that the system had reverted to the default size which would not fit me. I instantly tried to cancel the order i.e. Within one minute. Because it was a piece of Tu clothing the system does not allow cancellation. You have to wait until the item is delivered to the store, deliberately neglect to pick it up, then wait for 10 days plus to get a refund to your card. Absolutely insane. I will eventually spend the money on my Argos gift card, but after that I will never use Argos again. The whole system is incredibly badly thought out."

126105,Absolute disgusting attitude towards the customers with an i'm alright jack response to my inquiry.
135717,"Just to share my story.
The broadband service from this company is indeed terrible, do not get fooled by the price they offer. The service simply cannot be activated as their cooperation with Openreach is horrendous. They would sell you a service that isn't even happening 12 days after it is supposed to start. I stated that I don't mind a new landline in my order, and they told me that they can't take over my landline and hence their service cannot be activated, literally told me to cancel the current order and place a new one and of course, the activation date will be delayed again since it will be a new order.

The compensation is also not happening due to the fact the service isn't even activated yet, which makes their advertisement' compensate £5.25 every day after activation day that was delayed' a total scam.

I wouldn't say their customer service is bad, it is just the company is not competent as a broadband provider, they would sell you a service that isn't even going to work and convince you that everything will be sorted. It has been the most stressful 12 days of my life, not only working every day but also communicating with Vodafone under incredible stress.

I chose to cancel the order and not to place it again as I don't believe what they have told me, nothing is certain and guaranteed, apart from the stress being real. Even if I place the order again, I believe that Vodafone will fail to do what it promised again. It has been the most stressful 12 days of my life.

I will avoid this company at any cost for the rest of my life"
114156,"Customer service useless 2 times tried to cancel my broadband, they both said been cancelled but had no confirmation . Now on the phone trying again 5 minutes talked 15 minutes waiting and still nothing so far..."
194894,"Great service, can't see why anybody would buy a brand named PC when you can get one from here for probably less than half the price. Didn't take long at all considering its being built from scratch."
177003,"We recently cancelled broadband because we had fibre installed from a different company and Vodafone’s customer service has been abysmal the entire contract so we wanted out of the contract early.

When we cancelled, the person on chat (not the bot) told us that we could take the router back to the store and they would recycle it. We took the router back to the store and the guy told us to deal with it ourselves and refused to take the router. He told us that the chat person had done something wrong and that we should have called (except that I did call prior to all of this and could never get through - kept getting shunted to other people and then hung up on). This has been the case every single time we’ve had to contact Vodafone - call them, they say you need to speak to someone in store. Go to the store, they tell you that you need to either call them or talk to someone on chat to solve the problem. This has happened at least four times in the last year.

When we have changed services before, the company always sent out a bag to send the router back but there was no mention of a bag. There is absolutely no way we’re going to try to contact this bloody company again in an attempt to try and sort any of this out because they are useless. Now we have to take this router to a recycling centre because Vodafone can’t seem to sort out their policies and processes and their employees are too ignorant to sort anything out. Absolute joke of a company and we’re really glad we’re not with them anymore. We would strongly recommend going with another company if you can. Any perks Vodafone claims to offer are not worth it in the long run."

110699,"CEX are so easy to use. My Son looked at these from New Zealand and I have purchased them for him, to take over. Prices here a lot cheaper than new Zealand! Have not been able to check them out yet but very prompt delivery.
Thanks CEX - usual good service."

I found the config process easy to use and helpful tech support when I called up to check a couple of points. Equipment arrived on schedule and I love it."
160513,"I was charged for a service I am no longer using, despite it being an honest mistake on my behalf, they rigidly held to the 30 day notice in the contract. Utter scrooges at this time of year."
161991,Really straightforward and helpful customer service
160031,"Next day delivery, great appliance"
156390,My service was disconnected in error... Then told a. New sim had been ordered. A week later I was told my service would not be reconnected. No communication and such poor customer service.
109275,Always good quality and the product information is very good and delivery is excellent a good firm all round
187210,I attempted to purchase an IPhone for £469.99 in August and when it didn’t turn up I requested a refund. 3 months later and lots of lies from Quick Fix Mobile staff and I still do not have my money back. Never use these thieves.
195386,I have been a customer of Now TV for 9 years and Now Broadband for 3. I have been experiencing problems with changing my payment details for TV as I want all payments to come out of one account. After completing the change I get this childish message 'Oops! something went wrong.' I have used 'Live Chat' and Help but the solutions to my problem bring me straight back to the page where the problem originates from. There is no Customer Service for Now TV customers apart from 'Live chat' and the community forum. My Now TV service will stop and I will not renew due to this problem of them not having a proper CS team with whom you can actually speak with.
111833,"Unfortunately this is another disappointed and frustrated customer review. Something has gone wrong at Quick Mobile Fix. We had previously had a successful experience (2 years ago) and so ordered a replacement phone happily. However, the phone did not arrive. After chasing emails, we were given standard excuses about Covid and so on, but after 2 months we requested to cancel our order for a refund. We received a cancellation confirmation and were told a refund would be in 14 working days. It did not come. We emailed again to be told due to Covid we would have to wait a further 2 months for our refund. We objected but received no further reply. 2 months has been and gone and guess what? Yup, still no refund.
My suspicion is that they take your money without having stock to sell you. If they don't get hold of stock, you never receive your phone. As to why they can't process a refund, I hope they're just incompetent, but I suspect they are in cash flow difficulties or otherwise just unethical and dishonest.
We're left £319.99 out of pocket. Wish I had read the reviews here before purchasing. Will be pursuing further but not really sure how to get our money back. Other reviews talk about enforcing through small claims court, but there's a cost to that. So painful!!
Just avoid them!!"
153463,One of the easiest quickest purchases I’ve ever done the forms were simple to fill in the delivery was less than 24 hours brilliant service
194448,"This is my second complaint. I just registered it on Resolver so have pasted the Resolver complaint below:

The issue that I have experienced was: The account was in my father's name. He passed away on 5/6/22. I notified TalkTalk and asked them to change the name on the account to that of my mother at the same address. They would not do this but insisted the account had to be closed and my mother would have to apply for a new account. I tried to do this on her behalf: she's elderly and has lost her husband of 59 years; I am their only surviving child; I am the executor of my father's will. The person on the phone insisted that my Mum had to go through the process of setting up the new account personally. This is an absurdly bureaucratic process and makes life much more difficult at what is already a difficult time. It shows absolutely no pragmatism or sensitivity to what an old person in these circumstances might be going through or any sensitivity to the fact that they may find it extremely difficult to deal with these things.

We set up the new account. On 18/7/22, TalkTalk sent my Mum a letter telling her that her email address needed updating as the email address they had for her was incorrect. I sat with her as she spoke to the person and I know she spelled it correctly for them. However, they wrote it down as 'pazzy' instead of 'paddy'. The letter said there would be an increase in the cost of her bill as they would need to send paper bills in future.

I tried to set up an online account so that I could change the email address but kept getting a message to say there was a technical error. This went on for days each time I repeated the process so I used the live chat. After a lengthy conversation with an annoying bot, I eventually got a real human being on the line. She changed the email address, told me to wait a couple of hours and try again to set up the account online.

I tried again the next day; this time it said that that account has neither an email or a phone number associated with it and I couldn't proceed any further. I have had another 3 or 4 attempts at a live chat and have even contacted the team who deal with people who want to leave TalkTalk. They said that a senior manager would call me. A week later, no one has contacted me.

This meant that I am trying to deal with my father's very complex estate, my Mum's household bills, an enormous backlog of clearing in her house, getting rooms decorated, all in addition to running my own business and trying to manage my own very busy life. Several of the companies I have dealt with (British Gas, for example) have made these processes really easy - a matter of minutes. I have spent hours and hours of time I do not have trying to get TalkTalk to do the most simple things. It has put me under significant additional stress and that in turn has upset my Mum who feels awful that I am having to carry such an enormous burden on her behalf.

I would like TalkTalk to:
- set up an online account for my Mum, test it and send a link with a temporary password to her correct email address. This will enable her to access her account.
- make sure her account remains set up for online billing and that no additional charges are incurred.
- credit her bill with at least £50 as a good will gesture to, in some small way, compensate us both for the enormous amount of time we have had to spend on what should be a very simple matter.
- revise the processes in light of this complaint to make it much easier for people who have lost a partner to change the name on their account.
- train staff such that they are able to resolve simple matters quickly and efficiently first time.
- make talking to or communicating with a human being rather than a bot much easier.
- repatriate the call centre and employ staff with a strong command of English to provide your UK customer service.

I look forward to your prompt response on this matter. As recommended by Trading Standards, I would like to keep a complete record of my case, so please reply to this email address."
130251,Superb service. A great welcome and a very useful umbrella to shelter us from the pouring rain! Top notch.
113371,"I bought a computer for my son. Quick build and delivery. However delivered and left in a shed when we were away? On our return we tried to set up the computer it wouldn’t connect to the monitors. We also noticed it wobbled, regardless of what you did to the feet it was about .5cm out. We called at the first opportunity to be told we needed to book a repair? A brand new computer has arrived damaged/not working and they advise us to repair it? As we were over 72 hrs from point of delivery. We were away and their delivery policy is for the boxes not to be left unattended. We sought advice from someone more knowledgable and they advised the graphic card is damaged, the graphic card support is bent, the whole graphic card is sitting at a wrong angle and slopes downwards, it is highly likely the hard drive is damaged. On and off the whole day spent trying to sort the issue out, return it for repair is their only response, refuse to acknowledge consumer rights in seeking a refund, no access to a supervisor or manager to discuss resolution of clearly damaged product. Absolutely shocking customer service if you end up with a faulty/broken product through no fault of your own which given how much they cost is appalling. It seems it’s great if all is well with your product however it is a truly dreadful experience if you need any kind of assistance."
186808,Asking for a review when still not received item nor answered email regarding why item has not been delivered. If I could rate 0 star rating I would. Would not recommend. Take your money & receive nothing.
162176,"Phoned Shell energy with a billing query. My call was dealt with quickly and the advisor Samantha was helpful, friendly and dealt with our query effectively, thank you. One very happy customer."
135460,"I have received excellent support. Rosie and Damien were informed, kind and answered all my queries in a professional and helpful manner, both Pre and Post my purchase. I would highly recommend Richer Sounds Brighton."
149797,This is my 3rd build from PC Specialist. Great service as usual. Easy to use website to specify my requirements. PC built and delivered within 2 weeks exactly to spec.
111711,I could not use my Argos card and could not find out why
118918,The whole process was simple and well informed. Would definitely buy again.
131138,"Quick, efficient, easy to use and always reliable.Very good selection of quality products at reasonable prices. I especially like the personalising service."
131436,"Super quick to send out postage bag. Fast postage and payment, would highly recommend. Will be back."
125080,The telephone response was prompt however the person contacted appeared to know nothing about the product. Nor did the manager. Alternative suggested were offered. Finally I was advised to purchase a new charger. Now that the weather is warmer the batteries are charging properly and I have a new unrequired charger which I was advise to purchase.
141593,"Easy to do, very quick and a fair price"
152465,Kept well informed of delivery and easy to track where driver was on route and expected time of delivery. In fact it arrived 2 days earlier then expected.
118821,"Unprofessional and absolutely rubbish customer service. I ordered a screen repair, and realising the 24-48 hours wouldn't happen when I checked the delivery tracker TO them, which was saying it wouldn't be with them until 6 days after I sent off with their postage label I cancelled.
I asked them to send back and refund me on the 28th September. I had to wait a week to get my phone back so I could take it elsewhere for repair when I was promised that it would be sent back with a 24 hour courier. I was promised a refund on 14th October, which I had to ask for as the customer service person didn't even address a refund. Instead I recieved an email with an invoice for the repair which I already paid upfront anyway, and a confirmation that my phone is being sent back to me (as though they have done the repair, invoicing me and sending it back). Whoever deals with their emails can't compile a professional response whatsoever, they don't respond quickly, and don't address what you've actually emailed them for. I'm taking this further, they're fraudsters."
173039,"It was easy to order via the website and prices were very competitive. Delivery was on time and made by Marks Electricals own driver, who was friendly and professional. I would definitely recommend them."
174563,"Ordered and was kept updated on progress of my order. It was delivered within time given and on date promised.
Excellent experience"
161911,"I ordered a product 7 days ago. It is still waiting to be dispatched, whenever i email them all they say is there is a slight delay

176401,"I phoned the Redditch branch to seek information about a TV and spoke to Neil who patiently and externally professionally guided me through the challenges of price v specifications which has resulted in a sale !
Yet again the Redditch staff demonstrated their knowledge , they are always so very cheerful and polite so unusual in customer service these days"
192422,"Ordered and delivered within 4 days, to Isle of Wight, not all companies want to bother coming over. Constant updates on delivery time and good service by drivers."

171256,"Update 2: Richer Sounds have offered to cover the cost of the firestick which we feel is very fair under the so we have upped the star rating to reflect this.
Update: temporary workaround no longer working. After speaking to Richer Sounds (who contacted us on the back of this review) and our Broadband provider we have been advised that a new BT release in Jan ‘may’ resolve the problem with our LG tv but have decided to buy an Amazon Firestick to resolve the content streaming problem in the meantime (as this works consistently). Upgraded the review to two stars to reflect that RS did help eventually but it has been a long and drawn out experience over a period of months with no single person taking ownership of the issue.

Update: After hunting around on forums we found a tip to restore the tv to factory settings. This takes you back through the initial set up process so you can download the user agreement. This now seems to have temporarily resolved the issue and we can stream content. It’s not ideal as it’s cumbersome to do this every time the issue arises but we are wondering why Richer Sounds never suggested this to us during our service calls to them or any of the three times they returned the tv???

Original Review: We buy all our tech through Richer Sounds but we are starting to rethink this after our first experience of using the guarantee. We purchased several LG Smart TV's in the last couple of years and we are starting to see issues. (Basically, although the TV says it is connected to the internet over wifi, the LG Apps do not believe this to be the case and will not stream any content on two of the TV's). After three attempts to resolve this (taking TV away and returning it) Richer Sounds keep returning the same TV telling us it works. When either we (or indeed the engineer who returns it) try everything to make it work (i.e. connect to the net, download updates, licenses, user agreements etc) to make the content stream - the same error continues to persist. After three times on the merry-go-round we are losing any faith that the Richer Sounds guarantee is worth the paper it is written on. We know we have no network issues as we are able to plug an Amazon Firestick into the same TV and stream content using this peripheral - but why should we pay another £50 to be able to to do this when we bought a Smart TV to do that job in the first place? We have always been massive advocates of this retailer and indeed have held off submitting this review to allow the issue to be resolved – but after the engineer was unable to get the 'fixed' TV working yet again last night it was the final straw. It is very disappointing to be treated this way given how much we have spent with them over the years."

137407,"I tried to become a broadband customer. I waited over 20 minutes on the phone to be greeted by the most miserable person on earth. She said she couldn't find my address and that was it. No further help, a total waste of time and effort."
122345,"I waish I has searched here before buying from Quick Mobile. I ordered a phone in November and was only told once I had paid that it would not be delivered for 10-14 days. It didn't arrive and after contacting them they could not guarantee a delivery date, so I cancelled the order. I then had to contact somenody else in the company to process the cancellation and was told they would process refund. Nothing arrived in December so after chasing again I was told it would be paid on or before 9th Feb. That came and no refund and the next response was a word for word replica of previous email but saying it would be paid on or before 9th March. They are obviously blaming the pandemic but I've seen a Facebook group set up for complainants and this has been going on for years. I'd recommend avoid this company"
102674,The app was easy to use and the prints look brilliant and are really good colours.
188851,"Already left a review regarding trade-in process and received a response from Carphone Warehouse saying they would discuss with me BUT yet again empty promise and no communication other than standard automated response that completely ignores the issues or allows any discussion. Please be aware of any promotional offers Carphone Warehouse offers - they seem great when you are on the phone (prior to sign up) and you really feel you are getting a good deal i.e. I was offered £140 trade in (on a phone less than 12 months old) and an extra £100 promotional offer when trade-in is complete so £240 in total. If it seems too good to be true it usually is unfortunately as in summary when I sent my old phone back got a response (after 3 weeks) stating phone had 'screen burn' and could only offer £35. When this was obviously challenged and I requested to discuss the assessment this was constantly ignored and all attempts of getting in touch with anyone (let alone a manager) to have a conversation (rather than pointless email exchanges which completely ignored my issues) I put a review on here and hey presto within an hour got a response (or so I thought) but again was an automatic response inviting further discussion but only for the benefit of readers on Trustpilot i.e. creating an impression they wanted to resolve the issue - it went nowhere and I never got to discuss anything. Have eventually received my old phone back today which is of course in excellent working condition. In summary; customer service is non existent and no matter how hard you try you cannot get to talk to anyone in trade-in as their calls are screened by call handlers and this is where your call will stop, and secondly any offers are cunning sales ploys to get you to sign up to new offers and then once you are up and running the trade-in offer disappears and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. Thankfully my new provider is fantastic and they offer exactly what they said they would with no sneaky or hidden clauses and their customer service is fab. Anyway be warned folks all that glitters is certainly not gold with Carphone Warehouse I'm afraid....."
119924,"Great choice/range of merchandise and a first-rate ""buying experience"" : communication from AO at all stages of the buying/delivery process couldn't have been better - and the price of my BEKO self-defrosting freezer couldn't be bettered elsewhere online or in-store."
115567,"I have shopped with MusicMagpie for quite a while now and have purchased several items from them, mostly DVDs.

I did have one problem with a DVD once and they immediately replaced the item.

Their used DVDs are just like new when they arrive and there is never a single mark on them

I am more than happy shopping with MusicMagpie and their prices are extremely competitive."
147712,Absolutely fantastic experience start to finish. Quick and simple to use. Signed up to sell my phone and within 24hrs had the packaging sent out. Sent away that same day and had a response within 48hrs.

178076,"Really fast delivery, Cheap, Reliable and great quality!"
128559,"I had to fight hard to get the cash back I should have easily been granted when I first switched to Virgin. I had to speak to 3 advisors, and contact via Twitter, to get any progress. The second advisor I spoke to did not follow process, which was what secured me the cashback I should have received."
170390,"This evening Friday 13th November I was approached by a member of staff, he recognised me being in a few weeks before hand. Everything was going fine etc. But as he realised we were not going to purchase an iPhone 12 Max Pro his attitude seemed less interested. His attitude got a little bit snarky.. also he never pointed out before CARPHONE WARHOUSE DONT WORK WITH o2!! Why did he not tell me that when I was in a few weeks ago, I wouldn’t of went back to ask about the new iPhone, he wasted my time.
1. I asked ‘how come you don’t work with o2 anymore’ he replied ‘that is above my pay grade, anyway’ very cheekily. First of all I didn’t ask about what grade your pay is on, I asked howcome o2 stopped working with Carphone warhouse.
2. I said ‘Vodaphone’ signal doesn’t work in my area’ he said: ‘how do you know? When was the last time you tried’ again, he said this very cheekily.
He also was complaining about the shop might be extending their opening hours until 10pm. I didn’t ask what time the shop was opened too.
3. ‘Well you have no options I can’t do anything for you’
So I will not be back in the Carphone Warhouse in Ballymena."
128388,You didn't deliver the item either next day as promised nor the day after nor the day after despite guarantees it would arrive. You need to chose a delivery company that can actually deliver rather than one that gives you the cheapest prices.
127727,Customer service is worst I’ve experienced. I am still trying to recover money that was taken from my account on 17th Nov for an order that was never processed. I get multiple duplicate generic messages & call centre explained there was an error & to wait. It’s been over 2 weeks and my money has not been recovered. I’d strongly advise you to avoid this company.
185354,The customer experience was absolutely excellent. As always!
172410,"Poor signal, poor customer service, bitterly regret the move from tesco and 3"
174676,"I just want to highlight the excellent customer service that I received when an order that I did for my mother arrived broken. They immediately replaced the item having communicated with us carefully following the initial delivery and then following up again after the second delivery of the replaced item.
I can’t fault the way that it was dealt with."
112046,Easy to order and collect. Only issue was the store did not open until midday - My fault for not checking first
187162,Signal has been terrible from day 1. Not only in one certain place but everywhere! Not interested in trying to resolve issues now they have my money.

124316,"When I joined up with 3 some years ago the service and coverage were good, but over the last year or two, & especially recently, the reception/coverage has become appalling.. I can now barely get a connection in my house, which is a 20 minute walk from the centre of town.. I've given up trying to download anything, or send anything unless I'm in a wifi spot.. Its not my phone, which is brand new & lightning fast if I'm in a 5G area, which seem to be few & far between.. I asked about this in a 3 store & they could give me no information at all.. It would be good if the company could give its customers some actual detailed information, instead of rote answers & blank looks.. It's a shame things have declined to this point..."
187657,"Quick and easy to purchase. Obviously there's going to be some hesitancy regarding quality when buying a refurbished phone but so far, after a week, the operation of the device has held up. I ordered a pristine condition refurbished phone and it does have a few minor scratches on the edging of the phone, hidden by the case I've bought anyway, otherwise device is in great condition.

Haven't had to deal with customer service at all so can't comment on that aspect of the company."
101648,"Besides the appalling service, random extra charges, lies and false promises, get this:

I want to move out of a shared house to a place that already has internet, and the remaining housemates want to keep the BT contract. In order to do that I will have to pay a £400 fee for breaking the contract, and the housemates will need to pay a rejoining fee TO KEEP THE SAME CONTRACT GOING!!! How is this not actively designed to rip off people in shared housing?

Use any other provider.

BT just want your money, and will push the limits of what they can get away with to take it."
144697,The call to talktalk was very helpful.Everything was explained clearly to move to another plan which was cheaper. The person dealing with query couldn't have been more helpful and clear. Have been with Talktalk for a long time.

160580,"Friendly and good advice.
Offered a discount without prompting."
175418,"Delivery was fast and the guys who delivered the washer dryer were great. Bought from very as they offered a 20% discount on the first purchase if I signed up for their credit service, in fact this is why I chose very not Amazon as the product was the same price. There was no option to pay for installation and removal of the old machine though, which was a real pain. Very customer service seems to be non existent, no phone line to call and the chat function is just automated messages that weren't relevant to my question about installation and removal. Probably won't buy from very again for to the lack of customer service."
150125,"I would avoid at all costs.

I used Carphone Warehouse's Trade-In facility for old phones. My phone was old but fully functional and in good condition so this seemed a decent option for making sure some use came of it. The offer was only £30 but I wasn't going to use it any more.

Firstly, they only guarantee the offer for 14 days but themselves take over a week to send you the package to return the phone. So you're left rushing to ensure you get it back on time as you have to go to the post office. I'm sure if it's late they then reduce the offer.

As it is I got it back in time but after weeks of waiting, they sent an email reducing the offer to £5. Apparently, there was screen damage, though this was not visible to the human eye. They still wanted the phone obviously, just not enough to pay anything but a tiny amount.

As it is I'm getting them to send it back and will use an alternative (as long as they haven't damaged the phone themselves). I'd recommend envirofone for something like this as they seem more genuine."
131987,"Never any stock in store of what you want. Lots of staff looking busy doing nothing. No technical expertise.

I asked for refund, they denied, they said it's not in our policy.
I sent too many emails for support, but no single response. For few leads with wrong phone number, I asked to replace the leads, they have not replied on email. I think that it's fully automated, as you buy more credits, they will show you more leads but fake leads. If they are not going to response me within 7 days, I am going to file a case against the company for stealing £250."
124160,A hassle free transaction 👍great comms swift delivery at a good price.
178409,I returned an item by Royal Mail tracking which they received on 5 January 2023. They accused me of not returning it. This caused me a lot of stress and finding their telephone number took some time. Also they put a charge back on my account. Shocking service. 😡😡😡😡😡😡
134252,Never again. I’ve arrived in new property minus my router because agent thought it was better to send it to my previous address 400 miles away. Unfortunately and in no small help from Royal Mail it didn’t arrive before my departure and Now point blank refuse to send another to my new address. Cancelled my service instead do I’m 2 weeks waiting on a reputable provider. Give this lot a miss. No clue on customer service
159207,Zain jamal From Shell Shell Energy Broadband had clear insight and professional approach into my distressful experience . He should be commended. Obviously I am completely satisfied with the fair and honourable resolution because he took the trouble to investigate the facts .
174584,Still waiting for it 9days later. Royal Mail have been expecting it for the past 8days. Even with strikes it has not left CEX facility.
119779,Excellent service turned up on time did a great job
108416,Royal mail on strike and this company obviously understands the importance of getting deliveries out to customers regardless. Especially just before Christmas. Competitive prices and unbelievably first class service. I would recommend always checking out their prices and service anytime of year. I have always being impressed by both.
154328,"BT Twitter process worked really well. Rapid and helpful response, problem resolved. Thanks!"
113509,Superb! Would highly recommend this company 🤩
109148,good quality products. excellent service.
150835,STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY! THEY ARE NOTHING BUT THIEVING SCAMMING B@STARDS! Bank chargeback or small claims court is the only way you’ll get your money back. One year later and I’ve no phone and no money but I do have a court date 🙌 Join the Facebook group for more.
138312,"I was offered £350 for my iPhone 12 128GB Unlocked, believe me this phone was indistinguishable from new, always cased with screen protector. They said it was scratched , not true, offered £300 which I refused, they then upped it to £310 which I refused. Eventually returned without the box I sent it in.
I bet very few people stand their ground and they rely on reducing their offer. THEY THEN LIST AN EQUIVALENT PHONE FOR £549.95!!
There is now a very happy new owner who paid £350, sold in one day on Facebook Marketplace, new owner said it could be mistaken for new!"
184615,"Delivery ridiculous waiting over a week
When you phone told someone will look at it within 30 days!!"
185076,I like the product but delivery times is quite slow
109549,"Bought a Samsung A12 and offered me £60 trade-in for my old phone. Received new phone no problem, sent my old phone for trade in. Over a week later not heard back from them. Contacted on line chat who said they would put my case as urgent. Following day received an email from them saying my phone had screen burn, I know definitely no problem with the phone I sent (reading other reviews this is a common excuse not to pay you what they offer) and they can only offer £10. I asked for the phone to be returned, two emails which have not been replied to and online chat. Still waiting for the phone to be returned."
131906,Fast turnaround and a good quality product as always. Some pictures print a little darker than they appear on the screen so make allowances for that.
103014,Ordering and delivery smooth including removal of old freezer
182909,"I was sold a package, which included an 02 SIM card at an extra £6 per month, saying it would improve my internet speed, it didn’t, changed package for up to date modem, sorted problems, 02 are hassling me for £6 / month for something I did not need or want!!, also you have overcharged me this month, for no reason at all !!!"
179941,"they make u download the player also along with it which makes now tv more horrible and unfit to use. i am still stuck on first episode of GOT a s I am struggling with the now tv player. its not compatible, the sound is low quality and subtitles need to switched on agagin and again.i will not recommend this to anyone. now tv is worst tv player i ever seen.utter waste of time."
106275,Very happy with my personalised Christmas cards and calendar!
192130,Still awaiting delivery! your useless couriers tried to deliver Saturday 20th despite twice being told its a business address and its me that has to contact them to rearrange rather than the other way around
162064,Still no phone after the Talk talk engineer visit. Now their systems are down and they can't speak to customers. Wow
132677,Very straightforward when downloading or installing your vsts. This is the only place i shop for my Vst’s
127126,Good service and very helpful with all the problem
164912,"I have send my TV for the repair. I spend hours on the phone to get my repair booked. They either have some booking issues or system was not working correctly. Finally I have managed to get the pick up booked and when I was waiting for them on the pick up day they called me telling me that they forgot to take the box for the tv so they will come back some other time. Forward next week they arrived and collected the tv. Collection was actually good. They remove the stand, pack the tv and took it with them. Delivery on the other hand was just horrible. They did not handle my TV with a proper care and they said that they will not help with putting the stand back even though I was told by repair team that they will carry the installation. Driver was extremely rude and when I continue asking for help he drove off swearing at me. I immediately called to complain but I doubt they will do anything. They only said that can book another date for installation. I called my neighbour to help me instead. I never experienced anything like that before. I will avoid buying anything from Currys again."
135926,"I ordered hair straighteners but unfortunately Hermes 'lost' the order. I contacted ghd, the response was prompt and a replacement was sent out with a different courier. Excellent company."
167672,"So following on from my review yesterday (pasted below) 24 hours have passed and surprise, surprise! No call back from a manager and no voucher in my inbox for my write-off.

Just another breach of their SLA's!

Absolute joke.

Yesterdays review;

I have had an engineer to come out to first replace a bearing (1st visit) , then again to replace a pump (2nd visit), then again to be told they cant fix it there and then as need to order part (3rd visit) they come back and say still not fixed need to order another part (4th visit)

At this point the same engineer has came to my house 3 times and advised due to the amount of visits/repairs to call in to discuss a write off. This was 30th October 2021.

I called in the next day and asked what my options are the advisor said theres no report uploaded yet which was annoying as this is slowing everything down for me.

I tried the following day but couldnt get through after 3 attempts. On Tuesday 2nd November i called in and the advisor told me its a write off and id have my voucher by Friday.

Friday came and now this advisor is telling me i was misinformed i should get it by Tuesday as its 3-5 working days. His tone just made everything worse as his confidence was so strong that the other person was wrong and that id definitely get it by Tuesday.

Tuesday has now come (today 9th November) i am still without my vouchers!!!!!! I called in and the advisor told me she doesnt know whats going on and will escalate it which can take another couple of days!!

How is this acceptable?

My dryer has been out of action since 23 October 2021 which is 2.5 weeks, during this time of weather with nowhere to dry my clothes is really frustrating.

Im paying for a service which im getting no value from its actually disgusting with what ive had to put up with, the number of times ive had to call (being hung up a few times) and the number of times ive been misinformed!!!!!

Before writing this review I have spent just under an hour on the phone (55 mins) to get this sorted, to give currys knowhow a chance to rectify the problem but after raising a complaint and requesting to speak to a manager they said it could take 24 hours like i havent waited enough. You can just tell they dont care. Some companies are reviewed quite poorly like this one and it doesnt reflect their business but after my terrible experience I can see exactly why they are rated so poor!!!!

Repair ref 997021"
186682,"Good, honest, professional service. Supplied exactly what was ordered within a good timeframe; kept me informed of shipment from order to delivery. Thank you!"
153045,"Excellent service from Craig D and David IS. My dishwasher was delivered when requested with a text the day before giving me a time and a call when they were on the way. The web site is clear what they will do for free and what there is extra charges for (unwrapping, installing etc.) I just wanted delivery and that was done with efficiency and good humour. Full marks to Marks."
106806,Diabolical. TV delivered and inspected by the delivery company. Damaged. 3 phone calls lasting 20-40minutes at £0.05 per minute to organize re-delivery. They deliver the same damaged TV a week later. Call today a further week later taking another 40 minutes. TV is out of stock. Currys site says the TV is delivered. Currys are dead to me!
184390,"quick responses, would have liked a few more options"
156243,"I visited your store in Tunbridge Wells (Victoria Place)today and was dealt with by the branch manager.He was extremely helpful with a 'phone problem, explaining everything very clearly and going the ""extra mile"" in customer service.I was most impressed and will buy all my phone needs from you in future.Employing people like him is a good way to enhance your business and create happy customers.
Very many thanks.
I hope this message is passed down to him by his superiors."
198559,"Delivery in time, no delay, item as expected, can't complain to be honest Curry's one of the best"
199240,Was looking for a particular product. Very were the most competitive with their pricing and the delivery was super quick.
120777,Everything I ordered came on time good quality and and mostly affordable at this time of year we need this
164356,Sat in the room next to the router and no internet. Went with virgin full fibre for good speeds but it is appalling. Ethernet is fine but wireless around the house is awful. Had an virgin engineer visit a few months ago who recommended 3 wireless boosters pods and a different router for our house but Virgin said just one booster and wouldn't meet his recommendation which they said wasn't in the notes. I had his call card with the recommendations documented. It’s like they know it’s terrible but don’t want to do anything.
121429,Mr Memory have a very good site making my purchase easy. When I no longer required the items the return process was simple and hassle free. Couldn’t recommend highly enough
130470,1st rate service as always from the crew at Hughes North Walsham .
112806,"Clearly the items sent are not quality checked, really disappointing to see a very visible fault on my item. It should never have been sent out in that state"
179659,PANASONIC TV PURCHASED GOOD PRICE FREE DELIVERY UNLIKE CURRYS WHO CHARGE £5.00 AND VERY PROMPT SERVICE. WOULD RECOMMEND GEOFF BURCH. ORDERED ON SATURDAY DELIVERED ON SUNDAY.
111354,"Good service, I was informed all the time , I received the product at the specified time"
197664,Polite. Very helpful and helpful when you’re young lady realise that I was a pensioner struggling in these hard times.
156479,"Terrible. DO not bother. Since attempting to join there have been error after error which they blame on OpenReach but its down to them inputting the details in incorrectly.

Now my other broadband is cancelled and this is delayed by weeks, I work from home so am screwed now and cannot work.

If you call expect to be on hold for 30 mins to get through to someone who cannot resolve the issue"
197273,"Marked down my immaculate device just as other customers have experienced. I’m not blind, the phone was pristine and sent to them very well packaged so wasn’t damaged in transit unless it was thrown from a building. They used to be honest but not since changing hands. Avoid."
193290,"We went into the Gosforth branch armed only with a budget for a used camera and lens and very little knowledge, We were assisted by a young fella called Jonathan Braban who talked us through what was available and what would suit us best. We left with both a camera and a lens and bit more knowledge. Thanks for you assiatance."
153651,Brilliant very pleased. Ao very easy to use to use took away old product and fitted new one for not much extra. have now had the product nearly a week and I love it. Would definately reccomend ao to friends.
196884,Very good service and quick would recommend this company
133969,"Curry's had available stock in the store

Clean environment

No pressured sales

Staff available for enquiries.
Albiet wait to be served was 10 mins due to tills computer being down and limited tills available. But eventually got the sales with a polite and apologetic operative.

Love my LG32inch TV which was on offer"
115424,Very easy to choose a card and customise. The cards were delivered promptly and are good in appearance and quality. Good value overall
115512,Shocking service non stop since I started working from home full time relying on my internet for work. Signal is intermittent or cuts out for no reason and tv buffers and goes blurry. After 2 failed engineer appointments you're now refusing to apply GSOS payments because you rejected the first one despite telling me it was booked and lied to me on the phone the day before and twice on the day of to say the engineer was coming and the second time told me the appointment was booked but I rang today as they hadn't turned up again and get told the appointment was never booked. The engineer better show up tomorrow otherwise this complaint is going to the ombudsman!!!
138331,"Very unfortunate experience.
I ordered TV and 1 day before the delivery I received an email problem with stock and it won't be delivered.
Very bad experience 😕
Definitely not recommend"
172668,"A very positive experience (my second with the company). Easy to customize the machine being ordered and the build quality seems excellent.
The build time was longer than I might have hoped for due to the case originally ordered being unavailable but not worth deducting a star for - I took the delay as an opportunity to upgrade a couple of components which was acheived without any problems.
The machine I previously bought from the company 8 years ago is still going strong but is now my 'second' PC."
132594,"I used this company in December 2022
They gave me a good price for my phone which I was very happy as they transferred my money very quickly into my account.
Definitely recommend"
171336,"Hughes Colchester are absolutely brilliant. Greg, Jay, Andrew and Gaynor have been amazing.

I was going to buy a new washing machine in Currys but thought I would pop into Hughes first that was next door. It was my first time in Hughes and I had no idea they offered a rental service.

Once in the store Andrew explained how it all worked and was really helpful. I decided to try out the rental servics because the water is hard in Colchester and is not good for electrical items as they tend to break down. By renting, everything was included breakdown cover.

Greg and Jay who came to my house to fit the washing machine were outstanding and super helpful 👏. They both worked really hard and Hughes are lucky to have them both working for them. They are credit to the company.

I had to ring customer service up and Gaynor rang me back. Gaynor was really helpful.

All in all I have had an outstanding first experience with Hughes Colchester and would definitely recommend it."
194091,So far rubbish internet just won’t load pages says I have fast speeds but won’t load a simple page have to go back onto mobile broadband to get pages to load wish I’d stayed with bt virgin are crap
181327,Lovely customer service from Halid S. I understand the energy companies are having a tough time at the moment but I received prompt and kind responses to all my questions.
182014,"We got a time slot for the return of our repaired TV 15.45-19.45 so my husband went out saying he’d be back before 15.45. I got a call at 14.20 from the delivery man saying they’d be here in 10 minutes. How I wish that I’d said I wasn’t at home and wouldn’t be back till 15.45. My husband doesn’t have a mobile so I couldn’t call him. When the delivery men arrived I asked one of them if he could take the tv we had borrowed off the stand which he grudgingly did. They brought our tv in and I got the stand for them. They asked for the screws but I didn’t know where my husband had put them and I couldn’t get hold of him to ask. So they dumped my 65inch, very heavy tv on the floor and said they had other jobs to do. I wish I had insisted that they came back to finish our job."
143598,I like dealing with BuySpares. It's very easy and they helpful if you're not sure about something. Recommend
165796,UTTER SHAMBLES. They sent me a reference number in a text with a phone number to call. I call and they don't recognise their own reference number. TOTALLY HOPELESS AND A WASTE OF LIFE CHASING THEM IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE. My vulnerable 84 year old Mum has had a faulty line for 2 months now and they keep taking her money despite rubbish service.....AVOID AT ALL COSTS
116249,I was kept informed all the way through when my appliance was coming. It turned up in the time slot allocated. The delivery driver was very polite and helpful. Nothing too much trouble. Can honestly recommend appliance direct. Will definitely buy from them again if there's anything else we need.
139350,Poor customer service and internet consistency
194322,"Purchased a American fridge freezer only to find that the day it was delivered the item was reduced by £20 plus it as some small scratches on the front door, tried to contact customer service several times and never managed to speak to any. Very disappointed."
130250,So far the app is great! Easy to understand and user friendly.
165400,"I was offered a broadband package upgrade towards the end of my existing 2-year contract, which included a free digital phone (Alexa Advanced Home Phone). I understand that everyone will have to a digital phone service by 2025, so I decided to give it a try. I then discovered that BT would not guarantee that I would keep my existing landline number and that it might be allocated to someone else. I established that BT did ""own"" my number, so they could in theory re-allocate it to me. When I pointed out that my contacts could then be phoning my old landline number and some unsuspecting person would be getting frequent ""wrong number"" calls, BT agreed that that would happen. Finally, they could not tell me how much notice I would have of a change of number and that it could be only 1 or 2 days. I gave up at this point. It looks like 2025 is going to be a bad year for telecoms customers."
156408,"Made an order for local takeaway. Food arrived, starter missing. Used the app to report missing item, sent photos of food and receipt. Mistakes happen, happy to just be refunded. Received a standard looking email a few hours later saying we’ve looked at your case and no refund. Erm, what?! I’ve paid for food that never came. Now have to spend my own time and effort trying to chase this further. How many others are they doing this to?? No live chat and dreadful customer service. Will always now use Just Eat instead - any problems I’ve ever had they’ve been incredibly helpful. Lesson learned."
123374,"Credit where credit is due, Southern Electric downed the overhead telephone wire to our house, cutting all comms and while running a business out of our house and while we were isolating. BT got on the case and by the end of the day had two men out who fixed a new wire, restoring comms, wifi and TV. Credit where credit is due, thank you for great service BT."
112317,Was really helpful.. await the amendments
131745,"Great part, speedy delivery. Hover is like new again"
133707,Appliance arrived 2 hours before time slot. Good job I was at home

Laptop seems a lot better with the new ram. It stop crashing using powerful software. Highly recommended"
135205,Great product quick delivery fantastic company happy Xmas
107736,"10 days since my second review and since then, not a single thing has happened to progress my order. I did receive two text messages, on different days, saying somebody would call me in the afternoon to discuss my account, and then nobody called either time.

I’m in my third month of waiting and we still haven’t got past the first step of having the external engineer arrive. So far, I’ve been told:
- the external work has started, but just not finished (not true, nothing has happened).
- it will be done after the initial date I was told due to a backlog, but Open Reach have a scheme to catch up on all late jobs by 21/12 (didn’t happen).
- Open Reach have a shortage of skilled engineers (I’m in London, not the middle of nowhere, and I’m sure this isn’t the first time they’ve been asked to install fibre in London).
- Open Reach have a plan to train staff to be able to do the work I require (it’s just installing my internet?!?! They’re not a start up company and this seems a pretty standard job for them?!).

The BT customer service people always pick up quickly when I phone, and are polite, but neither of us know what to say to each other at this point.

BT have escalated my case with Open Reach three times, which results in nobody doing anything still.

Before I get a response on here, I have not contacted anybody via social media. For what? All they will tell me is “open reach still haven’t done anything”.

I just want internet LOL"
182052,The worst costumer service.the worst broadband.do not signed up with Vodafone
161390,"Customer service are rude and terrible we have called 3 times because we have just opened an account with talk talk and our WiFi is still not working after being given extra charges and even having our number blocked and hung up from! Do not use talk talk unless you want to be involved with this slack, rude service! P.s had an email today about the engineers coming out to fix the WiFi for yesterday with a warning saying we will get another fine if not home?! (EDIT) we eventually got through to the someone high up and has all been resolved and working better change changed from 1 star"
115956,"Shocking service from Very, a well known retailer so I expected more. I never received an item and yet I am being passed here and there trying to obtain a refund when I have provided proof that the item was never received and that I have never received a refund. Keeping hard earned money when no item received, very disappointing from Very. Should have purchased from my usual trusty John Lewis."
127903,Delivered what I ordered quickly. Thank you
149085,Silentnight mattress purchased online and delivered by Argos flawlessly .
149535,"Great service. Got online quote and sent laptop by courier on 1st October. Laptop checked and full amount of quote paid into the bank on 4th October. Quick, easy and great experience."
143549,"Buying a new iPhone through the website was as expected. Except trade in value didn’t include the £100 bonus on offer.
I contacted customer service who said the £100 would be added once trade in phone payment was made.
My old phone was sent off, received and signed for on 30th March.
I then contacted customer service to find out what the latest was on 11th April. I have now been contacted to say my phone is being returned with no explanation. It’s in perfectly good working order and I am convinced it’s a way to avoid paying the £100 trade in bonus.
It’s a scam and amazed it’s allowed.
Be warned!
Oh and before someone says contact me through social media, I don’t have any social media accounts

Update 15/04 : All contact has been through the supplied email address and no explanation given."
149483,"Next day delivery phone in percent condition very reasonable price
Would buy an again when I want an upgrade"

You can't buy a mobile phone without checking carphone warehouse."
111110,"Tried reporting fault for elderly neighbour after 2 new replacement poles put up. Tried to make appointment for engineer to call but couldn't. Was told agent would contact me, which he did, but after finding out I was a neighbour terminated the call. Have since tried further 8 times but no return call from 'agent'."
111570,It started beeping with a RAM problem after 24 Hours the tech help offered advice but would NOT send out an engineer to FIX the problem now running with 50% of the RAM I paid for very very disappointed
162092,Easy to use website that allowed me to build a great setup for a decent price. Arrived quickly as well. Would definitely recommend.
165523,"Was kept informed about my delivery,and when to expect it. Actually arrived earlier than promised. Its a great item."

158305,Took a while to get through but once I got through the service I received was very helpful. Dino H was very professional and answered all my questions and pointed me in the right direction.
167879,Tiffany was extremely helpful and efficient in explaining to me how my credit note would be used. Good customer service isn't easy to come by these days so its always nice when you are treated right.
199000,Cold caller from carphone warehouse trying to sign me up to iphone 13 when I said I wasn't interested he asked me if I would prefer bum sex! p.s this is the clean version
139799,"Bought a new tv online but was unable to install it - too techy! Asked Hughes to send someone round to sort it. Man came round within an agreed time frame, texted prior to arriving and did the job in 10 minutes! Well pleased!"
185815,Excellent customer service! Nice engineer to deal with
142175,Easy to order online. Competitive pricing. Straightforward delivery. Kept informed as delivery time. Got a call when 10 mins away. Paid for box to be unpacked and removed. Delivery man put fire in place after checking all parts there. Will use AO again. Fire as described in online vid.
160921,"Utterly terrible company - dishonest and sneeky would never touch again. After being a customer for two years, renewal at a lower price. Once installed they changed package that i was on and said i needed to pay more depsite evidence of renewal price. Customer services awful, do not call you back and long queue wait."
192143,"I have received 5 cold calls from you over the last 3 days. This is harassment. Why will you not stop calling? I ask to actually find out what’s going on and they hang up on me only to call back later. Furious.

That is no reason to be hanging up on people. Your company solicits cold calls. I am not a customer of yours. I should not HAVE to fill in online survey questionnaires to stop you harassing me."
145223,It was quick and easy to order and very swift delivery the delivery men were great as well very friendly people would definitely use again
152128,Glad i left the worst company in the world he’ll wood be easier to go to.
140108,Very disappointing ongoing issues over last year with returns items still not credited
159301,"The ao website gave clear measurements for fridge-freezers, as we needed one that would fit a certain sized space. We’re really happy with our Liebherr 60-40 fridge freezer. It’s nice having more fridge space and it’s a good lay-out inside.

We were able to have our new fridge-freezer delivered in less than a week. We had excellent communication from ao throughout. Useful things to know before the delivery, like ensuring our old fridge-freezer was defrosted before the delivery men took it away for recycling.

On the day, we were given our afternoon delivery slot in plenty of time, so that we could plan our day. We could also track where the delivery lorry was, which was helpful. One of the delivery men rang us to let us know they were on their way to us. Our new fridge-freezer was already unpacked for us by the drivers, as we’d paid for that. They were great to deal with and even gave us to ao teddies for our little boys, which they were happy with!

All in all, we’re happy with our purchase, ordering it and the delivery. We’d never used ao before, but we’d happily use again and can recommend to others as well."
152183,The store went above and beyond to get a problem sorted with the best outcome
180867,"I'm 10 days into waiting for my service to start and I got a call that they need to cancel my order because my address is incorrect (I selected my address from their drop down list). But basically my address was correct, it's just that there was a discrepancy across their systems. On top of that, I need to create a new order and wait for another 2-3 weeks. Obviously, they cannot amend any order details, despite what they say on their site. Seriously bad."
186289,"Phone dead. Rang TalkTalk. They did a test. Found a line fault and escalated it.
As with all these experience questionairres you ask far too early over some aspects. I was dealt with very well but you cannot ask if my problem was resolved so soon after it was reported but so far I am very happy with TalkTalk."

Even over the busy period of Christmas a friendly and helpful young man called Richard came and repaired the leak and more over when I had another issue there was a wonderful lady called Heather from the finance department who could not do enough to help me resolve my problem, I can’t thank her enough for her support and customer care. Thank you Mrs Tooley"

134714,"Signed up on entertainment package.

Shocked to discover that as the most expensive tv service for their basic package they want you to pay an extra fiver a month on top to remove adverts from the beginning of their programs when no one else does for less money.

And to add insult to injury, I went to Spain, tried to use it on my tablet only to be greeted by a message saying that because of Brexit, I cant watch any shows, and they even said other providers do the same.

This has meant that two weeks of my membership are a waste, and I signed up for Netflix to watch something in the evening with them. And guess what? It worked surprise surprise.

Not much over half the cost, no adverts and the ability to use outside the UK.
They seemed to have more content too.

May well not be using the rest of my Now membership and will keep my Netflix subscription."

167479,"I placed my order for broadband on the 8th March. 6 weeks later and I'm still yet to be connected. They don't seem to have any clue as to the problem or simply don't care. I've phone up and emailed countless times but it's like trying to get help from a goldfish. Nothing is remembered, acknowledged or followed up. Their complaints procedure seems to be dropping it straight in the bin because you'll never hear back. I keep getting told it's a priority, so God knows how slow they'd normally be. This company fills me with despair. And to top it off, I pay for their TV packages which I'm unable to use without internet."

107044,"Not very helpful when trying to access my email, but it is simply looping round in circles giving an error. When trying to access my billing it was the same issue. When contacting customer service they wanted my billing number, but I couldn't give it because I couldn't access it."
176206,I am updating a previous reference which was poor - and which reflected the very poor initial response which I received from Shells smart meter installer agent SMS. I then raised a complaint with Shell and was transferred to Zoran M who acted as my case handler - his response was immediate / the steps he explained were constructive and clear and he achieved a resolution well within the timescale he had set out. My thanks

Then new time slot Monday 2 to 7pm
No show

Called Argos elk mill Chadderton I ask will it be today
And they said unfortunately stock
Is unavailable and cancelled my order
I now have to wait 5 to 7 days for a refund
The item is available if I picked it up from the store just like magic but not for delivery
A waste of time and the worst customer service experience ever
Don’t reply by saying sorry just deliver what is says on your fake advertisements there is no same or next day delivery"
187596,This company are sharks the price mark up items is appalling. I brought in a oppo a94 phone that had been only 3 months old and was always in a case and had a screen protector. i was told it was in b condition as it had a mark which it didnt have they tried to tell me it was the silicone cover how does a silicone cover scrap a phone. I could understand if i was an labour worker ( sand dust grit ) getting into it. but im a house person who very rarely used the phone. So there was no chance. I think the staff are told to damage stuff to pay out less. I will never return to the enniskillen store again or any store for that matter after being a loyal customer. Crooks. Its funny they had the phone for over 1 hour and 30 mins and all of a sudden it was scratched before they got it. It still had back film on it from new for god's sake.

167670,"Sent tv in for repair. Should have been delivered this morning.
Spoke with customer service who couldn’t tell me anything.
Wasted a full day waiting.
Still don’t know when I'm getting my tv back.
Waste of time company with atrocious customer service."
160546,Was expected for next day delivery. nearly 3 weeks and it still hasn’t arrived.
132467,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! This company is a hoax no surprise there constantly changing names to hide the bad reputation no doubt! Had my phone insured with them paying the monthly premiums totalling over £600 the day comes I finally break my trusty old phone no worries I though it’s insured! Oh how I was mistaken ! First issue is getting through once I finally got through I was not happy about having to pay an excess that near enough covered the repair of the phone so I wanted to complain..... oh my what a mistake the was, I was told I would get a call back from the complaints department in 72 hours (3 day wait just to complain!!!!!) well they never rang me back so a week later I try again after an hour on hold I get though to just be told the same after telling them no that’s fine I’ll wait now for you to connect me I eventually get though to be told there’s nothing they can do unless I pay the excess basically rendering the monthly premiums pretty much pointless. Do not waste your time or money with this disgusting company save it and give it to your local repair guy/lady if the day ever comes your tech let’s you down. Oh and if you are gullible enough to fall for this scam read the small print as your phone is not actually insured to any value only covered for a replacement basically meaning you can’t get a single penny out of them only a like for like replacement. Shame there monthly premiums do not reflect this as they still charge me the same amount from the day my phone was brand new till now."
186967,Your delivery drivers were friendly efficient and helpful. They took care and installed a sense of trust in your company.
165274,I have just bought for the first time from this company and must say I am highly delighted with my purchases and the service I bought a beautiful double bed set well impressed also a fleece mattress cover. love it couldn’t believe the cost so thank you Studio will definitely recommend your company in future so a big thankyou .
103943,"Very good engineer .

Quick efficient and clean"
115889,"I will try and be as constructive as possible, but its going to be hard. I bought a new Samsung Z-Fold 3. After a couple of week a few pixels wents white leaving a constant spot on the screen. The phone is perfect - Samsung case, zero damage, perfect condition. Goes back to Vodafone who say its my fault and not covered by the 24 month warranty and its going to be £397. I say no and go through the customer service loop now three times, the phone has gone back three times, I have gone through the muppet in resolution management who just insult you with BS and garbage standard empathy training (I actually told the last guy to stop using my first name because it was like a machine gun how many times he used it - I don't know you, your talking garbage, you don't know me!!). Anyway, this has taken 4 months so far, I still don't have a working phone - which by the way, I only had to get because Vodafone stopped supporting the sure signal devices. Now i'm told that I have to wait another 14 days whilst it goes for another review.

So, i'm paying my contract, plus for a phone that I cannot use and the guy offers me £150 towards me paying the repair bill for a device that is faulty and they refuse to fix under warranty.

Disgraceful customer service, still no resolution, robotic customer service and no working device for months."
174807,Good service and delivery at a decent cost.
115751,"Great experience, smooth from start to finish."
134973,"Quick delivery.
Communication great.
Actual delivery of item was quick and efficient and delivered to room I specified. Care taken with entering property so not to cause any damage. Highly recommend."
112163,I have been with Three for 15+ years and it's always such a nightmare when it comes to contract renewal. I always find a better deal on a 3rd party website and most of the time they match it. But this year all they've done is lie to me for 5 days about manager call backs and weather they can or cannot match the deal. Finally got them to match a deal after 6 phone calls (none of which was a manager). It's a shame their customer service is so p*ss poor because the phone service itself is really good.

154067,"Taking money out of my bank that I never agreed to. They do not have an email address, so that when you contact them you do not have a record of correspondence with them.

I received my phone and it was in the exact same condition I sent it off in."

117447,"Ordered headphones from their website and have been waiting for dispatch for a week now with no way of getting in touch other than slow email replies. Will never use them again for anything as we also had a bad broadband experience with them I’m shocked at the service.

To add to this review - they say there is live chat available on their website but whenever you click on it it says live chat is ""busy"". I got in touch via email today asking for updates on delivery time to hear back with them saying it will be EVEN LONGER than the original ETA. So I then check their website just to find that the headphones are actually in stock so why on earth haven't they sent mine? I get back in touch about this and then they FINALLY dispatch them only because I have told them that their product is in stock?! Also it was sent with Parcelforce 24 hour delivery but is due to arrive on Monday which is well over 24 hours and I needed them to arrive tomorrow before my holiday. If they had sent them 2 weeks ago I wouldn't have this problen."

178988,"The worse company ever.

Overpriced, constant issue with broadband connection. Finally left to go to community fiber (who are excellent).

I thought I had seen the end of them and yet they continue to charge me on a direct debit (despite leaving months ago) and a fee for not returning the box (which i did and had a receipt for doing)."

Paid for the 24 hour sports extra pass and it expired after about 15 hours so couldn't use it to watch something i wanted it for. A few weeks back i did the same , paid for the 24 hour pass and it wouldn't activate after it had charged my card. Joke of a service and will never use it again, stay away money grabbers."

105292,"Whilst the service from the employees and the fairly easy to navigate website were helpful, I fail to understand why after purchasing a thrustmaster steering wheel, only just over a month ago, it produces a fault with the shifting padde. When going into the store I collected it from to simply swap it for a new one, I was then told I can't do that and in fact have to apply for it online. Wait to book a slot to have it collected and then wait a further 14 days for a decision to be made. How is any of this process, efficient, helpful or good for the environment? If anyone could explain how this process benefits anyone I would be keen to hear them out. So now as a result I am without use of a product that is faulty through no fault of my own and I've wasted my own time and fuel to be told that I have to go through this long winded process to simply swap my item for a working one."
133834,"What went right is probably the question to ask!! Order phone (including SIM), realised I had ordered wrong handset, spoke to someone about 10 mins of placing order but order had already gone through to despatch so couldn't be cancelled. Anyway they organised a return (bit of a nuisance but my mistake in 1st place, so all good so far), this is where it goes wrong. Received email 10 days later saying return had been sorted and contract cancelled. Well it would see it hadn't and got charged by vodafone in Dec, spoke to MPD who said so sorry yes it had now been cancelled and refund would be issued, come Jan got charged again by vodafone - spoken to 4 different people so far who have told me different things (including we are refunding what you have been charged and yes definitely the contract has been cancelled with vodafone). Finally got given the phone number linked to the SIM i never received (that was after 3 phones calls to them) and got put through to vodafone (2 months later) who said no the contract hadn't been cancelled by MPD but they would do it now and refund what had been charged as they could see I had never used the SIM."
123740,"Been with BT for 4 years on a full package (TV, phone, broadband). In the past 4 weeks devices are randomly dropping off the internet connection, including a 3 week old phone, a 4 yo Kindle, 6 mo Ring security and my Diabetes management software. The only way to reconnect them is about twice a week I have to turn the router off and do a factory reset then reconnect the devices manually. Explained it's a security risk as I can't rely on Ring and a serious health risk when not able to use my Diabetes management devices / software - BT's answer - you can pay for a better router and upgrade to the most expensive broadband package so you have a better chance of keeping connection.
If they would have offered to replace the 4 yo router for free I probably would have stayed with them on the full package for another 4 years or so, but I'm off to another provider as for any BT issue their suggested fix seems to be that the customer needs to pay more, despite paying them over £5000 while I've been a customer"
188332,"Same day service, So slick and very efficient"
155499,"Item should have been there before Christmas given last order dates. It arrived after Christmas. It was a Christmas present and was no good to me being received after Christmas. It took me about 3 hours making up the album. Time wasted. I ordered in good time before last order date. Snapfish were aware of Royal Mail strike dates so had set last order dates earlier this Christmas.

Also, when it finally arrived late, each page had a line down it. Faulty printer.

A disgrace of an experience to be honest and I had a lot to listen to as my wife's (surprise) present was not available to her on Christmas day. The date given for delivery was Wed 21st Dec. It didn't arrive then and it was too late for me to get an alternative elsewhere. Why give last order dates when the deliveries won't be met?

Caused a lot of stressand anxiety. I doubt if I will ever purchase from Snapfish again. If I could give 0 stars, I would."

146672,"I contacted carphone warehouse as i wished for my account to be closed down and wiped from the database plus to put an end to the marketing emails im still recieving.

My contract was bought out in march 2020 due to covid 19 and my new supplier took over everything however as its due to end the emails are still coming to my email address.

I spoke to one sales advisor and he sent a message across to customer services, placed in a queue and was informed of wait times.

The customer service advisor couldnt pick my name up properly or read the message that was sent to her. I had to re explain these details several times and still no further forward!!

Since her incompetence filled me with anxiety at the fact that two simple, queries can be actioned, i asked to speak to her supervisor or line manager. I was then put on hold for a further ten minutes and an automated message came through to discuss repairs!!

So i called the customer service number again..... I spoke to another sales advisor thankfully he helped me out due to his ten year experience of being an advisor although he was still unsure of a few questions i wanted answered. I was then made aware that customer services is in south africa!!! Not even in the uk!!!! So baring in mind these questions i had were to do with uk gdpr rules and regulations she wouldnt have a clue anyways!!! All she could say was go online and do it yourself.... How can i when these are queries for you to do as you have the systems to make the changes happen but nope!!!

Thankfully im no longer a customer of carphone warehouse however basic customer service cannot be handled and objectioned handled properly!!!

Avoid at all costs!!!"

On hold for an hour and being pushed from one dept to another, keep being put into the same automated queues, all customer services reps completely rude, not listening and frankly making it obvious they don't care. Not even waiting for me to finish before saying please hold and transferring me. Sound like it's run by teenagers I'm a non UK call centre. Complete incompetence. What's the point of an extended warranty if you can even get through to the dept? How do I complain of nobody is available to listen to my complaints?"

Been with them for years to be treated like a jerk is not on, asked for a manager 9 times placed on hold for 45 mins and had my chain pulled, then the woman is complaining to her team as she didn't mute her mic when I'm ment to be on hold called all-sorts that's not able to be posted! fault still remains, now on hold to loyalty team for canceling utterly disgusting"

155464,"The product and ordering were as expected, good. The delivery service provided by parcel force was awful.
May be the review should be about parcel force but unfortunately I am reviewing the whole experience. Parcel force delivered 2 days late on a next day and lied, first time said there was no one in when we have serviced offices with a reception, 2nd time said the address was inaccurate which is funny how they apparently found it the 1st & 3rd time. Wex are great but I would consider using another company next time as their appointed courier is unreliable."

I returned the item on 13th Jan via Royal Mail tracking 24, it was signed for by them on 14th. As of 31st Jan, I still have not received a refund. This seems to be a common theme with this Mickey Mouse outfit. I raised a charge back with American Express on 23rd Jan so I’ve got my funds back now and AMEX will recoup from them plus charge a fee. Some folk aren’t that lucky

Now the actual product… URGH!! Now I remember why I switched to Cloud Nines in 2015. A company that is constantly having 10/20% discount code clearly is in financial difficulty. In 2022/23 they still do not have a multi temperature function - WTH not ? Is the colour of a set of plates more important than hair condition? NO.

It wasn’t sold to me in that manner nor is that outlined in the contract. It just stated 100gb data.
O2 said that as it has been mis sold I need to take it up with MBD.
I now need to contact mobile phones direct to request they correct my GB to the full permanent 100gb they sold my contract as, or face legal action for mis-selling and breach of contract.

Update -

Not sure how you can reply to responses to reviews so am doing so via an edit.

Sophie,

Thank you for your reply.

Can you please reference the section of the T and C’s that you reference re the bolt on data being explained prior to purchase? I truly can not see it without the T and C’s that I was asked to view and agree as part of my purchase? Once you’ve kindly done this we can go further from there.
Many thanks"

I then called Virgin Media and spoke with Danial Dasuso and who was no help at all, and wouldn't even pass me to anyone else even though I asked to be transferred.

So I will be charged for equipment that Virgin Media isn't able to collect on time disgraceful company."
159862,Returned item for full refund and was only given partial. You still owe me £10 after checking this with my bank.
179677,My first order came and had someone else's message on it can't say how impressed I am they sorted it straight away and sent me instructions on how to order a free set which have now arrived and are perfect. Onky slight problem was wanted ti send them last week and ended up being a bit later

105815,"I can’t even write how many things went wrong with a phone order that should of been so simple. I must of called customer services at least 30 times over a period of 2 weeks. I was nice and friendly to every person I spoke to yet, I got treated like utter s***. My issues never got resolved, I tried to put a complaint in over the phone and was told I had to send via post which I did. I haven’t heard back. Two weeks I was left without a phone which I was advised multiple times to wait 3 days it was on its way, most the time it wasn’t!! 2 weeks and I still don’t have the right phone. I want a response and someone to assist me. I’m not going to drop this and I will be coming to the HQ when covid is over to speak with someone if I don’t get a response. I have never made a complaint before but I will not let a company treat me like this. Don’t have a customer service team if they are going to be this appalling and unhelpful."
173306,"I was going on Christmas holiday so I ordered by phone and assistant was most helpful and patient

I received a text from DPD to say delivery delayed due to inclement weather. As the roads were all clear and no snow in Glasgow.
I telephoned and spoke to Donna and she was exceptionally helpful. She contacted DPD and closely monitored my order which was delivered in 2 parts on consecutive days. Donna kept in touch throughout and it was thanks to her that my ordered was delivered before my departure on holiday
Donna gave me 5 star attention and was a great credit to your Company

173973,"There's a fair amount of time between placing ones order, and getting delivery that's not exactly clear when you place the order.
Further, I ordered two Electriq branded products - and I've got to be honest, both really need some work.

Worst - One underestimates the power consumption by a good 150w in usage.
Manual says *max* 650w -
In reality - It's using 800w - and that's not even full power?
Can't see any way of leaving individual product feedback either."

Delivery was exactly at the date and time stated.
The two delivery guys(see below) were great.
Process of exchange, connection and removal of old cooker was very efficient and tidy.
Scott Freeman and Anthony Dixon were very good and answered all questions in a pleasant manner.
I would definitely use this company again.

185341,"I’ve used Deliveroo for a very long time, but was shocked that they took my money for my recent order but was not delivered.

I have paid for the order - Fact.
No food was delivered - Fact.
So why do I need to pay for something I didn’t receive?

If it was online shopping, it wouldn’t be an issue for me to get a refund.

They used “terms and conditions” as a way to hide behind their delivery problems and refuse compensation.
Deliveroo needs to value their loyal customers, otherwise why should they continue to be loyal to their service?

Unfortunately, I’ve decided to delete my account due to this horrible experience. I don’t see why I need to be loyal to a company that doesn’t care!"
180918,"The TV was dumped in our hall by two rude guys in a hurry. The box was badly damaged and the screen was cracked. We are returning the TV, which seems quite poorly made."

I bought two appliances from them and they were delivered in timely manner on Saturday and I was kept informed all the way through.

172219,"I have been using KnowHow for all of my appliances that I purchase from Curry’s for over 10 years. I previously would have rated them 5* however the 3 most recent experiences I’ve had with them are exasperating. I have currently been on hold for an hour and 25 minutes, the last two calls weren’t much better exceeding 30mins each with no apology. If can imagine it’s likely staffing difficulties however, should they be unable to fulfil the needs of their current customers, it would be responsible to stop selling additional products until they have the staff to manage this. I work 12 hour days therefore do not appreciate having to return home to sit on hold, instead of enjoying the remainder of my evening."
154865,I was just trying to sign up with fiber and TV an some women was just reading at me off a script couldn't answer the basic of questions was just replying with questions that was irrelevant like what's your land line number when I've just moved in 🤦🏻‍♂️

Very good at keeping me updated on the delivery of my order ."
115435,"The delivery driver lied that he was outside and tried to call me, which is untrue, he took a route anywhere around but the road I live on. On top of that I was waiting outside and he was still nowhere to be seen. Then I suddenly get a message it was left on the front porch. We don’t even have a front porch, we live in a basement flat!! Me and my partner searched the entire road and it was nowhere to be seen. No refund, poor communication, it was overall blamed on us even though I was waiting outside for him. No excuse. Uninstalled the app straight away. The drivers never get punished for being thieves, it’s ridiculous. £40 down the drain. It was our monthly treat and that got taken away from us. Regret tipping the driver, which also couldn’t be refunded, absolute joke. Don’t ever bother."
168737,This VST is exactly what I was looking for to amp my guitar. I'm in love with Oranges. Tried some riffs today and the plugin sounds really organic almost like the real thing. Plenty of options and room for customization with the cabinets and mike options.🙂

177055,"Agreed a quote for my immaculate iPhone 12 Pro Max of £515. Sent the phone in to receive a made up response of more than 5 scratches to the device and dust trapped behind the camera lens.
This is 100% an absolute lie. The phone was in immaculate condition when I sent it in and the camera was working faultlessly.
I’ve rejected the revised quote of a ludicrous £170.
I just hope I receive my phone back in the condition that I sent it in and it hasn’t been damaged.
AVOID at all costs! Absolute farse and a waste of time. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.
UPDATE: sold to music magpie. Offered £490 for the phone and took the phone no problem. Cash in my account 2 days after.
THIS COMPANY ARE SCAMMERS"
164901,they fixed my cooker like they do at least once a year

110715,"I ordered a set of straighteners as a christmas present.
Nothing arrived yet. Christmas is over.
I can't track the order on the GHD website as there is nowhere to track it.
I tried calling over 20 times and your phone goes to a message that you are having technical problems.
Even though you took payment immediately - you ""held"" thew order for 2 days before accepting the order for ""security screening""
I looks like you couldn't deliver - so rather than talk to your customers you just turn the phones off and wait for christmas to pass.
Well that doesn't wash
I want my money back now.
I paid you £180 and don't have anyhtingt and I cant trach the order. Yiur tracking number is not recognised by Fastway, Parcelforce, Yodel or any of the other courier services I've tried.
You're a fraud.
I want my money back"
183109,"I sent two Iphone 11s, both had good cases and screen protectors for the two years we'd had them. I even took photos of all sides of the phones in case Mazuma came back telling me they were scratched. Both phones were in pristine condition.

Sure enough I received an email titled Problem with your Order - telling me the original offer of £190 for each phone has been reduced to £60 and £160. Due to multiple scratches on the display (more than 3) for each phone and one phone apparently having dark spots due to dust in the camera lens. We took a lot of photos with these phones just before we upgraded and although we didn't purposefully take photos of white backgrounds, we cant see a single instance of dark spotting. (reading other reviews it seems a common fault, at least according to Mazuma)

I phoned their customer support to see what they had to say and they offered to send photos of the problems, however these have yet to surface.
When I rejected their revised offer, they came back increasing the overall offer to £290 with no explanation as to their reasoning. (scratches healed?)

I used a competitor of theirs last time I did this and got exactly what I expected, it will be a £10 per phone reduction to use them again, but I won't feel like I'm getting ripped off.
I just hope the phones are still in a good condition when they are returned.

Update:
Used a competitor of theirs and got the full amount! The price had dropped by the time Mazuma got my phones back to me, but only lost about £20 total.

Avoid Mazuma they are liars."
194025,"Fast delivery right before Christmas. The website and app are very easy and intuitive to use. Even though I have only printed standard pictures with them before, this time I have created my own personalised desk calendar. The print was exactly as designed and of high quality. Very pleased with their services and would use them again in the future."
137388,Purchased a phone in Carphone Warehouse on Henry Street yesterday which was Monday 15/7/2019. Was looked after by a woman called Ailish(hopefully I've got her name spelled right) extremely helpful member of staff very professional welcoming mannerly etc. Would highly recommend anybody looking for help choosing a phone or even a bill pay plan to definitely drop into the Henry Street branch beside arnotts and the Skechers shop facing Debenhams at the ilac and ask for Ailish. As far as I am aware these staff members get comission and this particular staf member worth every penny
139791,U excepted me I was only trying was not expecting you to give me the phone I wanted thank you
162825,I really enjoy using the Virgin media service I find the catch up very useful. When I have contacted you the staff are always extremely helpful and friendly. Keep up the great work.
165441,"I went into the Salford branch, where two members of staff from carphone warehouse or looking at women on their phones. I picked a phone and I was told it wasn't in stock but I had to pay for it now and pick it up tomorrow. I left the shop and got a call from someone saying they had already bought a similar phone. I went back into the shop the next day and said I want my money back. I haven't even received the item, a man called Manny was extremely rude and somewhat racist towards me, to be nice to an Asian lady who was stood before me and looked me up and down like I was white trash.

You told me that terms and conditions stated you are not able to get a refund,after arguing the point out that I hadn't actually received the phone no did I agree to any terms and conditions I wanted a full refund. I left the phone in the shop and called up carphone warehouse over 11 times, no one helped. I was promised a call back from the area manager and haven't received that. I will never be using carphone warehouse and I certainly won't be going into Currys PC world because they support is horrendous organisation and behaviour from staff members."
199631,"Very good
My child hasn't put it down since
Well with the money
Definitely looks like a new phone"
186880,"After calling to report an issue with my appliance the whole process has been seemless. The customer service representatives on the phone have been helpful and polite. Emails have been dealt with very quickly. Two repair guys came in quick succession, and when it was confirmed that the machine needed to be replaced the process to choose a replacement, get it delivered and installed has been very quick and easy. All the workmen who attended my home have been very pleasant, helpful and respectful. They also informed me of the expected time of arrival and stuck to it. I have had a good experience."
163080,"This was a while ago now but still can’t believe this happened... We called customer service regarding my mothers account to help with the internet that was constantly dropping off. When calling they declined that it was, refused to help at all and was so very rude it was unbelievable! With one member of staff, I said something along the lines of “honestly mate it does drops off” and they reply “I’m not your mate, don’t you dare call me that and I’m not helping you with something that’s working fine” (it wasn’t fine). They then of course refused to provide their name and hung up on us... the next person to answer wasn’t as rude but still failed to help (did not call the next day as promised). After constantly calling we eventually got through to someone that sent maintenance over and fixed the issue (maintenance guy was great). All I know is that this was their Newcastle branch in the UK which were rude and unprofessional. Very happy we are no longer with BT, Vodafone’s 4G wifi has been much better and rectified one small issue instantly!"

I was told I would receive confirmation within 48-72hrs, this was last Thurs (over a week ago). Of course this never happened and now they won't honour it (even though I have the full chat transcript).

In addition (as is the case for many scamming companies) I can upgrade online but there is no option for downgrading! Absolute joke."

195853,"I was very skeptical in finding a company that would build me a pc for my specific needs to do video editing, it would have been very easy to just walk into a tech store and get one of the shelf, but you tend to pay more than what you need
After some searching on the internet I came across these guys, there web site is easy to navigate which allows you to build your own or one of the shelf, you can tune in to the exact specifications that you need which was great and the choice is vast a bit daunting at first but they will help you with that so don't panic
There was a waiting time but they keep you informed all the way along the build which wasn't to long, you are getting something tailormade to your requirements so the wait is worth it
A year later they sent me an email to see if everything was going well with the pc, I had some issues with it running a bit slow which was nothing to do with them instead it was to do with some software I had installed, the software company got me to change a lot of the pc settings which then caused a conflict and I am not tech savvy and neither was the software company which was a call center, this went on for about 6 months, I had, had enough so I uninstalled it
The service that I received from PC specialist was first class, they got it back up and running as it should be, very friendly and you felt like you mattered as it should be, you cant beat quality it is something we all feel that is important to us, I would recommend these guys if you are looking for a good well built PC"

It is supposed to take 14 - 28 days, i get constantly fobbed off and am now still £419 out of pocket. I have contacted them about 15 times now have jumped through every hoop they asked and I am still waiting and still chasing. They were escalating it to the banking department as to why I have not received by cheque now they still don't get back to me. I will tell everyone I know to avoid them at all costs. I am getting very worried they are trying to withold my money.....angry and still chasing it.....UPDATE.....3 days later........Still chasing and they are again contacting banking department and i have to again contact them in 72hrs! Absolute Joke"
136528,Found what I wanted easily and received part very quickly. Great service
132926,"Absolutely atrocious customer and client service - they will blame issues on the restaurant even when evidence is clearly provided proving it is Deliveroo's fault. They will thus only refund their service charges (which are too much, but still). They will refuse to respond in anything other than generic customer service textbook responses, and will never pass you on to someone more senior to highlight a genuine technical fault. I tried four different customer service advisors and nobody was willing to acknowledge I had a real problem and/or explain/admit how their technology allowed it to happen. While I can understand people still using Deliveroo, because they have a monopoly on certain restaurants, I would urge everyone to boycott their services if at all possible. I would urge restaurants to sign up with different delivery services. With Deliveroo, if you have any issues whatsoever, you're stuffed. It's not about the money at this point (I refused my refund) - it's about wanting to be treated like a human being and not a computer."

150285,"Additional info following Vodafone reply:
I have decided to leave Vodafone as the coverage is terrible. I went back to carphone warehouse and they processed a change from Vodafone to ID mobile. The staff member printed off the Vodafone guidance which was to call them on 191 to request a PAC code which I then enter on IDs website to get my service transferred.
Only Vodafone have cut me off so I can't claim them. Late last night I had a text saying I had to call 191. I can't. I'm cut off.
So I contact the afore-mentioned social media team by message who eventually reply and tell me to.text for a PAC code.
I can't do that.either as I'm cut off.

I've messaged this info back to them and they are ignoring me.

THIS IS WHY I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN VODAFONE A SECOND CHANCE. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTANT, THEY GIVE CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS AND THEN THEY IGNORE YOU.

DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT GO TO VODAFONE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME.

I'm still.waiting for a response. I'm still cut off. I can't work. I doubt they care.

Didn't even want to give 1 star tbh as they are awful. Got persuaded to switch to them and wish I hadn't.
I currently have no service at all so I can't work.
Tech team slow and spout jargon at you which makes no sense and makes me feel they have no idea.
If not fixed by tomorrow I will be quitting the contract and going back to o2 or ee.
Please please avoid. I was told they'd improved but they haven't. Worse than before if that's possible"

132168,"I've been with BT broadband for over 20 years, but on recently seeing an advert from Vodaphone for the same package for £12 less I decided to transfer to them. However BT emailed me on receiving instructions that I was leaving. After filling in all the necessary forms online I booked a broadband transfer to Vodaphone for 4 November. They sent emails to verify the new contract with them. I then received an email from BT saying I'm leaving on 5 October, a month before my contract runs out with them and a month before the Vodaphone connection date. When I contacted Vodaphone they said that the order had got stuck and has been cancelled, I will need to apply again. BT are saying that is the date they were given by Vodaphone. Due to Vodaphone's incompetence I have decided to stay with BT, who incidentally have matched Vodaphone's price."
122713,Terrible Service & constant lies. This has been on going from the 16th Dec. All I wanted was Broadband after moving into my new home! The previous occupier had broadband so you would think this would be straight forward? They came out so I took the day off work and guess what he said there was a problem and off he went to the box miles away. when he came back and said it would be on in a couple of hours! Nope no broadband. Came back again on the 7th Jan said it was fixed and nope not on. This is getting ridiculous now. Lots of phone calls in between and lots of empty promises and plenty of lies. Beware!! I'm trapped as nobody else can provide so I'm stuck with them.

It WAS working but now isn't and I am not the only one having this experience and it is not the first time. Webmail works but in Outlook I can receive but not send. BT say it is not them - but they always do don't they? Having spoken to our tech support (at a cost) they tell me it is a problem with authentication and the BT servers. I have spent HOURS trying to sort this out and all BT can say is we don't know anything about Outlook. I am about to move my email address after many years of being a loyal customer. I don't want to - any answer BT? I will never darken your doors again and would advise anyone else to do the same. You have one last chance to pull this one out of the bag and restore my faith.

171146,"Absolutely appalling service beyond belief. This is the FIRST and LAST time i'll ever use Carphone Warehouse.

I've ordered an IPhone 12 sim free (£800), the money was accepted and received, the order was processed and due to be delivered. 2 Days after the expected delivery date i had not heard anything so i contacted them via online chat, to be told my order has been cancelled and i need to contact them to find out why... So i then email them with all my information, to then receive an email explaining they need my billing address to be able to help with my query (although my address was clearly stated), i then hadn't heard back so i decided to call them. I spoke to a very blunt member of staff (Ulanda) who wouldn't say anything more than ""sorry you've failed an internal security check"" and apparently no supervisors are available to help. I tried to get clarity as to what's happened as this is the first time using their service all i've done is gone onto their website, paid in full for a product, received confirmation that the order has been processed await for a dispatch notice, then not heard anything.. once again all she could tell me was i've failed an internal security check... 0 Customer Service, not even the slightest bit of understanding as to where i was coming from. I can not believe a company as big as this is able to exist, how and why would you completely refuse right of service to a first time customer who's paid in full via card...Utterly Shocking will i even get a refund??."

108003,"Complete rubbish. I have the now tv stick and had to bring it back to the shop because the remote wont turn off the stick. The second one won't turn off the stick either but according to now tv the power button on the remote is for turning off and on your TV. So now when the stick goes into sleep it takes ages for it wake and today was the last straw , while watching a movie I went to pause and the remote would not work. The only way to get the stick back working was to unplug it so now the film had to be restarted but no not that simple the stick completely froze. It took nearly 20 minutes for the stick to work again. As soon as my 2 month pass is ended I will never have anything to do with Now Tv again. Just Google problems with the now tv stick and there are loads of people getting issues with them. Worst device I have ever purchased."

Call again today & they say YET AGAIN ""It'll be 1-2 weeks"" & they physically can't get any more information so I'll give it one more week I guess before cancelling. What's irritating is I sent back an S22 Ultra to get this plan with them so other places have the stock...

And because I 'failed' to provide an 'optional' order number, here it is MPD086589406. I'm afraid I haven't received a message Rachel?

2nd update 22/09:
I've just had a reply from their customer service team suggesting delivery will be ... any guesses? Correct! 1-2 weeks!! What an absolute waste of time this company has been. Never actually did receive a follow up message Rachel...

Text message Monday your Oder is cancelled, so I spent 30min on the phone to find out it was cancelled by mistake and they without my permission just reordered it for another day which I couldn’t collect!!!!
So for the second time they cancelled it and I went to a shop to get one instead only to be told I couldn’t get one as my order had not been cancelled; so lied to by the customer service.
I then had no option but to go direct to EE and for a small amount extra I had a new phone ready to go in 20mins with the same deal!!!!
Today I find that the Carphone Warehouse have takes the money for the twice cancelled contract and an email saying it will be up to 14 days to get it back!!!!
AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!
Finally to add insult to injury another week later and I must call them to get a refund as the auto repayment system failed. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!"

On delivery day we were phoned to say the delivery van was parked outside at the front of the building on a narrow road with double yellow lines. We had left delivery instructions when ordering the appliance regarding the car park at the back of the building (it should have been a very straightforward delivery) and we explained this again while the delivery men were outside, expecting them to turn the corner and park on the rear car park there. Instead they just drove off without explanation. We were then told by the store that they didn’t know where our appliance was and there were no more in stock. We were told it would be a week and a half but it is now over two weeks since we placed our order and have not yet heard when our replacement is expected."

162991,"A month ago I decided to change the landline and internet. When I searched online I came across Talktalk at a good price and service. I changed it but my previous provider insisted and offered me a good deal. I cancelled Talktalk within two days. However, I have received my first bill of £31 even nothing to do with their service fee etc. I have returned their broadband modem which came 3 weeks later. They had time not to send it in the first place.
I do not like such big companies that do not have a well-trained staff who cares about what the consumer needs and wants and completes a simple cancellation without any pain.
I regretted contacting talk talk. I regretted hearing this company name. Now I cannot contact any of them. They will ask for my password, and phone number which I deleted as I have never used it and as I cancelled it.
What kind of business what kind of country we are becoming? I need to finish a project now. But I have to deal with the fault of the incompetent staff!

114768,Correct spare delivered on time at a fair price
185466,"Disappointed.
I was looking for a set of replacement brushes for a Hoover washing machine motor and my search returned a pair from eSpares which were an equivalent after market part. Thinking I preferred the original item I searched further and eSpares showed me the oem part. The page offered one for £15.53 or buy two for £20.63 each and thinking that one was a set as in the previous page I ordered one for next day delivery. On receipt I found that this was only a single brush which was surprising - if you want a pair of shoes do you order two shoes?
I contacted eSpares through their feedback and received an email saying they would be in touch within 48hours but was not contacted. I then received an email saying thanks for getting in touch we are sorry the part did not fit please get in touch.
I contacted eSpares through the chat line quoting the ticket number and the first response I got was to ask for the ticket number. I then pointed out that the web page was not clear and that if it had been I would have ordered two despite the strange pricing. eSpares did not see anything odd about the pricing which by then had been changed and when I pointed this out I was told they would not do that.
I sent a screen shot of the original page but the chat line assistant was unable to see the difference until I pointed it out. The response was we must have changed our promotion.
Overall the web page was misleading and can't have been checked, the chat line assistant flaky and the general service poor. I have now returned the brush and I am waiting on a refund.
The whole experience was a waste of time and far more trouble that expected. I would not recommend eSpares."

107821,"My Broadband contract with BT has just expired. I had their ""Halo' product, which is not worth extra expense. The Tech support was non-existent, when I went to use it I was advise that it was for 'set up' help only. The mini hub they send out if service goes down, took 3 days to arrive, so I was still off line for 3 days. Looked for a BT package outside of their 'Halo' range and been advise that if I want to stay with BT I must choose a 'Halo' product which are more expensive.

My advice is steer clear of any of their 'Halo' BT Broadband packages, as you will not be able to leave them easily with leaving BT and starting again, during which time you will lose your email address.

Look forward to BT's response on this. Already escalated to CEO's office"

142387,"In general I have no issues with argos as a company. Its my local store that let's the company down. I went yesterday to order an item. I spent 5 minutes being ignored by several staff members before being served. I was the only one in the store waiting at the time.

Then today I went back to collect my item. I was served by a lovely lady at the till, but the rest of her colleagues let the store down.

There was 4 argos employees stood in the middle of the store, blocking the main exit causing shoppers to have to divert around them, talking and laughing like they were in the pub on a friday night. One of the 4 had an extremely loud, and obnoxious laugh that made it difficult for me to hear what the lady at the till was saying and in general was very irritating.

This is a reoccurring situation every time I've order from this argos."

It takes hours to get through on the phone and 3 times I have got through to someone and despite getting to the point of renewing the contract, 3 times they have cut me off before the renewal has been completed. On one occasion I was transferred to a Team Knowhow employee and was left on the line for over an hour and a half with nobody taking the call. At one point I was speaking to someone called Ben who confidently advised that if I was cut off, he would call me back. This was weeks ago and I am still waiting! I have also attempted to email and to date have not received a response. I have been a loyal customer for 8 years and the current customer service has been appalling."

When we originally signed up, we had a landline.
During 2022, we were told,we are now going fibre optic.

I thought this may mean, we no longer need a phone line,wrong!

No, i still have to pay for one even though i have no phone, just a line i think? who uses landlines now!

I received a letter,to advise that our monthly payment will now be £59.00 instead of 54.00 a month.

No, i checked BT have been charging us a whopping £74.00 for a phone line,that is not used. Internet with Norton security.

Our daughter is paying less than us, she has been with them for only 10 months.

Why we need to change our security provider from McAfee to Norton?. which was not straightforward unsurprisingly.

Luckily my daughter was at home to resolve the issues i had installing! technical support was virtually non existent!

I will try to go on BT chat today!
Please wish me luck!"

198872,"Ordered an alpha sync pc, was much higher quality compared to typical pre-builds with actual good quality components used.

Very competitively priced even compared to building a similar myself to avoid the labour costs.

Arrived next day with zero issues.

Would 100% buy another alphasync pre build in the future - especially considering it would’ve only cost me £20 less at the time of purchasing to build the same PC myself - so absolutely worth the money to avoid the stress of building myself."
151293,"Background: I bought a Denon surround sound system 6 years ago (a really positive experience). However, the gentleman who sold the system upsold me an extended warranty (6 Year Chargeable Guarantee).

Normally, I never take an extended warranty, but the sales person wasn't pushy and explained that if I didn't use it I could come back and get my money back after 6 years. So rather sceptically I took the warranty and in an unusual fit of organisation put a reminder in a calendar and stored the receipt safely.

Fast forward 6 years and it's time to reclaim my warranty money. First I checked online as I cynically thought they might have removed this deal, but no it's still available. So I set off to the Sheffield store expecting this to be a complete nightmare to sort out (paperwork to fill in, all kinds of blockers to getting a refund).

I was wrong, I showed my receipt to the sales advisor (David I believe) within two minutes I had the cost refunded to my card.

I'm not sure why I thought this wouldn't be straightforward, every interaction I've ever had with Richer Sounds has been positive.

Thank you Richer Sounds, it's been a while since bought anything from you but it is great to see your customer service levels remain exceptionally high and when I'm next in the market for AV kit you will be my first port of call."

Dust that hasn't show up in a single photo I have ever taken. I disputed this but frankly they don't care.

Also they say there is 100% NO WAY AT ALL that the damage was their side. The phone was fully packed, boxed and bubble wrapped, mint condition when it left. But they refuse to accept there is even a chance they could be responsible. Joke.

Adele - a customer service manager - was just rude and unhelpful. The apathy in her voice was palpable.

Ive used them before and they have been good but frankly the attitude and the fact they have no staff (admitted by Adele) and seemingly a dishonest approach makes them one to avoid."
136877,Very good service from Jonno and Mark G good lads
122049,Always Happy With The Easy To Order System & The Time It Takes For My Order To Be Dispatched Thank You
179319,"Horrendously bad. 4 weeks now of being fobbed off regarding our wifi connection, once you leave the room where the router is situated, its completely useless. Tried to cancel, they want a disconnectin fee. Told them i am cancelling direct debit, i will not be paying any charges as the broadband is the worst connection i have ever had. Customer service are cluless, rude, and disconnect you if they dint like what you have to say. AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
177067,"Recently called the customer service as the HBO movie package doesn’t not satisfy me, always showing old movies and nothing interesting.
I’m loyal customer that has been using their services for years, and they were all nice and helpful when I had to renew my contract few months ago. But they are liars, I asked to change movie package as HBO is so poor content and to switch to FOX movie package, they refused even it’s the same price! They don’t care client satisfaction, they just pretend to be nice when you have to renew contract then you are rubbish for them. AVOID"

130415,"Great website. Great range of products. Great communication with customers
Both orders I have placed with you, delivery has been by 1st Class Mail.
At this time I consider myself lucky to receive one delivery per week from Royal Mail (They have blamed Covid for all their lack of service. That amounts to Royal Mail saying that over 80% of their staff is off with / isolating after a test, from Covid !??).
I know this may be temporary, but it is a nuisance."
147986,"Team knowhow dont know how to deal with customers
I bought a washing machine in November and was told its out of stock so didnt receive my delivery on the day they promised.
In december my father passed away overseas and i was struck with the biggest grief of my life.
Anyway i dont know where my receipt is but i have many messages on my phone asking me about my experience.
Well all i want to say is if currys and pc world needed charity they should have asked me. But the way things stand this isnt charity but its theft.
Team knowhow dont know how
To lookafter customers.

By the way i bought this washing machine for my newly wed son and daughter in law

Name on receipt for delivery was

111592,"I got a contract on Friday through Carphone Warehouse for a Vodafone contract, I was told the network would be connected within 2 hours, it is now Tuesday and I am still not connected. I have been into store and told it was because of weekend and to wait, contacted store by phone and got nowhere with incompetent manager. I have contacted Vodafone who say they have no record of Carphone Warehouse requesting this connection. What are we supposed to do just sit and wait until they decide to do something. I also took out insurance and I have been trying to cancel this as I am not paying insurance on a phone I cannot use, but I was never given any policy documents and so I do not have a policy number to cancel."
176101,Quick and easy online process to book an appointment for that week. Engineer was polite and explained in full what he was doing. Problem rectified quickly and machine was working again at end of appointment.
147181,I got a fire cube but couldn't even turn it on because all the power cable was for another device completely so it's just sat in my cupboard
153384,My elderly relatives landline developed an external fault and they had no service as a result for around a week. This is their main means of communication with the outside world. I sent 2 emails explaining this and if I had waited would no doubt still be waiting! I thought I would try through Twitter DM. This proved more successful but drawn out. I would suggest using Shell's contact number. My elderly relative borrowed a mobile phone but gave up after 45mins waiting but I would suggest hanging on. Via Twitter it took several days. Customer Service staff were pleasant and responsive within these limitations. Once Openreach were engaged the issue was resolved in 24hrs. Meagre compensation for all the hassle. Under £5!
125430,my only complaint is on in ordered out of stock not your problem except you are messured by epson poor performance

107168,"Gave top marks for cooker install on earlier review even though we went a week and a half without one because the first cooker arrived faulty.
We were told to send in receipts for meals and takeaways as we had no cooking facilities and a disabled child with dietary needs and Knowhow would look at reimbursement.
Phoned up after cooker was finally installed to sort it and was only offered £30. I explained about being told to send in receipts as we were told that we should be allowed staple meals. Receipts came to £250, we were very honest as we didn’t claim for all that we spent and I told them I would accept £200.
Emailed receipts a week ago, now being totally ignored. I get the impression their customer service people just tell the customers what they want to hear. I will be calling them this afternoon and unless I get satisfaction I will be looking at the small claims court and I’ll be looking for the whole £250."
141448,Great service! we ordered online which was simple and straight forward and our goods arrived promptly and we were able to track delivery. Notifications on delivery time received which is always helpful.
161259,"The purchasing was very easy, In choosing A supplier I look for an email contact as well as the customary telephone, this they had. Price was good. The delivery was as planned and easy to track. I will use Hughes as my first port of call for the future."
190132,"You’ve more chance escaping from the crystal maze than you do escaping your BT contract!

My contract ended 26th July, I rang up 2nd of July requesting a cancellation, nothing was done, my account wasn’t even noted. I rang up on the 19th requesting a cancellation, again, nothing was done, at least they noted my account this time… A new bill was issued for £35 27th July, rang for a third time to cancel on the 27th. Low and behold, ‘oh we can’t action that cancellation until the 3rd August, so you’ll be charged from now until then’. Naaaaaaaaah, don’t think so like 👍🏻

Instead of constantly trying the hard sell of your sub-par products, how about you just do what your ‘valued’ customers request.

Don’t waste your time with these bandits. It’s a big market out there, do your research and choose wisely with a provider that doesn’t try to rob you."

198925,I have nt received my order and I didn’t get a reply to my online query about the non receipt of the goods.
184228,Your service is excellent. The only thing I could say is that delivery was a little slow but that was probably with it being Xmas and postal strikes

Impressive guys, keep it up!"
153946,"Ordered a spec built gaming computer for Xmas present.
The help and information I received from both pc specialists and its forum members was brilliant.
All questions were dealt with by customer service and made me feel at ease.
Delivery time was slightly slow but had to take into account it was Xmas.
The only negative I would say is if your paying full amount for a product then I expect it to Start being built straight away not having to wait 3 weeks before it is even in the build stage.
But can highly recommend pc specialists, as long as you allow plenty of time for build."

161107,I needed my laptop checked over because I spilt some drink on the keyboard so I got it checked out by team knowhow in which it has taken 2 weeks for them to check it over which was quite reasonable during COV-19 situation but I would warn people that it takes 2hrs at least to call up customer service and to also warn people that to backup your laptops as they wipe your computer but it does state it on the terms of service they do wipe computers which unfortunately I lost my data but hay at least hopefully i won't have any problems in the future fingers crossed and plus something else I don't want to crap on the company but i feel you need to stop excessive intakes which could be effecting your staff with too much work which could cause problems with overworked staff or even worse destroying customers appliances because you want to rush fixes but finally looking at reviews with customers having things going missing or appliances not working properly and so on could link to my past comment overworked and excessive intakes. This is thr one last thing i am going to say because i feel this should be said i would recommend getting your repairs done when COV-19 situation is finished and everything goes back to normal because i feel its too much for any company to handle

The software on the now TV stick is faulty. It reduces the bit rate when the Internet connection is poor, such as when someone else is downloading something. However it fails to increase the bit rate once it improves, so the only way to improve the picture again is to turn the stick on and off again.Customer service is not interested."

143999,5th November engineer failed to turn up to sort out continuous faults with WI-FI. Today 8th November actually received text saying engineer on his way will be with you soon. 2 hours later still no engineer. Tracked fault & message said it had been fixed.. it hadn’t! He hadn’t even been to my property! Spoke to C.S. who contacted the engineer team directly & they said they had phoned me & I had cancelled.. all lies! I hadn’t either received a call or cancelled.. why would I when I still have the fault. £25 added onto my account for missed appointment. (BT must be losing a fortune due to no show engineers). Another appointment made for Thursday obviously I’m SO sceptical.. probably be another no show. In sheer desperation I have agreed to have full fibre installed which means increasing my monthly bills but this appointment was meant to be a temporary fix until that happens. If full fibre doesn’t fix all Wi-Fi issues I shall be going to the ombudsman. Wasted so much time & lost money when I should have been speaking to clients instead of hanging on the phone to BT! Not at all happy

173448,"Do not go for an upgrade. Carphone Warehouse stitch you up. I upgraded to a S20+ with a promise of a £135 trade in and £200 extra bonus. I paid £445 upfront but thought what the hell, I will get back most of the upfront cost. Carphone then reckoned my phone wasn't working as it had a crack on the back. It was working. They sent the phone back to me even though I accepted a lesser value because of the crack. However they sent the phone back to me in error and have now denied they had the £200 extra on top of trade in offer. Apparently this is common practice for Carphone Warehouse. They do it all the time and most people can't be bothered to complain. I have complained but they ignore my messages and then fob me off with lies and excuses. Seriously, there are so many other options out there. Just don't shop at Carphone Warehouse."

I also phoned them as I was having money taken off my debit card for Now TV which I have never had I have a fire stick,
I phoned to ask about this and they would not discuss anything with me as my broad band was registered under a different debit card and address to mine,, so because I phoned up to ask what was going on because I never knew the debit card or the address it was registered to they would not discuss the problem
A few day later they cut my broadband off, when I phoned to ask why,? they still would not discuss it unless I gave the credit card number and address its registered to although they could see the installation is at my address????, eventurly I managed to get someone to sort my account on line only to find the card they were applying from did not let them take any money, found the card details on line and still don't know who's it is, the reason I got disconnected with because they didn't receive payment from the card they had registered so I had to pay over £60 in charges through no fault of mjne,

5 months old and the iPad suffers a hardware failure. We asked for replacement and was told it has to go to the team knowhow who will just send it back to apple for replacement anyway. (which was confirmed by pc world tech guy). The manager of the store was unhelpful and did not care, telling me he had a tablet and he could not have it replaced even though he worked there.

When I signed up they said it would only be a few days till it’s live- made it sound really easy.Had an email saying the date it would be active. 2 weeks later, nothing. Keep phoning them and they keep saying the same thing about how they’ve escalated it. Now they’re saying if I cancel it would delay signing up to another company.

I ordered through Topcashback as mobilephonesdirect had a £65 cashback offer on, the cashback tracked at £35 and they have not replyed as to why i have not received the full amount. This is false advertising.

Worse still a week later the contract i took was offered at a much lower cost in the black friday sales. Happens but still they should offer a reinbursment in a short timeframe before a sale."

Well done and please continue like this"
177547,"Appalling service. Now been without a landline for many weeks and no sign of BT taking any action whatsoever to get it fixed. They ignore every complaint, ignore every request for information by essentially saying ""it's out of our hands and its with Openreach"" but just remember guys you own Openreach so how about working together rather than passing the buck. No one from consumer or business side of BT teams can be bothered to get in touch or take any initiative to solve an ongoing problem. Truly the very worst of British business it has ever been my misfortune to experience."

Cant believe it happened again, they obviously choose to lie on their website as everything shows 'in stock' - avoid

Update - spoke to customer services yesterday was told that website was incorrectly showing ‘awaiting stock’ and that in fact there was stock and my order would be processed yesterday, checked this morning still showing pending out of stock"

Very good cooperation and detailed answers to questions! Thank you my friend 🙏"
113859,"Wow! I can't believe carphone warehouse have that many poor reviews but are failing to act on them.

I purchased a cheap little pay as you go which comes with £10 top up that I ofcourse paid for, however when I recieved the one, it became evident that I was definitely charged for the up but carphone warehouse failed to give me any form of voucher number so that I could use it.

Thankfully, EE were very helpful and they took this in their head and added the top up anyway. This saved me allot of head ache from having to contact carphone warehouse (who from looking on here seem like they couldn't give two hoots anyway) to try and sort this out.

Thanks EE, keep it up and carphone warehouse, show us that you care by responding to this comment. I look forward to you offering me a resolution for your error."

130748,"My daughters MacBook stopped working, phoned Apple, out of warranty sorry, take it back to PC world. PC world, said ok but you need to wait till someone from Teamknow gets in touch. A week went by, I chased them up, to be told that they would pick it. Another week went by another phone call, told don’t worry we’ll be in touch. Another week went by, to be told you need to take back to PC world. They take it away to be looked at at a cost of £60. Another 2 weeks go by, finally told that it’s corroded inside going to cost at least £763 to fix, I didn’t go down that route. No problem we’ll deliver it back to you I’m told. Today I get a call from a nice lady to say I think I have your laptop. She lives 25 miles away, a 50 mile round trip to pick it up. Delivered to completely the wrong address, total incompetence. 2 trips to the store 30 miles, 4 phone calls, 5 weeks waiting, sent to the wrong address another 50 miles travelled. Very poor service."
129847,"Called to report a fault on my washing machine on the 19th December. I tried to book a repair online but the website wouldn't allow me so I waited around 20 minutes on the phone. Booked an engineers visit for the 23rd December, but later I got another text message that the engineer has been rebooked for the 30th December.

Engineer came and said my machine needs some parts replaced. Since then I have had no communication whatsoever from D & G. I called up, and after another long wait was told that the parts were ordered and I will get a text when the engineer is coming.

It is almost 3 weeks since I first reported the claim. I am NOT happy with the service being provided. If things take long, the least you can do is communicate with me and let me know! I wish I would never have taken out a policy and paid for the repairs myself. At least I would get what I'd pay for rather than being left hanging for at least 3 weeks and who knows how much longer?"
137849,"Sent off a perfectly good working phone that i had checked prior to sending off to them to ensure I was sending an excellent condition phone, as i had selected this on the selling page. I have never sold a phone via this site or company before so was unsure what to expect. The price i was given was good so I proceeded with the sale, i got an email yesterday with a revised price due to various things the had picked up, please bare in mind I had already had my phone checked over by a specialist company who confirmed a couple of small scratches on the screen and nothing like the information they sent me via email so i quickly rejected the offer and I await my phone being returned. I took photographs of my phone prior to sending them my handset with a date and time stamp on it so I will hopefully have it returned in the same condition. It seems the company likes to exaggerate and make false statements to reduce the price they offer which is absolutely shocking and I will certainly never use this company or recommend them to anyone due to my experience. Absolutely shocking and one way to get an expensive phone at dirt cheap prices. If my phone is returned damaged like a lot of peoples seem to be I will be taking it a lot further as I have my time/date stamped photographs along with the mobile phone specialists report to confirm phone and camera is in good working order along with my phone being in tact etc.. overall, awful experience regarding the price offer being changed etc and I will certainly never use this company ever again."

As usual my only quibble is the fact that each game you order has a £1.95 postage fee which means 4 games cost £7.80 in postage. This is really expensive.

Be warned."
189319,"I understand that companies need to attract new customers, but it is not right to offer a lower price to new customers while charging existing customers a higher price for the same services when the contract ends. This is a clear case of price discrimination, and it is not acceptable.

They offered me only one option and they think this is a kind of service.

I am very unhappy with Virgin Media's pricing and services. I do not recommend Virgin Media to anyone, and I will be switching to a different provider as soon as possible."
121246,"I think they have OK service/network. I wouldn't recommend, do not take out if you are in rented property and requiring to move, ie evicted as landlord wants more money. You will pay massive amounts for having to end contract early. No leniency due to circumstances!"
135096,"yeah they are not worth signing up for the free trial.
luckily I had checked my statement or I wouldn't have noticed them taking the 15 euro out.

very sharp practise. I thought I had cancelled every pass but I hadn't and was charged for two months unaware. the person on customer service was very nice and he cancelled my bank card details.
don't sign up..."

198888,"I had an oven fire recently and trying to get through to KnowHow has been awful. Over an hour wait (understand this is because of C19), the advisor answered the call, put me on hold and accidently hung up, another hour on hold for the same thing to happen! Did another hour on hold and eventually got through and advisor helped me.
The engineer that came out was very helpful and polite I cannot fault them. I then had a text about the repair saying you had tried to contact me (you hadn't) and to call back. Spend another hour on hold for the advisor to put me on hold and hang up AGAIN! Finally got through after another hour and booked an appointment for Monday. I have now received another call to say the engineer is unavailable on Monday and you won't be able to come out until the Friday... So that will be 2+ weeks without a cooker! I paid for insurance to make sure I was able to have a cooker available to feed my family. Can you please explain why I am paying each month for this shocking customer service?!
We're all having a difficult time due to covid but this is inexcusable for a company that 'prides' itself on good service. I shall be waiting for this fix and taking out a different insurance !"
173603,Prompt delivery of a part that matched the description exactly.
118475,"Great personal service - knowledgeable staff who were not pushy , but wanted you to enjoy the experience and were there to guide you and answer questions to help make your decision.
You can also try the kit a so a much better way to try before you buy
I had taken the kids - the staff set them up in the cinema room to watch some trailers while I browsed - a very unhurried experience. So much better then the electronics /audio superstores!"
192547,Excellent service from beginning to end. Kept abreast of progress and delivered promptly. 3rd machine I've bought from PC Specialist and won't be the last.
102419,"Shamble’s of a company can only complain by phone or post. Try to get them to answer the phone, what a joke of a company raise a fault then go to track it and there is no record of the fault. Service is getting worse and that’s hard to believe as it’s been terrible for years
Don’t let them put you on digital voice as it’s terrible and and won’t work"
107056,Order was never delivered and I never received a refund

106433,"** another update** been without washing machine for over a month now and still no voucher blaming Covid for delays.....

** update** took a day off work today for repair to take place, called to say part hasn’t arrived and rebook for next week. I can’t take another day off work. Requested a write off voucher as it’s over the 2 weeks repair or replace, but hear this is likely to be refused as timescale is not relevant apparantly.... another hour on hold wasted...

DO NOT USE

Without a washing machine, blaming COVID for the delay so will not replace. What the hell do we pay for? Takes over an hour to speak to anyone and book a visit. Terrible company and wish I had avoided.

173269,"On placing my order late Saturday afternoon, my appliance was delivered Monday afternoon.

108406,"5 weeks so far without internet, 13 hours on the phone, two engineers came out (don't have any routers or any other equipment with them) and still no internet. 4 times we were told we would get a call back as their system was down, never called.

By far the worst customer service out there. Just pay the little bit extra for a company that doesn't take an hour before you're actually discussing your problem. Everyone beyond incompetent."
187605,"The customer service is very confused and transfers you from one representative to another and after a 5 change they don’t respond to you. My contract ended, I wanted to find a new deal and they were not able to offer anything. Wanted to charge me double on the same broadband. I would give 0 starts."
184026,"I ordered it on the 26th January. They said they would deliver on the 28th, which they did,"

176808,"To begin with, there are two positive reviews on this page. The rest is all negative and there is more than five bad reviews.
3 is a terrible company who doesn’t want to help anybody! We are still dealing with the same issue! No one wants to assist with us matter! We are definitely cancelling on August 23rd! Not worth the money! Plus, the internet doesn’t work all the time either! 3 owes us about a month worth of payment for the service not working for an entire month! Anikita don’t waste you time sending a reply! You ppl need US not the other way around! You should be calling us to service your customers and not telling us to call you!I am so exhausted with this back and forth and nothing gets resolved."
185475,"I ordered a calendar and I have received a calendar for another family, my frustration is that there is no way of contacting Optimalprint to let them know!!

165257,"The Rise isn’t great. It arrived 2 weeks late and all it does is catch my hair in the bristles and leave a frizzy mess. I spent hours on it and in the end gave up and put the straighteners through it. I wish I could get my money back, but will have to chalk it up to experience."

136566,"I paid for this soft toy online but when I collected it I noticed what appeared to be a small burn hole in it. I immediately asked the staff at the counter if they could swap it for another, but I was told they wouldn't know where to locate it on the shelves. I was then advised to join another queue to get a refund and then place a new order. What a lot of faff!!!! I ordered online to save time but in the end I spent 15+ minutes waiting around for the refund and new order to be processed."
168806,so my first time with mobile phones direct didn’t start of so well….my application was successful and my phone was sent out..11/10/22 on the same day they recalled the phone back apparently 3 network didn’t connect and was told my application was to close..5 days after i received a letter from 3 welcoming me obviously they did connect my phone that i didn’t receive..after calling and emailing to see what was happening ANDY from customer services was the most amazing person ever and got quick onto my case and gave me the best news yesterday that finally my phone is on its way 😍 excellent customer service off this guy wish they was all like him! 5 stars just for you! and thank you once again
169347,Took a computer in for slow running problem. They had it for 2 days and I had to chase them for a status update. The only work done was to run the clean-up software which didn't improve things. They managed to take out my knowhow cloud backup so I had to reinstall it. All in all a waste of £60.
110154,Easy and rapid contact with technical to evaluate problem on phone. Quick return & refund for excess parts supplied
152980,"Awesome website, easy to get quotes from multiple vendors. All in the one place and gives you the ability to read reviews which helps choosing a vendor. I am delighted with the website and its services and plan to use it again."

102812,The cooker I ordered was delivered when they said it would.
124317,I was unsure about what exactly to get in a PC so I used their jargon free quote and when I had an issue I had an online chat with Liam and he was very helpful and informative and made the whole process a breeze.
143566,"The main issue with curry’s is that their customer service is in South Africa. If nothing goes wrong it’s all good, but once you have a problem they simply don’t have the necessary resources to resolve. There’s an advantage to buying from the store rather than online, you can physically return a faulty item. No escalation process to handle complaints effectively."
104107,Very pleased with the service and quality of product. My fridge arrived before time and delivered to me in excellent condition 👌.
130450,Very happy with the custom laptop. Perfect for work and home. Very easy to order.

Not only was our account cancelled 2 days before we moved from our old house our go live date was 2nd September and we are still waiting to be connected!! Evidently open reaches issue but now tv haven't even bothered to help or follow up! We have made complaint after complaint and still they are not bothered!! open reach has now cancelled our connection again with no explanation as to why, AND EVERY! NOW TV customer service person has completely not bothered to help!! we can't speak to a MANAGER (what manager?!) we can't even get through to complaints and now we are told despite being given several go live dates that have never happened we wont recieve the £5 a day compensation we were told we woukd get!! Its costing us a bomb in extra data as i work from home and am having to hotspot via my phone!!!!! Because they are saying we were never given a go live date even though we were !!! Don't use them !! They don't comment on any of these complaints on here for a reason . ..because there really are not bothered at all!!!"
190592,"I wish there was a score of 0 I could gibe!! Absolutely disgusted!!!
Been with 3 for over 10 years and decided to switch to a cheaper provider with better signal (not hard there!) Checked with the 3 app which said I could cancel and to request a PAC code to keep my number. I did this and received two texts from 3 stated if I used the PAC code today then my bill would be £0 so I did. Que receiving a bill with an early cancellation fee on it for ending my contract 2 weeks early (this was not clear to me). Call 3 and they say the message wouldn't have stated about the bill being £0 and asked me to email the proof team. I did this and was advised I'd hear in a week. A fortnight later I chased it to be told I needed to speak on live chat. Today I spoke with the rudest and most unhelpful person who kept typing the same sentence saying I didn't give notice, fees can't be waivered. It didn't matter how many times I explained that 3 had already said using the code to change provider on the day I did would mean my bill was £0 and contract cancelled, he just kept copy and pasting the same sentence. He then just said ""is there anything else I can help with"" and I said that I wanted this to be escalated and reviewed by management because I'm not happy, my message was ignored for 10 mins and then he kicked me off the chat!!! I have put in a complaint, 3 keep harassing me for this £24 and the only way they will let me speak with someone..... live chat!!! I'm fuming!! You can't tell a customer that ending their contract today would leave their final bill and £0 and then just start charging!!!"
165886,"Love our new dishwasher, great communication, great delivery."
151762,Driver's took great care with good s delivered and took all packaging away
175900,"Have made many purchases from PCSpecialist what I get is always top quality well made and have never had a machine that didn't work perfectly straight off.

This is because all machines go through individual testing before dispatch.

I have made purchases on behalf of family as well as for myself. I would strongly recommend."
142438,quickly delivered . . .no.probs!
129877,Right product good prices and quick delivery
184404,Very poor customer service. An item went faulty just out of warranty. An engineer informed me it was a manufacturers fault and under sale of goods act the retailer should still fix it. Very didn’t want to know and don’t even have an email address to contact them on. I was informed because I hadn’t been on my account they had deleted the order so there is nothing they can do. Looks like you’d have to take them to small claims court to get them to do their legal obligations.
124355,"Ordered some photos and they didn't arrive, asked for them to be sent again and they still haven't arrived"
101863,Prompt delivery to a chosen destination
198100,Great service after my air ram had developed a fault with the fan motor.
165591,"Too too long to be kept waiting on the phone listening to ""we are experiencing a busy time....."" Over & over again, enough to drive a sane person mad. How about employing more call centre staff if you're so busy that you can't answer a call within a couple of minutes ?"
125344,"UPDATE

I have been emailed asking my to change my review now that the item has arrived after waiting almost 3 weeks. So here goes........

Item has now arrived and doesn't work. It's 5 days before Xmas and I need to raise a ticket to speak to someone as they have no customer service to talk to directly. I'm guessing that I will not be receiving a working product in time to give to my son for Xmas !

Ordered the item over 2 weeks ago. Still not here and the service has been terrible. No updates, even when I ask"
173677,"Absolutely first class service, totally recommend this company"
187739,Engineer did not call to say he was coming. My husband was attending a cow that was calving and thus not in when said engineer arrived. When I called the engineer he was extremely rude at which point I explained what’s happening and he then moaned again saying he would “turn and come back”. He did attend and rectified the problem with the fridge freezer. But honestly the engineer needs to improve his attitude! It’s a good job I was at the doctors with my granddaughter!
191947,well lets see if you answer emails in your reviews as you stopped replying to mine when you stole my daughters £329.99 are you going to give her money back or like a million others keeping it to line your pockets
148168,"I never write bad reviews as I don't have time & prefer to be positive. However, felt compelled to warn people not to buy NowTV internet package. Where do I start? What a stressful 3 days & still no TV. My husband changed from Sky (where I was perfectly happy) & where an engineer fixed everything up in 30 mins. I wish he had read the reviews & not left Sky, to save money. The stress is not worth the savings!
We have spent days going around in circles with no Customer Services/Engineers to ask. Just bought a NOW TV STICK & cannot enter the code to activate. Printer would not recognise NOW TV & had to get work IT services to help, lost connection to work email, no TV the list is endless. Do not touch this company with a barge poll!"
135398,Vodafone UK has zero service quality! Not recommended at all.
118364,Initially helpful advice on the telephone. The parts ordered fixed the problem perfectly and were delivered very quickly.

147914,"Tons and tons of fake job ads. Bark must make up these ads to take our money. When I'm out of credits loads of jobs in my criteria come in then when I buy credits, jobs just trickle in.
It's all a complete scam to rip off people who are trying to earn an honest living."
152524,"I am a loyal customer of Deliveroo for many years.

An hour ago, I ordered some food from Stick N Sushi for 50+ pounds. I put down the wrong address and I noticed immediately and I tried to contact the rider. The rider didn't pick up any of my calls. I also messaged him to ask if he could deliver to the correct address. He said that he is unable to come. We told him we will come immediately and we asked if he could leave the food at the reception. He ignored our request and waited until time was out (obligatory 5mins waiting time) and took the food and left. He also did not tell us that he was just going to take the food away for himself, although we told him to please leave it at the door or at the reception and that we were on our way to pick up the food. We arrived 3 minutes after he had left and there was no food because he didn't leave it but took it away with him.

I asked on the Deliveroo portal and they said that the rider should leave the food at the reception if there is one. Only if there isn't a safe place to leave it at, then it would be returned to the restaurant. We also called the restaurant, and they said that no rider came to return any undelivered food.

We should be charged for the delivery if the rider ignored our request to leave the food at the reception and simply did not respond to our messages and left with the food. This is absolutely ridiculous as we began requesting this immediately after he had arrived and the reception is 10 metres away so I am sure he had enough time (5 whole minutes) to walk 10 metres to drop it off at the reception. We even ringed the reception to notify them of a Deliveroo delivery. Yet, we did not see anything at the door or at the reception. It is truly unfair and ridiculous that we have to pay when he could simply leave the food at the reception which we have requested, and he had ignored. Please see attached photo evidence of us arriving at the door and our Uber receipts for going all the way over to collect the food only to find that he had not left the food (because he ignored our message and refuse to leave. Not because there is no safe place to leave it or we didn't request this).

Please give me a satisfying resolution for this matter. Thief!!!!! 🐍🐍🐍"
113542,"Been with Talk Talk for years now .

199180,Safe and quick delivery. Works perfectly fine
197259,"Ordered an item on the premise that it would take up to 10 days to receive. 12 days later and item still awaiting dispatch. Emailed to find out how long it would be . Several emails , several phone calls later . Still no idea of where when item was to be expected. ' hopefully' was one term . Royal mail dispute was another reason , even though it hadn't been dispatched and then later finding out that Evri was the courier service . They were raising a dispute with Evri on my behalf , item still hadn't been dispatched so how was the fault with Evri ? . Asked for item to be next day delivery, was told that service wasn't offered ? Evri offers that service?? . Was told that the service was good because "" he had put me through to relevant department and his other two colleagues hadn't ' . ""Putting me "" through was filling in a form to request a cancellation on item ( would take 7 days to process) . So even though item hadn't been dispatched, they'd had my money ( nearly £300) for 14 days it was still going to take 7 days ?? . Item the arrived !!!!! I'd cancelled so had spent another £300 elsewhere to get the item, Studio still have my money , several e mails now to get item collected and then up to 2 weeks for item to be processed and refund started ???? What a joke!!!!!!!!"
177734,"It was about time to donate my 8 year old PC Specialist PC (which still runs flawlessly with 0 maintenance, just an updated gpu) to the small person in the house and bring myself up to date.

From the time of ordering the PC it was built, tested and signed off ready to be shipped in 2 days. The very fast building option is something I'd always pay for. Whilst building your own PC isn't particularly difficult, the time you spend hunting down the right parts for the right price and then having to test them to check they work/sending back defective products ends up costing you more than having someone skilled to do it for you.

The system I recieved is perfect, cable managed so well that I didn't want to interfere with it to put in my gpu that I had already purchased separately!

This system is whisper quiet in comparison to my old unit, runs incredibly cool even though I chose an older case etc.

Great service, great turnaround time, great product. Will continue to use PC Specialist and recommend them to friends and family"

137579,"I'm sure this company sell phone very professionally. However if you do as I did cancel the order before it is shipped, as they couldn't give a delivery date don't expect your money back quickly....if at all. Ordered phone 15th April and by 4th May couldn't give me a date. Decided to cancel. Agreed date to credit given 8th July. They missed that and have now given 30th July. I appreciate that these are difficult times but I managed to order a replace at £10 more and it came next day. I have now decided to raise a disputed payment claim with my card provider as I have no faith in this company Wish me luck in getting my money.
Success!!!! After going to the Small Claims Court they paid up.
I also took a number of other measures but I put getting my money back down to the Small Claims Court. It is an easy process all on line and very quick.
If you have ordered and not been shipped in the advised time then cancel. I would suggest waiting for at least one of QMF's deadlines to be missed and then log a claim www. gov.uk/ make-court-claim-for-money"

177843,"I recently moved two accounts for Broadband service from BT to Shell Energy Broadband, and I sincerely wish I had never done so! The ""Go Live"" date for both properties was 17 November but the Shell Router at both properties would not connect to the internet. There was no communication from Shell, and it was virtually impossible to get through to them on the phone. When I did get through, I was told that one property had ""not gone live"" and I was put on hold for the agent to speak to the technical dept. After being on hold for over 50 minutes the line disconnected and no one called me back. I sent an email and was called back the next day and told there ""Was a crossed-line fault"" on both properties and I needed an Openreach Engineer to come to visit both properties. Before Shell would send an Openreach Engineer I had to agree to new terms and conditions which involved potential additional charges to rectify these ""faults."" I was subjected to considerable pressure on the phone to agree to schedule these visits and agreeing to pay these potential charges. I refused to do this and wrote to complain about the abysmal service and being pressured to pay an open-ended amount of money. I have changed Internet providers previously at both of these properties and never ever had any problems before like this. The seamless transfer to Shell Energy has proved anything but seamless! I am a 75-year-old who is not technically adept but I managed to get a friend to connect the Shell router to the inner socket of the existing BT Openreach socket behind the outer plate, inside the properties of the houses. There was no ""crossed line fault"" at either property and I was put under unfair and unreasonable pressure to agree to pay for Engineer visits for a fault that did not exist. So I managed to eventually get both the routers to work, but no thanks to Shell. I would add that the Shell Energy router is substantially inferior to the BT router and in my experience is not fit for purpose. The router signal is weak and it does not work upstairs at the property. The agent to whom I spoke at Shell Energy said I was not the first to complain about the quality of the router! Do not expect your experience with Shell Energy Broadband to be simple or easy and if I could rate Shell Energy Broadband as zero stars I would! AVOID!!"
179731,"As it stands I'd currently give deliveroo zero stars. My order didn't turn up, was stuck on ""rider is on their way"" for over an hour couldn't track them.

106661,"When it comes to delivery Team Knowhow did know how! As we had both are fridge freezer and 6 month old washing machine break down within a few days of each other, and both were written off, we had to order new appliances. We had our new fridge freezer delivered by Colin and Ash on Thursday and new washing machine delivered Bobbi and Anthony of the Wednesbury branch today. All four of these delivery men were very friendly and helpful, and a credit to Team Knowhow. It was much better than my previous experience with Team Knowhow."
169140,They are about as good as a chocolate tea pot. My partner has been working at home for over two years with no problems but the the last few months his system keeps crashing and now he had to go into the office as it is impossible for him to work at home at all. We are paying a lot of money every month for nothing except a large headache. At least he can go into work but if you ran your own business then it could cost you your livelihood. We probably just need a new router. When trying to speak to a person a lot of them just hang up on you or if you do manage a full conversation than nothing happens anyway. I would not even give then a star!

YES...another year and STILL NO FIBRE.... infact, strike that virtually nothing here but basic 1.3mg...if neighbours are not on at the same time !!! BT , say OPENREACH responsible for connections.... and we go round and round............(see you next year).......!!"
107284,"If it weren't so pathetic, it would be funny. If BT get around to reading my review, I'd like to let them know that it's no use asking me to contact them via Facebook or Twitter, because I don't ""do"" social media.
That said, my experience with the company, (after being a customer for forty years) has been laughable.
We were recommended a BT fibre broadband package by our ISP, which is EE, and connection was arranged for 28th November. We moved our living room furniture, as instructed, for the installation which was scheduled for between 8.00 and 13.00 and could take up to three hours. No engineer appeared and having notified BT by email, I received an apology and a reschedule for Friday last, 2nd December. This time, an engineer did call, but told me that it wasn't possible for the installation to go ahead as the cable had to be connected from a pole on the other side of the road and also because of the ""obstacle"" of a small half-roof which overhangs our ground floor and would mean he wouldn't be able to use his ladder safely.
Why didn't someone from BT check these facts out beforehand? They would only need to go on to Google street view to notice the roof, and presumably they have a record somewhere that our lines are overhead ones.
The following day, I had another text asking me to go online and make another appointment for an engineer !!!
Yes, right!"
186732,Parts I needed were easy to find. Easy to order. Reasonable price. Fast delivery

184424,"Great customer service, and awesome price for a warranty plan"
130611,"Reference: 751084 I have brought my TV to repair on the 7 of August. Haven't heard anything from them, so after 3 weeks I went to the shop to ask whats going on. I've been told that my TV is written of and a voucher has been sent to the wrong email address, even though I have provided my new email to them. The actual people working in curry's had sent several emails with the updated details; however no one from the team has been bothered to respond. It has been nearly two month now and its absolutely ridiculous. I have also been trying to call the team and see what is happening however no one responds and when they do they do not seem to be interested in helping to solve the issue and instead just hang up. Honestly the worst customer service. They try to get people to buy insurance but once its needed they don't really care. Do not recommend team KnowHow."
120887,"I use Tanya batteries for all our battery needs, they are fast, reliable and very cost effective."
192228,"Used the online customer service to ask for advice on which sim I should get, bought it, and when I tried to swap my existing number to the new sim, was told I could not do so for whatever reason - so I was wrongly advised from the beginning from that advisor. Told me I couldn't get a refund for about 2 hours after being passed on to multiple people, but luckily the last advisor said i could because i bought it off amazon. Wasted 2 hours just to get this response.

Second issue, i had to provide my existing number to do the swap and ever since then, Three has been calling me to sell stuff. SO STOP CALLING!"
133542,"The tactics used by virgin media to get you to pay for a 18 or 24 month subscription are underhand snd unscrupulous. You are made to reply to an email within 14 days or you are forced to stay and pay £48 a month for broadband only, no phone or TV services. The broadband itself can be ok but I've found it to deliver poor quality speeds quite often. Or it simply drops out. When it is fully working it can deliver speeds of up to 139mps which is fast. But despite that. I got a better level of service and a better quality of speed from sky. The learning lesson behind this review is; Don't strong arm people into paying for broadband services. Treat your customers with respect and they will stay with you because they want to. Not because you've threatened them and have to. With the cost of living crisis biting saving every penny is the order of the day."
147902,"Not a terrible service but not the best. Money did arrive eventually and customer care contacts were amazing and really helpful. I sent off 3 orders and not a single one was payed the same day as it was received so that is false, one of the orders was delivered Thursday and due to not getting done on the Friday I then didn’t get it sorted till Tuesday due to the bank hol which really wasn’t great. So ultimately really good service but please don’t count on the cash the same day because it’s not going to happen."
117961,The Parts Centre? there are several companies with the same title ! Which one are you and what did I order without this information how can I answer your question ?
130939,Quick delivery. Accurate description of 2nd hand items.
154697,Great service from the best TV & Audio company out there
137553,I found the Agent I spoke to in regards to my query very helpful and friendly and she put my mind at ease straight away.
106403,"I had a very good experience with the website, ease of use and communication from you was excellent.
The delivery was spot on with a call from the just before arrival.

However, one small thing (which could have been a much bigger problem)...I chose the unpack and recycle option. Which was fine. But i feel the delivery guys could have removed the shipping bolts when they unpacked the machine. I didn't know they existed and once i got it set up, went to the instructions for how to do the first wash.
The machine almost bounced out my house and my daughter thought a helicopter had landed in the roof!!!
Very slight damage to the side of the machine, and my kitchen units.
A quick call to my dad solved the problem, but now knowing they exist and the reason for them, i would have expected the delivery people to remove them as part of the unpacking."
163731,"I bought a phone for £680 in 2019. They didn’t send it for roughly two months and whilst communicating with them they kept reminding me I can ask for a refund …. So eventually I did. They gave like three different dates of when they will give the refund by and keep using covid as an excuse. January 2022 and I still have not received my refund.

I have used quick mobile fix twice before til his experience but they have suddenly become fraud/scammers since 2019 onwards.

Avoid at all costs!"

168470,"I rang Shell on Thursday and got through to Katarzyna G.N to sort out a number of issues. She was patient, polite, clear, thorough and very helpful. She managed to sort out issues with closed accounts in my name within a very short amount of time and I didn't get this standard of customer service from anyone else. She stayed on the phone for over two hours and rang me back to ensure everything was okay. Katarzyna is a credit to Shell and they should give her a raise and use her to train up their other agents!"

166947,"DO NOT USE
i sent in my phone and was honest about the condition (aside from one crack on the back it works perfectly)
was quoted £260. they then contacted to offer me £55 in which i declined and opted to have it sent back to me. i have just received it and it’s COVERED in deep thick scratches in which they have purposely done. it was immaculate bar the crack when i sent it
i’m taking legal action against then for damaging something that is not theirs. i previously used sell my cell and was hesitant to use elsewhere. always stick to way you know. do not waste your time or money"
158396,"Last night we ordered food via Deliveroo- when the delivery man arrived at our our address he called my mobile and demanded that I go to his car to pick up the food. i simply responded that this is a block of flats and deliveroo always come inside the building to drop off the food. he still shouted and demanded that I had to go to his car to pick up the food and that he doesn’t work for me.

Finally, I convinced him to get out of his car and enter the building. When he arrived he shouted again and said “he does not work for me and he does what he wants….”. I was in sheer disbelief that this is the service I’m receiving for placing an order. Then, I raised this complaint online but nothing was done and the help-line just simply said that it will be passed on.

I am so sorry and disappointed that deliveroo is providing services via people with thug-like behaviour, so aggressive, rude and scary.

He was so out-of-order and loud that our neighbour heard and ask why we allowed such people in the building. Of course we then said it was Deliveroo…..

I must say that after this encounter I will look into another food delivery company and will join them. It is so dangerous that this company have hired people like this….. it is simply unsafe to have such people know people's address and have their food delivered….

I will submit this complaint to any other platform so people will be careful of deliverloo and not to trust their food to be delivered by rude thugs."
120837,"This was one of those really good experiences. The ordering process was easy and the delivery arranged. I was kept very well informed of progress and the delivery team turned up bang on time. They were helpful, professional and very efficient. The freezer was put in place and all set up. Very well done all round."
106340,"Ordered a poster print of multiple photos with express delivery. The photo quality was ok, however the centre photo did not include the single subject (her head was cut off🙈), which was not the case in my submitted photo.

Additionally it arrived a day late & the refund for the late delivery was laboriously quibbled via online chat.

Won’t use them again"

118886,"I went into Currys Winnall Winchester yesterday. Saw a 28 inch LG smart tv on display. £169. Decided to buy it. Turned out the display tv was the only one of that model left. Said I would take it. Much huffing and puffing as it was disconnected. No box available and no Instruction packet. Asked if discount was possible in the circumstances. Firm No given by Manager. Such was the disinterested service finally decided not to buy it even though I liked the tv. At home I looked online. Argos had the same tv, brand new and fully boxed for £149. Picked it up less than 24 hours later Sainsbury’s Badger Farm. Very pleasant assistant. Where would you shop in future? Would give 0 stars if possible."
114085,Adrian from the Sales Team used his iniative to help me with a customer service issue. I really appreciated his his attention and efforts
186407,I've had a few items from this company over the years. This time I bought a halogen. I paid for the 24hr delivery and it arrived on time. Their items are as described and are always well priced.
188541,"For the second time we had problems with our GTech Hylite. However, as before, I got through to customer service very quickly and the lady I spoke to was most helpful. I received a replacement for the faulty part on the following day."

102292,"The men who came were fab and can't fault them at all. However, was told they would be here at 8.15am and then they were nearly 10am when they came. I rang and called and queried the slot as I'd planned my day around it so it was frustrating that the slot wasn't stuck to. I was told I'd be the first job of the day!"
159619,"My item did not reach DPD but after online chat to query it was received the following day. Excellent customer service, thank you!"
112723,"I ordered a refurbished iPhone 7 on the 18th April 2020, it is now the 12th of May and i haven't received any update on the progress of my purchase or received my iPhone even though it should of been dispatched 7-10 days after my order."
163103,"If I could give 0 stars I would! Did the free trial and I cancelled on the 7th day - I screen shot as I just had the feeling that it wasn’t going to be simple. I was correct, they earmarked 9.99 for the following month and also 3.00 boost?!?! Lord knows where that came from! I was not aware that I selected a boost neither was it clear if I had that it would be a further 3.00!!! If it had I would not have selected.....whatever I supposedly selected! The online account is so confusing and you just cannot close down the account at all! Start up a chat which I got kicked out of twice, replied to an email with a screen shot to prove I cancelled on the 7th day and therefore should not have been charged for anything however the email that I replied to doesn’t accept emails!!! They are infuriating....do not use! Now I will be going direct with my bank to dispute the charges and will provide them with my screen shot"
152307,"I ordered a phone on 01st August 2020 and was advised of a dispatch timescale of 7-10 working days. After 10 days I contacted Quick Mobile Fix and was assured of delivery by the end of the week. Then every week after that I received the same broken promises. After waiting 6 weeks I requested a refund but am still waiting for my money back, It’s now nearly 8 weeks with no phone or refund. PLEASE DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!"
133716,Never been so unimpressed with customer service. My cobalt blue straighteners were sent in for repair and I was informed I would be contacted if they couldn’t be fixed and a like for like replacement would be sent out. Not only did they not contact me but they also sent me bright pink straighteners which weren’t engraved like my originals. I would never have chosen this colour and when I contacted them about this they told me they would not change them but they would engrave them (after I refused their ‘freebies’). Extremely unhappy with the fact they won’t replace them for a colour that is actually likeable and that I’ve had to argue for 30 minutes just to get the engraving that should have already been on there. Would not purchase again as if they break you don’t get something you would have actually willingly brought.
179911,"I have been waiting nearly 12 months for the promised volt benefits of next level broadband upgrade, double data on my O2 device and the very much needed wifi boosters (the router is very poor) advertised at the time I took out my contract.
Numerous attempts have been made by me to rectify this. Including contacting the overseas call centre. My latest attempt, last night resulted in me spending 2 hours on the phone, and being told I would have to pay an extra £6 per month to get the benefits I was already promised and was/is still advertised and which I am legally entitled to at no additional charge!
My message to ‘everyone’ who calls there terrible helpline.. ending 111 in this situation is, ‘get very comfortable and have someone on hand to bring you refreshments, it’s going to be a long and frustrating call resulting in you achieving nothing but regrets that you ever dealt with this awful company!
I feel I am left with little option but to take court action over this violation by your company to fulfil its contractual obligations to me….
Please do not reply that this is a 3rd party site and you do not know my details nonsense. Here they are… Please check your system and have someone in the UK call me to resolve this..

Crack through screen..Sent back , another long wait and what felt like 100 phone calls passed from pillar to post..received call to be told could no longer fix my tv as it was an old 3D model. I asked for a new tv as it had gone well past the 14 days ! Told I'd receive an item code to take to my local Currys and I could get a replacement like for like tv. Never received code but did get a call to say I can have a brand new tv Samsung 50 inch, i agreed . Waited and waited and totally messed about with my delivery dates / times , on one occasion never turned up. Finally arrived today! AT LAST .. i watched the men get it out of the lorry and leave it unattended, watched the box fall over in the wind then to be told it wasnt actually new , boxed ripped, plug/wires etc just put in a bag and not packaged up . I am so cross and frustrated ! On the phone yet again for another 50mins.. my little boy will not have a new tv for christmas now I just know it. Please avoid !"

163832,"What an absolute joke of a company
one of the riders was rude and aggressive towards me which resulted in me not getting my order: when I asked the live chat for help they believed the riders excuse about not seeing ID when I had clearly shown him my ID.
I was that scared of the driver I had to lock myself in my flat and he started shouting at me and banging my door, the only reason I didn’t call the police is because I thought I could resolve my issue with the help section on the deliveroo app.
The drivers name is mehmet.
I think it’s disgusting that deliveroo would allow a driver to treat a paying customer that way and then refuse them the refund they are entitled to after being treated that way by a professional."
161404,"After waiting 4 months I discovered that they had cancelled my oven door order.
When I queried why they had no answer but then told me that they now had one in stock.
I therefore reordered it but when it arrived it was only the outer half of the door.
Thankfully I still had the inner half of the door and all the screws so was able to reassemble it.
Poor item descriptions and most items have no photos so you're not quite sure what you're buying.
Not my best online purchasing experience."
184916,"Perfect, had the exact part to replace a faulty fan heating element in Amica oven, would highly recommend *****"
156504,"Cancelled the contract in advance but they failed to this from their end and keep sending me bills for over £100 with added charges for late payment, they have admitted to finding 2 phone calls from myself cancelling the contract but are still trying to charge me. Spent 1 hour 20 minutes on the phone and they offered me a £6.00 reduction for their mistake and I can see from other comments this has happened before. No one seems to know what they are doing and they can't handle phone calls or carry out simple requests and expect me to pay for their mistake. Opened a complaint and this department are even worse, said they couldn't find any phone calls but after speaking to 3 people in one phone call because they are useless 2 of them admitted to finding my phone calls on the system. Such a joke of a company expecting someone to pay £102 for a mistake they have caused."

Tried to speak to someone and the message was we are very busy and may not be able to answer your call today. It's 3-00pm. Absolutely shocking customer service for an awful phone provider"

I need an integrated FF that is 50/50 and A+ rated. When I was offer an integrated FF with no charge it was 50/50 but F rated. If I want like for like I am expected to pay extra!
I’m also disappointed that I have to pay for recycling my old appliance and pay for new to be fitted. Why are these services not covered? I was told like for like, but not told about extra payment for fitting etc. when I took out cover. Very disappointed."

My partner and I rely heavily on the wifi and 5g as we both work from home.
It’s just really absurd that we still expected to pay our monthly bill even though they have done nothing to meet us half way !

So disappointed once our contract is up I will not be using them and I will be changing our phone numbers to another network"
120267,"Got a contract of 2 years with a device,
At store they said my bill would be 20 pounds per month for the SIM plan and 54 for the device.
After 2 years contract expired, they still charged me for the full amount of the device instead only the Plan,

Contacted them, and they said they can't change the contract without our approval,

BUT they can raise the price, but to lower the price they need our authorization?

They made their app and website very hard to find the information about your contract and how much you still need to pay for your device, its almost impossible without recurring to google.

Stay away of this company and its predatory business model
EDIT: As usual trying to milk a bit more from the customer that decided to go.

I’ve worked in customer service for 10 years now and these people have no skills and no shame whatsoever except to lie through the teeth. I am so sick of the excuses they give, short staffed, Covid, empty promises and false delivery timeframes. They should be taken to court and put in prison. They are shameless despicable liars. I begrudge giving them 1 star
UPDATE
After patiently waiting for 2 months for my phone and receiving numerous false promises I told them I was thinking of contacting my bank for help, I received a reply the same day saying that because of this they had cancelled my order and I would have a refund in 14 days. Guess what, no refund. They then said it would be 21st May. I have now raised a dispute with my bank who said they would keep me updated with progress every few days.

Can't sort it after 9pm because noone available to speak too. Absolute sh*tshow of a company. Be quicker sending your messages stuck to a blind donkey than sending an email through BT. And no point in one of their ""advisors"" replying to this. Makes no difference. Contracts up in October and they won't get another penny. Paying for an ornament to sit in the living room and blink.

Customer service chat function is utterly useless. There is no customer service. They have offered me credits so I can go and edit the year at the top of each page. They have been unable to grasp the fact that every single date is incorrect not just the date at the top of each page, and then I have to pay the postage to have them shipped to me. All I want is what I paid for originally. Asked to have my complaint escalated to someone senior only to have the same person offering me the same inadequate solution. Have used Snapfish to make calendars every year for the last 15 years, won’t be using them again."

I sent the phone in for repair/replacement but the company claims I have damaged the phone which is inaccurate and refuses to honour the warranty. Do not rely on the 1-year warranty."

Well after starting my moves to a much better, cheaper plan elsewhere, I get a call from Vodafone in Rotheram asking for the reason I was moving -as soon as I said that the plans were too expensive the guy started disagreeing with me and telling me -we will just leave that there!

115741,"I wanted an unlocked Motorola phone. It looked as though Currys/Carphone warehouse at Burton on Trent had one in stock.
I went on 13th September. I waited for nearly 30 mins. Information was scanty. But I decided to buy. I was asked name, address, dob etc to be entered into the computer. Then the same questions again for a tablet. I was told I needed a charger (cost £17-99). But the bill suggested I’d been charged £19-99. However the bill was not itemised and the salesperson said I could not add up.
When I got home I found plug and charger were included so my purchase of the charger was unnecessary.
I wrote a letter of complaint to Currys (no reply or acknowledgement yet) and returned to the shop a week later. Currys staff, while perfectly pleasant, could not help. I’d have to return (18 mile journey) when the Carphone warehouse till was open. I said I did not require the refund immediately but could he take back the charger and just give me a receipt on paper to show that I had returned it and the rest could be dealt with by letter/phone. This was beyond the capacity of the system
In the hope someone from the firm is reading, the reference number on the diminutive bill is Ref435451860/175450640].

Later. I contacted Mohammed but he may be AI rather than a real person. Believe it or not I am asked to give all the information again that I've given them
already.

4 Oct. I sent a written complaint by post. A few days later I was phoned while out. A message was left but spoken so fast that it was hard to hear who it was from and 5 replays were necessary to catch the phone number and the reference number. I phoned - usual hurdles. Attentive listening (eventually) but no action. I'm still waiting 9 days later

26 Oct I'm still waiting. Do they even know or bother if I have had a refund for the mis-sold charger"

My monitor died on me and so I needed a new one urgently. I placed my order, paid for next day delivery and waited.

On the day of delivery it still hadn't been despatched. No communication from the company as to why this was - I had to go and chase them.

I try not to buy everything from Amazon as we will regret it when other buying options have closed down, but my choices were Amazon or eBuyer. Had I gone with Amazon, I would have my monitor by now but as it is, I am going into the weekend without.

eBuyer - what has happened? Are you wanting all of your customers to shop elsewhere because that is what is happening due to your unreliability.

I was let down last year when I bought something from eBuyer and that wasn't delivered and so I thought they must have improved and so I gave them a second chance. More fool me and there will not be a third chance."

144869,"We have a Knowhow Agreement covering our Samsung Washer Dryer.

On Wednesday 30th September I contacted Knowhow to request someone come out to repair the machine. I was informed this would take seven days, and so the engineer arrived today, Wednesday 7th October.

However, the machine will require a new locking mechanism and the engineer did not have the necessary part. I was told that he would put in an order for the part and, hopefully, it could be fixed this week.

Just received a call from the support team and been told that the next available appointment will be next Wednesday 14th October.

We will have been without a working washing machine for two weeks. The part will not take much more than 24 hours to arrive, so I do not understand the delay.

Clearly a two week delay on a washing machine repair is unacceptable. We took out the cover because this is not a machine we can live without for an extended period.

I was offered the option of complaining by telephone, but I was told that the wait time was currently one and a half hours...

I was also given an email address to send my complaint to but got the following response: ""Your message wasn't delivered due to a permission or security issue. It may have been rejected by a moderator, the address may only accept e-mail from certain senders, or another restriction may be preventing delivery."".

I then tried another email address, found on a letter (dated 22nd July 2020) under a section entitled ""Section H - Get in touch for help and support"", but using this one I got the response: ""This mailbox is no longer active, please visit our contact us page for further information on how to talk to us""

Clearly Team Knowhow want to make it as difficult to contact them, as possible"

151375,"AN UPDATE FOR THE REPLY….
As this seems the only way of communication for my poor service. Both myself and my son have tried to contact your customer services since this review again told it is an intermittent signal issue. Unplugged, restarted and refreshed the router more times than I care to mention and still no reliable internet connection. I’d love to provide my full account number but unfortunately my internet is not working so I can’t even provide you with that at this moment in time.

I am at a complete loss as to what to do with with this matter. So incredibly disappointing…






I really wish I was able to give you zero stars because you genuinely don’t even deserve 1.. let’s start with the broadband speed. Well apparently it was 7 times faster than my previous provider. AN ABSOLUTE LIE!!!!!

Do you know what upsets me the most is that I upgraded to virgin, from vodaphone thought I’d treat my self and my children to quicker wifi, better for my sons studying, my speed for work having to upload and download images etc. what a fool I am not only do I now pay double but I don’t actually have an internet connection at all 9 times out of 10. This is no exaggeration!! your lucky if it work for 10 mins of the day, I’m constant buying more data on my mobile plan to try and accommodate my work needs. This wifi isn’t even strong enough to make your ring doorbell work correctly (the router and the doorbell are on opposite sides of the wall. Couldn’t be closer if I tried). Iv actually sacrificed my home security system (wifi based) in order to help my connection apparently 4 devices is overloading your connection. Baring in mind I’m a single mother of two children security is obviously a big thing for me in this day and age, that on top of holding on to my job by the skin of my teeth because my broadband connection is so unstable. My children’s education is also suffering as a result of this. Unable to use there laptops for studying, my son is trying to revise for his GCSE’s Iv tried ringing customer services on multiple occasions I’m talking 4-5 times a week Iv even been hung up on at 8:59 with no explanation because you close at 9. When you manage to speak with someone mildly helpful nothing changes still no internet connection. I finally rang in absolute tears last week as I had a super important deadline to meet for a new contract and guess what my virgin wifi blew it. Do you know what they told me. What do you want to do?? cancel?? This was apparently a customer relations manager, she was so rude half no empathy for the situation and basically told me that it will be in excess of £180 even though you are in clear breach of contract and I have clear photographic evidence. She couldn’t care less. More interested in taking more of my hard earned money to cancel a service I’m
Not even receiving.. the stress and anxiety you have caused me and my children is diabolical.. PLEASE DO YOUR SELF A FAVOUR AND USE A DIFFERENT PROVIDER FOR YOUR BROADBAND AS THESE GUYS ARE TERRIBLE.. THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND GIVE YOU NOTHING IN RETURN APART FROM A HEACHE AND CRIPPLING ANXIETY… BEWARE DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I HAVE ALONG WITH EVERY OTHER ONE OF THERE BROADBAND CUSTOMERS!"

Later on in my contract I was told that my internet service had been boosted to 100mbps but the fastest I recorded was 48mbps . Even after numerous e mails the service stayed the same. Virgin Media will not talk to you so beware.

172429,"What is the matter with people??? Thanks to United Utilities I've had NO WATER for almost a day! (See my review of Useless Utilities). And as well as dehydration, BT are seemingly in competition with Talk Talk for WORST ISP!

On 13.12.22, I switched from Plusnet to a BT ""Social Tariff."" The service included unlimited broadband, unlimited landline minutes, digital voice, and two new landline handsets! The service was due to start on 29.12.22. Sounds too good to be true?

On 16.12.22, I received a vague text (not email) from BT saying there was a ""problem"" and that my order had been ""cancelled."" No details given at all.

I've spoken to BT several times, and they say there is a problem ""porting"" my landline to digital voice, and that my order is ""stuck"" in the system!

Earlier today, I called BT to cancel the digital voice service, and keep my analogue landline. I spoke to a ""snotty"" young man who insisted on calling me by my first name. I told him it's overly familiar and rude to do so, when you don't know the person. Even though I build computers, he proceeded to talk to me in a very patronising manner, treating me as though I was stupid, even though I'm WAY SMARTER than a call centre operator! He even had the gall to accuse ME of being rude to HIM! ... I'm a 60 year old gentleman of impeccable character and good manners, and I have SOCKS older than this impudent young man!

I ended the call, and called back again to CANCEL the move to BT entirely, and to tell them they're BLACKLISTED along with Talk Talk! They couldn't have been less interested in my complaint!

Disgusted with BT Customer Service!!! And service (or lack thereof) in general!

As one of the biggest names in Telecom, British isn't necessarily best! (See what I did there?)

I will NEVER again buy Telecom Services directly from Buffoon Telecom! They tell me that all analogue phone lines are being moved to digital (which don't work in a power cut!). I told them after this utter fiasco I'm NOT moving to digital, PERIOD! I'll simply discontinue the use of my landline, and make FREE phone calls via Alexa! The problems that digital voice has caused is a joke! It's NOT worth the hassle! Go digital voice and you WILL regret it! Progress? Don't make me laugh!

Really annoyed by RUBBISH SERVICE from both Buffoon Telecom and Useless Utilities, who've BOTH left me ""high and dry!"" (See what I did there, again?)

Really annoyed! ... Merry Christmas? ... Bah, humbug!"
112159,Havnt recieved my order and still waiting....
140800,"Now TV is awful in almost every way.

First off, it's very overpriced for what you get, and you have to spend extra to remove ads and get HD viewing.

Then, the user interface is awful. To watch something you have to find it on the website (which itself is terrible to navigate), and then it sends you to the app.

The app doesn't work on several devices / formats, apparently designed this way to convince you to buy the Now TV box. A lot of time on my laptop, the sound doesn't work, or refuses to go through bluetooth. The streaming quality is bad, the subtitles often don't work, and it goes out of sync often.

Avoid NowTV IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. This is the worst streaming experience out there."

Got a call back today to arrange yet again another repair for next week (Wednesday) no weekend appointments available.

167801,"THE WORST customer experience I’ve had in 32 years on the planet. My original installation was cancelled twice on the day they were planned to come and the day before - they didn’t even call this was just an email. I cancelled to go with another provider but received a call from the retention team offering me a deal to come back. Surprise, this has been cancelled twice again so far because I need “pre-work” at the address. Every time I call to find out when this work will be done then I get passed to 100 different departments to be told they will “send an email to the engineers” then they never get back to you. I just called the pre-installation team and asked them to put me on with a supervisor, they said they were busy. I said I would wait but they said it wasn’t policy and HUNG UP ON ME. So I’ve waited a total of 5 months for an installation and I’m still no closer. Do not recommend this company if you value your time and sanity. Would be 0 starts if I could."
195798,TalkTalk all of a sudden tried to charge me £50 for not returning a router that I bought with my own money. I stopped my direct debit so the charge didn't go out as I wasn't happy to pay it. They told me the charge would be added to the end of my contract but it was on the next monthly bill. I paid my current rate of £27 by card so my account was up to date apart from the magical £50 charge they pulled out their hat. Now they cut me off until I pay the remaining £50 balance. I got in touch with them eventually via chat and told them my concerns and the agent said they will leave a note on my account saying I wasn't happy with the charge. Seems to have fallen on deaf ears when they cut me off. Currently on chat with them to cancel my account.

104568,"Good quality of paper, fast delivery and exactly as the image on the website"
124967,"The staff were helpful, knowledgeable and polite.
Can't ask for much more that !!!!!"
180460,"Order 3 items from Morrisons via Deliveroo, I asked them to cancel the order if any item was missing…..I got 2 items!!!!!"
179582,"The delivery was on time , the personal polite is fine"
102147,"Amazing pc, good contact. Took slightly longer than usual to source parts which is understandable but worth the wait"
193195,"nightmare trying to place order and get hold of them, when my password recognition failed - finally did and told wrong thing first time, had to phone again - finally managed to pay and order - then email turns up and `i think it's gone wrong again - but it hasn't just misleading email - the day before delivery , courier contact me to say cant deliver that day moves it 4 days - then sends notification in morning of time and half hour before end time, emails to say will be late!"
148481,Got a date stopped in all day did not arrive waited 2 days did not come phone up said he came 3 times but then said becuase you used Amazon account they do not put the house number on the address so your driver came out 3times and went to the street and and turned around and went back ?l think you should sort this out with Amazon has its on your payment site
155091,"Prompt delivery, the guys who dropped it off were brilliant. Would use again"
109809,"Absolutely shocking company - never had anything but problems. Parts missing from items which they would not supply ?! Orders cancelled, try calling and they answer and hang up .. The people they have working on their chat are sarcastic.
30 seconds to take your money .. 30 days to get your refund ..hummm"
148576,"So after multiple calls & watts app messages the cheque for a refund arrives or rather about 10% of the refund from when I was incorrectly billed. I now need to wait another 30 working days for the rest to hopefully arrive. Why this cannot be paid more swiftly via a bank transfer I have yet to receive an answer for despite asking multiple times? Waiting months & having to have multiple conversations to get this error sorted is really very poor customer service. Most companies can sort a refund in a few days or on the day, not a few months, why virgin cannot do the same I am not sure and would be interested to know why?"
125337,I’ve been using this platform for collaboration for over a year and I love the result I’m getting from it!
117411,Tv only 4 months old sent for sound repair on 03/12/20 tv returned on 12/12/20 with a cracked screen delivery driver phoned up team knowhow regarding damage only to be told to send back for repair will cost to much to repair i would like a new tv but no one is taking responsibility even after numerous phone calls. I have tried to call customer services only to be passed from one to another and then having to join the end of queue again after getting through this is costing me money to call yourselfs it shouldn't be to hard to sort a new tv and not a repaired one .
165319,"I ordered my phone and it arrived 3 days later. It’s is in good condition and works perfectly.
I got a phone in 2019 from the same people, it is still working as good as the day I got it. The last phone took weeks to arrive and because of this I considered purchasing from some else.
I stayed with them knowing that I would get a good deal.
I am pleased I did."
100620,The entire process was very smooth and easy. My questions were answered quickly and thoroughly. The PC runs really well and is exactly what I was after. I have recommended them to a friend who is after a new PC.
182978,Craig D & Davidis were super friendly and helpful. Gave a courtesy call 30 mins before arriving. Both were very professional.
156209,"Great company, website and content. Have purchased books, CD's, DVD's and a phone from Music Magpie. All have been delivered quickly and well wrapped. Will continue using regularly many thanks to all at Music magpie."
149071,"So after having my broadband installed, you'd think it would be a simple process of connecting - WRONG! Vodaphone seem to have made the entire process as obtuse as possible."
135654,"they are for a Christmas present ,not yet tried them out but they are replacing ones from 10 years ago. Hopefully just as good quality."
135541,"Service for a new purchase is hard to fault with simple ordering, efficient despatch and quick delivery.

Earlier this month my garage reported that the 2 year old battery on my car was weak at only 46% capacity. It’s still under warranty so I reported this to Tayna and after lots of ‘can you measure this, does the car start, can you do that’ they diagnosed that my car’s battery was being, and I quote, ‘moody’.

They have asked me to remove the battery and send it back for them to test ….. postage at my expense and no offer to send out a loan battery to keep me mobile.

So while, when all is going well, Tayna is an excellent option, things seem to go less well when one needs some after-sales support."
142068,"The service is very efficient and easily tracked throughout.

I would highly recommend"
164843,"I’ve just talked to a person on the phone. I had questions about their services. The person was so unpleasant and tried to rush me. At the end, the man didn’t even say goodbye or anything, just disconnected the line. What a rude and impolite behaviour he has :("
172104,"Very fast service, kept updated about delivery by the courier"
140777,"Was a loyal customer for four years then had problems with slow internet and after them sending out new routers still no improvement. So in June I switched to BT who was a lot better. The only thing is talk talk still have me as a live customer? Even after sending my equipment back to them and having a sorry you’re leaving email. I have wasted hours of time on the phone trying to sort this but still now have no luck. Although they manage to send me letters asking me to pay or my service could be paused? Absolutely ridiculous. Was on the phone 3 hours and after speaking to seven different people and departments I was advised there isn’t much they can do and to wait for a manger to call me and go from there. Never had a call from a manager so I find myself again on hold for over an hour to then be told there is no cancel or complaint on my account? This has been and still is very stressful, frustrating and upsetting. I don’t know where to turn or what to do."
192867,"I believe this product to be at a good standard however, I haven’t had the chance to review it as it still hasn’t arrived. I ordered it 2 weeks ago."
167050,this is a great way to learn and experience new things in such a easy and fun way! love it!
160150,"Very easy to order my appliance online and at a reasonable price too.
Delivery took a few days but when it arrived the delivery guys were courteous, pleasant,respectful of property and helpful.
Would use again."
130765,"Excellent except for one thing. I was really pleased to have stumbled across PC Specialist. The advice was good and clear. The web site was easy to access/ negotiate etc. Everything seemed good value and all the reviews appeared genuine. However I assumed that the new machine would arrive ready to go so was a bit disappointed that I had to do the usual windows updates etc.
Small inconvenience I know in the scheme of things. I just thought that since PCS had run the machine for a period to test it they would have run the update routines. Still excellent though."
160378,A great offer for a product I've always wanted to have.
193231,Hid a price increase on my 24 month broadband contract in all the terms and conditions text. Should maybe max it clear if you're going to increase the price while someone is locked into contract with you.
153836,"Was worried about delivery because ordered in lockdown but delivery was pretty quick and after reading other reviews was quite surprised. Only issue I have was that I ordered pristine condition and due to three tiny marks on case of phone, I’d describe condition as good at best, apart from that good service reasonable delivery (but could make it clearer on time it takes) and easy to deal with."
134126,"I am about to start using BT not installed yet because of unexpected circumstances but so far I have great customer service. First of all I don't need to wait for hours on the phone to speak with someone (that usually drives me mad). All people I have talked with so far was polite and helpful. The engineer called me twice same day to check if there are any changes and he can come back and finish his job. Same lady that I talked with few days ago about my issues, called me back today to confirm my rebooked appointment and to make sure everything goes smooth. Well... compared to other providers (I've been with Sky, Virgin and Talk Talk) this is UNBELIEVABLE. I am impressed of the personal touch and customer care so far. Thanks Rebecca, thanks to the engineer too that you looking after me, I am impressed... I hope everything will be good for future and BT will be ""my internet provider"""
135216,Dish washer:- I phone and spoke to a lovely young man who was very informative and professional and polite my experience was 5 stars
178979,How easy it was and the amount of choice available. Also the delivery was faster than expected! And to make it better my calendars look absolutely amazing!! Used Optimal prints for 3 years in a row to make calendars for Christmas presents.
153805,My print did not arrive in the folder I sent emails and got no reply.
127979,"Crooks, after being a customer for 25 years decided to jump to O2 as Vodafone were going to start charging for EU roaming. Phoned up to cancel, was on SIM only deal and they had lied to me at beginning of sim only deal now stating that I couldn't leave for further 3 months, I left alway, 3 months later they have recorded a default on credit file for 3 missed payments totalling £50, credit rating was destroyed, thankfully Experien have managed to get the default removed and credit rating restored."
192959,"The part was inoperable so ended up buying a new machine.
Now even after I have returned the defective unit I still have not received a refund"
125908,"Good product, good service, good communication, good price. Happy customer, moved from AO as had poor experience there."
199265,"If I could give zero I would. Utter shambles of a company. I've been trying to shut my service down since June 22, seemingly my mobile number on my account doesn't match which is bizarre so failing security, I have had the same mobile number for years and managed to upgrade my account with them in August 21 with no problem, same mobile number. I'm hitting a brick wall, failing security over an incorrect mobile number on my account and inable to access my online account.......to fail securely on an incorrect mobile number yet able to supply every other detail regarding my account is remarkable, only other way they say is for them to call me on my landlines number....hello oooo I haven't lived there since June so no access...this company make it impossible to cancel....at least Dick Turpin had the decency to wear a mask! Ombudsman time, exhausting and disappointing situation....better things to be doing with my time than battle crooks!!!!!"
137937,"Awful company! Had constant hassling from them the moment I purchased a tumble dryer. After signing up to claim product warranty, I've been phoned and emailed continuously by the company to insure with them.
After saying bluntly to the sales team that I have purchased insurance elsewhere, because their plans are too expensive. I was then demeaned and shouted at by the customer service rep, this is not a way to try and get someone to sign up with your company!!"
140128,"Have bought, rented and sold through Music Magpie and I’ve never had any issues. Very reasonably priced, and fair prices for selling too. Wouldn’t fault them, and wouldn’t go elsewhere for selling tech."
178805,Found the item I needed and at a great price with free postage.
102868,Very knowledgeable & helpful in store. Filip sorted problem with my record deck promptly.
112208,"I ordered a used boxed PS4 Slim 1TB for £270 for my son for Xmas . Arrived in a plain white box . No PS4 markings at all. When I complained I was told that the CEX shop which supplied it couldn’t find it . Was offered a refund but no attempt was made to get me a replacement from any other store in the chain . I don’t really feel this is good enough customer service . Game sell the same device , same spec with no PS4 box ( supplied in a Game box instead) for £189.00 ."
189001,"Got up Saturday morning and decided I was going to buy a new fridge freezer look at the obvious choices AO , Currys etc their delivery and additional prices really bumped up the price plus a long lead time, simply ordered Saturday afternoon Delivered Sunday! Really happy and the delivery guys were excellent to. Well Done Marks Electrical, also posted on LinkedIn"
199756,This is one of the worst companies been taking money out of my account without me knowing. Tried contacting them and ended up going round in circles. Took more than hundred pounds out of my account. Thieves.
155622,First time ordering after I had problems uploading photos with the usual photo place I get my yearly calendar made from. I am very pleased with how the calendar turned out and fast service. Will definitely recommend and use again.
135974,Update: I got my pc back after 10 days even though warranty says 7 days MAX I think aswel as this they didnt update the graphics driver which they installed without me knowing which then caused my PC not to work at times
122532,"Parts were easy to order.
Very quick delivery."
106827,"Waste of time this morning called to set up broadband as had broadband for over 15 years, they can't do it. Absolute waste of time. Never had a phone contract with them thought I would give them a chance. Don't bother I'm now with EE and very happy."
187504,Quick delivery and a low price. Nothing else needs adding!
160872,This is an amazing opportunity for me to get help. I am a beginner in bodybuilding
149129,"Seems to be a common theme with the trade in on phones. The same thing is happening to so many people, they promise a price for trade in on your old phone, in my case £65 for a S7 edge, they receive the phone and surprise surprise it apparently has screen burn on it and are only willing to offer £15 for it. The phone was perfect when I sent it. So I ask for evidence like many people leaving reviews on here and get no reply as their email address bounces back as undeliverable- wow shocker maybe they can't man the email inbox with the amount of dissatisfied customers. I expect your standard response you have given to many of your customers. Now not even able to sell the phone privately for a decent price as I have binned the box and contents as I thought I was getting a fair price for the phone. When I tried to call their phone lines to get through to their customer service to raise a complaint, I explain everything to the first agent only for her to put the phone down on me after waiting over 35 min to get through to her. I ring again holding on for well over 40 min and I might as well be speaking to a brick wall.
Sort it out and honour the price or be up front and tell people that screen burn will decrease the value of the phone significantly and let the customer make the informed decision of sending the phone, even if screen burn can't be noticed by anyone but the CPW people.
Come on carphone warehouse whats going on !!!"
126182,"Everything went perfect , my B&W centre speaker arrived on time, which is quite a task this time of year and greatly appreciated.
Thanks to Jordan for outstanding service and advice.
Also a big thanks to Will."
126992,"Photos are fine - but I paid for priority delivery as I needed the photos quite quickly, I was charged an extra £6 for this, and was promised delivery by 4pm on December 10th. Photos didn't actually show up until 15th December.
I should have saved my money and just waited. I appreciate the issues with Royal Mail at the moment, but if SnapFish can't deliver within the timeframes they offer they shouldn't offer priority postage at all."
165302,Appalling service. I have the product cover and I cannot get the faulty item replaced. I have been sent incomplete and wrong drawers for my freezer and it is impossible to get through by phone. I wrote to customer services three weeks ago and still heard nothing. I am now going to try again by email and then by recorded delivery. This will be my last purchase from Currys. I will do without or buy secondhand rather than go through all this hassle ever again. How difficult can it be to send me the correct drawer for my freezer. Obviously impossible 😡
172777,"The delivery guys were very polite, courteous and helpful,"
167539,"I have ordered two phones from this company to date. I had no issues with the delivery of the first phone which I ordered on Black Friday in 2018. In fact when the phone malfunctioned I was able to return it within the warranty and it was repaired and returned promptly. Having had success I ordered a second phone on Black Friday 2020 and what a mistake that has turned out to be. We are now three months down the line and I still have no phone. Far from the 7-10 working day dispatch time! The confirmation of order email stated that there were limited staff numbers due to COVID and government guidelines but a three month delay seems incredibly excessive. What I find even more frustrating and unbelievable is that the company has not once contacted me to update me on my order without me having to email them first to ask for an update. They have offered a refund but I am now unable to afford a replacement as the Black Friday deals have come and gone. It seems very much as if the company are attempting to sell phones before they actually get stock in. I have been willing to accept an alternative phone of the same or better specification but the company are not willing to offer a different device, despite having several for sale on their website and having held my money all this time. Despite the success of my first order I definitely do not recommend buying a phone from this company. Unless something changes drastically my family and I will be steering well clear in all future purchases."
180837,"Do not normally write reviews however the service we have had by changing our broadband from Vodafone to Vodafone is absolutely unbelievable still no service letters stating sorry your leaving us and now before the service is live there is fault on the line the engineer told us it was up and running. !!

I could go on before you listen to the “advisors “. No downtime easy transfer keep your number bull defiantly think again I would not recommend."
123057,"Excellent service, prompt delivery, worked straight after installation, fair price. Recommended. My ""go to"" for memory upgrades. Thank you."
192325,"It was as simple as choosing what I wanted in a computer, they kept me informed of progress, the computer arrived and is working well. Good price as well for what I ordered. Highly recommended, especially as I have continued to use PC Specialist for many, many years."
102299,"Easy templates, piece of cake to add & alter wording.
Super quick delivery & very reasonable!
Highly recommend."
111818,I’ve got some amazing things I love shopping with you
152525,Absolutely disgusting treatment and service have been waiting over a month for a refund with no communication from any body to say I’m am fuming is a understatement 😡
136000,"I recently came back to BT for fibre.

Very helpful gentleman on the phone and we had everything up and working within 24 hours.

Service exactly as described, better deal put together than I could find on the web.

BT have definitely been working on the things that ticked me off a few years ago. Long may it continue."
159203,Superfast free delivery. Great communication as to when delivery would be. Will definitely use this company again
126307,"Great to deal with. Even though I had a hiccup on my order, they did not hesitate to get it sorted - swiftly, without hassle and with intention to put it right. I would happily buy again from FFX in future."
187733,"I've had broadband installed for about three years now and in that time it has been great, can't fault it. Contract renewals have been good value and I've had very little downtime over those three years."
140398,"Still waiting for a reply from customer service on email and they have the audacity to ask how is there service.
Seriously guys come on ."
170570,"Delivered on time with no issues.
Reasonable price and good quality screen, albeit (as is often the case) the controls are fiddly to use, although they will not be needed frequently."
132955,This is the third order I've received from optimal print and I can honestly say both the service and products have been second to none. Would totally recommend 100%
149607,"No problems easy, fast and good value"
177857,"Caine was a great point of contact through email. Understanding my impatience at receiving my new PC, and responding in a very down to Earth way."
165753,"Spent two hours trying to collect my click and collect phone on a contract and your chip and pin system was down so I couldn't collect the phone.

What kind of company doesn't have a backup system for verifying my identification for when the chip and pin goes down?

Will not be purchasing from Carphone warehouse again.

Don't know how they're still trading."
184428,"Great price (better than well-known electrical retailers), good stock (others were out of stock), really fast delivery service and accurate tracking"
157595,"My parents (now in their 80s) have been customers for years but the speeds provided by BT are absolutely terrible. Furthermore the speed fluctuates soooo much from 10mb down to half a mb. If you complain they don't care and come up with some crap (""it's the most your line can do"" then next month we can have double the speed if we pay 5 times the price but no change in lines) to fob you off. If the most my connection can do is 10mb why is my upload 16??? And why on this day and age am I on 10mb. And why do we still allow companies to sell ""up to"" values. Come buy a car from me and I'll give you up to a lambo. Would you be happy when I gave you a Ford Ka for your £100k (other crap cars are available - just like Internet providers)"
166907,Got a really good price for my phone clear instructions on how to send it to them and money was in my account very quickly.would definitely use again
121904,"I purchased a new camera bag which was great - no issues there and quick delivery. It had a promotional offer of a Joby 3K tripod worth £117.

I wasn't bothered about the tripod, I already have plenty. I only wanted the bag, but heck a freebie doesn't hurt.

Anyway, they say it's worth £117, it's a lie. You can buy them for less then £60 from Joby and other retailers."
121402,"Really pleased with my bundle. Next day delivery excellent.
Perhaps mention in ads if a computer is not wireless. My mistake really but would be helpful to the uninitiated."
142391,prompt delivery.competetive price.pleased with product.
112724,Excellent calendar especially as I was able to use 70% discount!
174788,"Had been checking reviews for Sound Bars, wanting good Dolby Atmos performance but also good music reproduction. Many reviews indicated the latter being a weakness of even higher end options. Having established a short list, it was a pleasure to talk with a staff member who was able to clarify and confirm our conclusions and assist us to settle on a final choice. An order was placed and delivered on time."
106696,The best brand ever!! I love all the products from them! 😍
107749,"AO do such a fantastic job of communicating about your delivery. Everything is clear, on time and well organised. Their staff are always super lovely too- Ive used them a number of times now and Ive always been so impressed with how polite, respectful and helpful their team is."
168642,Shoved adverts into a subscription service I already pay for which was the final straw. Attempting to blackmail customers into paying for AD free on top of the subscription. Regularly fail to have the most recent series of shows despite the fact they aired ages ago. NowTV player also clunky and irritating to have to use. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!
114662,The staff were helpful and knowledgeable.
126358,"Found it very easy to shop on line for my fridge and freezer. Excellent service from the 2 delivery men, on time and able to track how far away they were. Took away all the rubbish and recycled my old appliance. Would definitely recommend you."
133191,"Great communication, realistic trade in values superfast delivery."
195969,"No only do they crank up the prices when you're with them, but when you're gone they spam you with texts despite never agreeing to recieve marketting messages!

Apparently they don't know about GDPR, as well as being over priced."
138315,After 12 months of trying Rhyhannah actually gave me a date to get a smart meter installed.she took time and effort to actually understand the problem.
136505,"I spoke to a very pleasant man called iliyas, he was very helpful, I was really anxious before calling, but he put me at ease and dealt with my query efficiently without making any judgement. Thank you so much"
174477,"While the products are good value and my grandchildren were impressed with the personalisation, for both of the orders I placed I was later advised that one item from the order was out of stock and I would be refunded for it. I then had to place a further order with additional delivery fee. The second time this happened I went to Amazon instead."
187661,"They re-introduced roaming fees. Their reason for doing this, and I quote, is:
""That isn't what we'd like to hear. We always aim at giving great experience and be transparent with all our dealings. The new charge ensures that customers are clear on what to pay when using our services abroad, only those who roam will pay for the service. If you have any queries about this, please get in touch with us on ... & we'll do all we can to help.""

This is so stupid and nonsense, just say that, because of Brexit you can now do whatever you want and don't have to follow EU regulations anymore, and you want to make more money. But saying that you've done this so that the customer knows how much they spend is a lie, as roaming was free."
111128,The service provided was outstanding And faultless. I would recommend them to anyone.
125955,Easy online ordering and quick efficient collection
123407,"Absolutely Kafkaesque service. I have called to update my mothers television box which has slowed down a lot. My first phone call i was helped with updating my mothers contract and told she could get a new internet box (which included a £35 activation fee (but when it arrived all i did was plug it in and it worked straight away so it's clearly just a pointless added fee and i doubt we even needed a new internet box, nor did we call to obtain one)). The person on the phone then told me i needed to be transferred to get a new tv box. when i transferred and got through teh security once again i was told that a tv box was already on the way with my update. I hang up and then a week later no tv box but a new internet box. my mums tv box is still a nightmare. I call again and explain what has happened and i am told a tv box will be sent (another £35 activation fee, clearly not necessary) 1 week later and no information has been provided about our click and collect appointment (because they couldn't just send a tv box to an over a decade contract holder, for free). Today i call again and after dodging around automated phone services i end up with an employee saying ""sorry i can't hear you, i will have to hang up"" but not hanging up and juust repeating this while i say ""if you couldn't hear me you would have hung up already"" until the point where i swear because it is clear that they can hear me they say ""oh hello how are you?"" which is just the wierdest experience i have ever had on a customer services call. I explain my issues and am sent on to another employee. at this point i decide this isn't the kind of service i want my mum to have to deal with so i inform the employee that i would just like my mums service cancelled. At this point i am offered a discount from £92 down to £87 and have my tv box sent and installed for free and even have someone check the broadband signal at the house etc. after some back and forth on my end we decide to take that deal to save ourselves hassle or my mum not having wifi for a week or two. My mum has just got her bill through for the next contract and its £86 but with a £59 installation and activation fee! which almost entirely cancels out the deal that was offered and is not what was said on the phone call.

it's an utterly terrible way to go about things, the phone calls are painful and they never ever do what they say they are going to do. i just wanted an updated tv box for anb essentially broken one. my mum has been a customer for at least a decade, she pays ridiculous amounts per month, why can't virgin just send a new box for free to an old customer. this should be an expected part of the business"
145897,"This is the second time I've ordered a phone in 12 months - as gifts. Absolutely superb service, next day delivery and not a mark on it. Was a present for my daughter so she can gain her independence walking to and from school (and my piece of mind). I would definitely order for myself if needed too."
137462,Took a week to take my old washer away which i paid for. Refunded me 20 pound as goodwill gesture then told me they were cancelling appointment. After 3 calls they said they would turn up. Took the washer but also a dryer I had not asked them nor wanted them to take
178480,Great and easy hoover around the house we love it
148188,"Had ""issues in my area that's affecting my postcode"" for well over a month now, I can't work from home because I need my upload speed and it drops every 30 minutes. Every time I phone I'm told a different date it will be fixed and it never is, wasted so much money phoning them for updates because they never send me any through email or text DESPITE saying they would. Tried to cancel and was told there would be a £200 fee even though I haven't had the internet I'm paying for, absolutely ridiculous. Don't go with Virgin Media."
188282,"Giving them a rating of 1 as 0 is not an option, called to try and reinstate an old email address, rude staff not bothered in helping, then they just put the phone down while I was still talking, I would like to say I was being polite and respectful, time to get rid of the BT line and broadband, Vodafone options are twice the service for half the price"
156930,Good response and kept informed
139049,"Was easy to order, and was delivered well packaged"
132960,Very quick in sorting out any problems and in fixing any damage to your items.
180551,"Friendly delivery crew, no mess, on time, quick turn around."
190749,Awful customer service!!!! DO NOT USE THIS PROVIDER! Manipulative and disrespectful. Wasted 1 hour over the phone to talk about my disconnection for the second time as apparently they can just ignore cancellation requests and act like you never contacted them!!! Disgusted!
100407,still waiting on items i order at start of december and few were christmas present
154669,"UPDATE 2: Don't waste your time with this company! Contacted them via messenger (as requested in the reply below) 5 days ago now and its just a nonsense of back and forward. Giving up now. Obviously wanted to join Shell as I was supposedly going to be saving money but I have literally wasted hours of my life (first signing up 78 days ago) trying to become a customer that there will no longer be any savings.

UPDATE: I checked with my current provider and they informed me there is absolutely no way they would block a transfer...so who's talking nonsense?

One of the worst customer services I have ever dealt with. First signed up for broadband 7th October, its now 8th December. After a month and having heard nothing from them I waited in there ridiculously long queues just to have the call drop when someone answers (this is something that has happened on a regular basis). After being passed about the lady told me there had been an issue and the current provider was not allowing the transfer. She had no explanation as to why no one from Shell had bothered to get in touch. The call handler said she would follow the case and make sure it went through this time. Fast forward another month and I have had to call in again to tell them just to cancel the contract.

I would like to add that all the people I have talked with have been lovely there just seems to be a serious system failure when it comes to keeping customers informed. Literally not had a single piece of communication from them since my sign up date.

Why should it be me that has to waste my life in queues to try and become a customer. Communicate with your customers it might be an easy way to get and retain them."
109239,The lady who I was speaking to was polite and friendly very helpful and knowledgeable. And helped me sort the problem out very quickly the lady is a star 🌟
157607,"Had a problem with an order I called the customer service...what a joke that was the lady on the phone couldn't hear me mainly because the volume of people working there were shouting it was like listening to a teenagers party.
Really unprofessional and consequently extremely frustrating to the point I cancelled my order and went to a different provider"
152482,Engineer was efficient and explained what was happening
181973,"Great, compact external device. I was very pleasantly surprised by the light weight and size. Backed up all my data on laptop and phone very efficiently, easily and swiftly. Ebuyer service was great. The item was priced very competitively and delivered promptly."
197140,Took day off work to wait for engineer who didn’t turn up. He said that he had rung the doorbell. He clearly hadn’t as we didn’t hear and we checked cctv.
194645,"The on going saga continues, we have bt internet and a land phone line as our mobiles do not receive a signal where we live so I told bt that they must contact us on our landline whilst dealing with our complaint, guess what all calls over the past days have been made to the mobile which doesn’t work ! Including Wi-Fi calling because the internet is playing up. You couldn’t make this ridiculous amount of incompetence up !!!!"
123900,Lovely app well put together and efficient
153770,"Really easy to get a quote, get sent packaging and hear back from them with results quickly."
127565,Amazing company. They gave me an offer which I was happy with. They sent off the packaging. Sent it to them right away and received the money on the exact same day they received my phone.
164937,Delivered with the two hour window promised. Product (Bosch washing machine) good so far.
158512,On looking through my bank statements I found an entry for 1EC52 Boost.See Money Saving Expert on “Now subscribers should beware of Boost”.As described in this article they start taking £5 a month out of your account without you requesting this service.If you are subscribing to Now Tv check your accounts to see if they are doing the same to you.
103476,I paid for the delivery to happend on a Monday. On the day a recivied a phone call saying that this wasn’t any longer possible. This made me lost lots of time and money as I had to loose working hours. Not impressed at all!!!
172449,Easy transaction in my local HMV. Superb.
105682,It is clear that Shell are not interested in dealing with any Customer with a 1* review as none have been replied to so not going to waste my time. I will simply say their customer service is very poor!
115212,"From Michael.
I carefully wrapped my old iphone,and put it in its box.
I posted it at post office on Monday 8/8/22.
You had it on Wednesday. The financial side of things was dealt with overnight. How good was that. Great service,will use Mazuma again for sure. Great."
138062,"This current order will be my 10th or 11th purchase from PC Specialist, spanning the years 2007-2022 - desktops and laptops. The site configurators are easy to use - layout and finding suitable products is excellent. Build quality has always been top notch, packing suitable for safe transport, and customer support fast and helpful. The current configured desktop meets my ordered expectations. I would (and do) recommend this company to anyone looking to purchase computer systems or laptops."
126076,excellent and attentive service.
157433,"Super expensive service that has a poorly designed app, doesn't integrate well with Firestick, and has adverts on the exorbitant paid membership. Got it to watch one show and feel super ripped off, never subscribing to it again."

Well done Curry's for employing such a fantastic member of staff"
169045,"The card materials were fine. I would've liked the same font throughout but this didn't appear to be an option. I would've also preferred another free text page instead of a photo page, again this wasn't an option. Instead the only work around was to use a screen shot photo of the text I wanted which made it impossinle to match font and font sizes and ended up looking ridiculous. I've paid for and received them now so will have to use them as I'm not prepared to waste the money spent but if I'm honest I do think they look awful."
111953,Good product as described. Came quickly
185199,Delivered on time keep in touch all through well packed no complaints

127168,"Final piece of our kitchen jigsaw arrived. We have purchased all our main electrical items from Marks. The price is always spot on. Ordering by phone is a short queue, but this is a small price to pay for the good service. Staff on the phone are polite, efficient and confirm all details. Communication by e mail is prompt and accurate. Delivery time slot has been exactly as stated. Today's delivery time was to the minute by Craig D & Callum G. Despite the early hour on a Sunday morning they were very polite and friendly."
183390,I prefer to use Plugin Boutique when shopping for plugins. They have great prices and are much more than just an online store.
118896,"I placed an order over 1 and a half weeks ago and i have yet to receive it even after it was ordered with next day delivery to a local store for collection. I have not been given any information to say that I can collect it from the store. The store refuse to help because they say they don't have it if I have not been sent a collection notification and online customer service just says it has been delivered to the store. Tried multiple times to resolve this and been to the store more than once just to be told the same thing and to go away until they send a collection notification. So i have had no help so far to an actual solution, I have wasted so much time and effort for what is clearly their mistake and no one seems to care, they are just passing on the blame. What a useless waste of time trying to order anything from them. AVOID THEM!"
187625,"Good price, good product and quick delivery."
151026,Haven't explained why there is a price anaomally or why I'm being charged VAT in Jersey CI. IMO poor.

187549,"Ordering DVD went okay. Following day told it was dispatched to Edinburgh Fopp. Tried to phone numerous times to store to check arrival. No one answered even after being in queue, sometimes the phone just went ‘dead’. Went into store (aware of the 2-5 day delivery) package was there no one contacted me to confirm it’s delivery.DVD required for gift that weekend."

138215,"Don’t go anywhere else but PCSpecialist!

The best customer support I have ever experienced. I got my first Gaming laptop with a GTX 2080 and it had never failed me. The keyboard broke once and PC Specialist quickly and efficiently sent me a new Keyboard. I didn’t know what I was doing with it however so they took the laptop back and fixed it for me.

I have now got my Desktop with them also with a 3080 and 128gb of ram with a liquid cooled i9. It arrived on a pallet and was delivered very quickly once built. I thought I had to insert the graphics card and called to find out. When I did I found out the card was already inserted and what I thought was the graphics card was the Cooling from the graphics which was removed for my water block. PC Specialist could have kept the extra part, but I paid for it and therefore they sent me the extra part incase I ever need it.

They are the best! Do not go anywhere else if you can. You won’t regret it."
106157,"Really good experience. Sold some tech I no longer need, broken phones, ipads. It was easy to do - the money was sent instantly as promised. There was a slight mistake with one of the transfers, they sent the remaining funds that day. Where we didn't agree on a value, the item was sent back to me securely. It was a really simple process and was a great way to declutter. Happy customer - thank you!"

164522,"I bought this after reviewing several other cordless vacs. Easy to assemble and ready to use immediately, so I did ! I was actually amazed by the amount of dust this picked up from rugs and carpets I had vacuumed 2 days prior with my old machine. Easy to empty and I like the way this compacts the dust for more hygienic emptying. All in all very happy with purchase and pleased to support a British firm."

112352,Brilliant and quick delivery. CDs in great condition. V happy.

Ever since returning the both mattresses studio have refused to refund me and after 40 calls and speaking to every department including management still nothing and now my credit file has been impacted and my credit with them has been reduce loads

Now I have been forced to reach out to the financial ombudsman to resolve this issue

I would recommend not using them what so ever and when you have any disputes they all run off a script say the same thing and that they will arrange a call back which will never happen"
189660,"The service and support I received from Will and Jack in the Hanley store was second to none. Nothing was too much trouble for Will and Jack based on my questions relating to purchasing a Marantz receiver, Denon turntable and a pair of Bowers & Wilkins speakers.

Tech team apparently have no communication with the engineers and nothing is ever recorded or written down. They have no managers or senior staff when you call just untrained, unhelpful staff with no idea what to do.
One girl said ""well what do you want for compensation?"" ""I just have to fill something in my box on the form!!!!""
WOW!
Train your staff, more so train your managers who are too scared to speak to your customers and try using some telephone manner.
Waiting to cancel my contract, but obviously will not be that simple."

Apologised and advised would be returned within 7 days. Now 8 October 2020 still no tv, and have now not collected the Direct debit for this care plan. Unable to get through on phone as find difficult to waste over an hour of my life waiting to get through to no-one. I am work full time and have children to look after. We had to buy a replacement tv as school holidays was painful without the additional tv. Have now sent email to 3rd email address hoping some sort of response.
Update - after 1hr20mins on phone have been advised tv has been written off due to part not being made. When was I going to be told this I wonder or how long they have know this for. Now waiting a call back.
UPDATE - NO CALL BACK, NO REFUND. CAN'T BELEAVE THEY ARE STILL HOLDING ON TO MY MONEY. JUST WANT A REFUND AS ALREADY BOUGHT A REPLACEMENT TV. NEVER GOING TO SHOP AT CURRYS AGAIN"

114474,10 months of issues with fibre broadband dropping has culminated in me being forced to abandon the contract as Vodafone refuse to send an engineer after 10 months of calls.

163023,"As we were already in credit I was concerned our direct debit had gone up considerably again. After contacting Shell, Erna S has helped us switch to a variable direct debit to ensure we are now only paying for what we use and can use our credit over the winter. Very helpful and friendly service, especially as I didn't know we could switch away from a fixed payment. 5* customer support!"
178648,Took out a new contract via the telephone. Due to a signal issue after a couple of days I decided to return the device and cancel the contract. That was where I discovered the lack of customer service offered. It took me 2 weeks trying every day to get an answer on their webchat as their phone lines were closed (not the sales team though). They have now said I cannot return the phone because I was out on my 14 day cooling off period. Absolutely shocking service! Surely they cannot be allowed to sell a product if you are not able to return it?

159303,Early days but the purchased item (tv) seems very good at this stage. Online ordering was easy and price paid seemed very reasonable. I was telephoned to tell me that item was ready for collection. I collected item from Milton Keynes branch and appreciated the designated loading area. Staff were professional and collection time minimal.
183030,Quick reply then easy to talk to when I reported a fault on my cleaner. A replacement unit (under warranty) was despatched the same day (Sunday!) with delivery scheduled for the next day. Unfortunately the courier was delayed so it was only delivered on the Wednesday - that's not bad service!!! Thank you Gtech!
113679,Really pleased with phone and the 12 month warranty.. would buy from you again thankyou
146938,Absolutely useless. I’ve had 2 orders for different size Knipex grips go through to then get an email 4 days later saying I won’t get them until middle of next year!

I'm now posting this on my phone on the 12/05/21 as I still dont have any #%£@ing broadband due to... we'll they don't know. The engineer that came round was a top bloke and spent over an hour trying to sort it. No problem with him, but this company is steaming manure.

We had numerous problems accessing the service, and found broadcast cut whilst watching several times, so the pass was cancelled before the end of the free trial. Having not checked my bank account properly, I now realise I have been charged the full subscription rate of £33.99 for the last two months. I have just complained to NOW TV to say I have been charged despite cancelling, and they now claim the cancellation was incomplete. Despite their admission that I have not used the pass, they have said that they will credit the NOW Tv account with one month - despite me advising that there were problems with broadcasts anyway. I also got cut off twice from the ""Live"" representatives. Utterly disgusted!!"

On further investigation it turns out I failed the credit check, which they completely failed to tell me. They wouldn't give me any more information and aborted by application, but when I checked it later today it was 774! I consider myself lucky i wasn't able to sign up with these pathetic clowns and have since signed with Plusnet - a proper company!"

144237,"I don't think I've ever had properly hot food from Deliveroo, but this latest delivery is the worst yet. The tracker showed the rider going in the opposite direction to our house to make other deliveries, before coming to us. Our food was not insulated - but even had it been, the two ice-cream based milkshakes were in the same bag as the burgers and fries. This was a Five Guys meal, so incredibly expensive - and we had tipped the rider 20%, as we always do, given the reputation Deliveroo have on how they treat workers, so it wasn't even as if the rider hadn't been properly paid for the job. All in all we paid more than £50 for two frosted burgers, congealed fries, and melted shakes. Yum!

I emailed Deliveroo then and there, and three days later have had nothing but 2 bot emails saying they'll be in touch. Spoiler: they have not been in touch.

What an absolute waste of time and money. I never leave bad reviews - literally, never, as I tend to assume bad luck on the actually very rare occasions we get poor service. But this isn't bad luck. This is a terrible business model. And we will not be using them again.

EDIT: they have been in touch! To offer me £11.40, which for some reason they think covers even one burger (it doesn't) let alone the rest of the cost, as a credit. To spend with them on some other complete waste of money. I should note that I hadn't asked for a refund, as I was worried they might just deduct it from the driver's wages, and I was fairly sure the over-taxing of each person with more deliveries than they had drivers to service was the issue.

I just went in and permanently deactivated my account. We have a terrifying recession on the way, and I'm truly sorry for those who will suffer from it... but the fact companies like this will hit the wall? Really glad. They are parasitical industries, and in Deliveroo's case they aren't even achieving a basic level of competence in serving the need they exist to meet."
105263,"Had a really bad experience with Argos. I ordered a google home hub online on the 19th of December to be promised for collection at my local store today 23rd. (Just in time for Christmas) spoke to someone online chat to be told my delivery won't be in store untell the 26th the earliest and 29th the latest. How is this on time for Christmas as promised Argos ? I asked Argos if i could collect from a different store only to be told no i would have to wait. I asked for a full refund what can take upto 7days, however they quick enough to take your money but not to refund it back. Have to shop about to find one at late notice. Thank you so much Argos for messing me about. I won't be shopping at Argos again you lost a customer."

192605,"Wanted to cook my husband a nice meal but missing a couple of vital ingredients. I placed an order for delivery from the Coop on Swinnow Rd Leeds. I waited until it confirmed what items were in stock and that it was on its way, as if the items I needed weren't available, I couldn't cook the meal I had in mind. Yay they were all in stock and on their way.
I started cooking and preparing the rest of the ingredients. At 4pm there was a knock on the door, it was the delivery guy with my order. He put the delivery on my doorstop and asked my name. At this point I advised him that this wasn't my order as it had three cartons of juice and some ready meal pizza's. He asked me if I was sure and I said yes as the order number wasn't even mine.
He said he would ring them and sort it out and he left. I then got a phone call from what appeared on my mobile screen as Five Guys!!!! and a foreign sounding woman telling me there had been an issue with the delivery, did I want it cancelling or redelivering which would be 40-60 minutes. I really struggled as it was a bad line and she was heavily accented. I told her I had to have it as having been told the stuff was on its way, I had started cooking the rest of the ingredients. She said she would refund the delivery charge (whoopee big deal)! The call ended and then 5 minutes later the phone rang again and it showed on my phone as Five Guys. But it rang twice and went dead. I tried ringing the Coop on the number on the receipt and it went to answerphone. I left a message.
Surely, they check the order number when they collect it for delivery.
By now my online order #9936 was showing as delivered and complete but I had received nothing. I rang Five Guys, the guy I spoke with said that the order had been reprocessed and would be with me within 40-60 minutes. I asked what happens if what I need is no longer in stock, he told me it was showing as in stock and would be despatched shortly.
I asked how I made a formal complaint, he said he would put my comments through and I said I wanted to make a formal complaint myself with all of the details. He just wasn't getting how they had ruinned my romantic evening. 5 minutes later I got an email saying the Coop could not fulfil ANY of my order as it was out of stock.
I had better not get charged.

So folks, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID Deliveroo and the Co-op - I'm a Coop member and shall be telling them too.

Take away for tea and I won't be using Deliveroo!"
135696,"I don't care how cheap a deal Virgin may look... it just isn't worth all the hassle and endless explaining of the various problems you'll end up with if your installation is anything like mine.
I've had to explain to support over and over and over and over again to so many different support staff who promise to help but they cant help and inevitably end up cutting off the chat leaving me back at the end of the queue again and this happens quite frequently.

They even refused to send a deadlock letter so that I could take my issues to the ombudsman, telling me that's not what was needed!

They want almost £300 to terminate the contract even though the phone never worked for weeks, and the internet service is still so unreliable that I'm now using the hotspot on my mobile phone for internet service as the virgin service breaks every half an hour.

it's been the biggest mistake of my life signing up with this company."

107649,"Completely Unhelpful!

I never signed up for Team Know How, but I had bought an appliance a year ago at Currys. I recently received a redirected letter from Team Know How telling me the warranty was expiring and asking me to sign up to cover.

I tried phoning, but after no answer for 20 minutes I thought I'd email instead.

I emailed to let them know I no longer have the appliance in question, and I also no longer live at that address - so please could they remove my details (I don't want mail being sent to the old address when the redirect stops - plus they also never took the correct title for me).

I received a reply saying that they would need more personal details from me in order to progress my complaint - I never said I was complaining I just asked for my incorrect details to be removed.

Then get a reply asking for me to confirm more personal details in order to 'opt-out' of marketing. I said well, the details you have are wrong, so I just want you to remove them.

I then received a second redirect letter.

I emailed again to say I had told them I didn't own the appliance and I no longer lived there, yet had been sent another letter. Please remove the incorrect details.

Their reply this time was in order for them to progress my data access request, I need to contact them in writing with photo ID.

I never asked for data access, I know you have the wrong details and I just want you to remove them.

Each emailed said they needed more information from me for GDRP reasons. GDPR is there to protect people's personal details and stop unwanted marketing. Not to allow the company to hold even more personal details that the customer doesn't want or need to give. I also work in an organisation where we comply with GDPR, if someone contacts us to let us know they want to be removed or the details are no longer correct, then we remove or update straight away - not ask them to jump through hoops and provide even more personal data.

My ask was simple, please remove details as they are not correct or relevant. At the very least you could have removed my address and opted me out of other marketing.

Very disappointed and frustrated with how 'Team Know How' have managed this.

Edit following reply - I did give all information needed in the emails (name, address, phone number, store, receipt etc), and still got unhelpful replies."

124443,"I was previously a NowTV broadband customer and in fairness, had no issues.

However, it transpires that since summer of last year, a Sky Sports Mobile Package had been added to my account with debits taken off my card on a monthly basis. From a bit of research it appears this is a common occurrence and looks almost certainly due to data breaches within the NowTV systems.

I’ve requested a refund as I didn’t ask for, nor want a Sky Sports Mobile pass. Unfortunately NowTV deems it ok to keep my money. The customer services has been exceptionally slow, almost as if it’s on purpose…..

If you’re looking for a decent broadband or TV supplier I’d advise you to stay well clear of NowTV."

And please don't be fooled by their cheap rates- they recoup all of your savings towards the end of your contract by charging you almost 3 times as much as your regular payments. And ironically it seems all legal as it is confirmed on the small print! Customer Services either do not understand you at all or pretend not to understand you. They kept hanging up the phone pretending they can't hear me. I was calling them from a Virgin line, apparently the line is really bad. I had network issues in my area since September 2022 and despite promptly reporting these issues, apparently it is too complex and taking longer than expected to fix. During the very same period they put the prices up by 134% from £29 per month to £68 per month. A friend of mine and my brother complaint about being mistreated in the exact same manner. They both left Virgin for good. You can't get help from anywhere as the complaints department sends out a standard email out without even bothering to read your complaint. My contract is ended I would like to disconnect the services however I can't do that either as I have to give them a month's notice at a cost of whopping £68! Stay away from these people as they are corporate glorified crooks!"

Then I phoned and the lady said she also could not see were my order was would get phone call back net day , NO phone call . Tried again on the phone was told this time after a lot of tow and froing . Then told it was in the shop and had been there all the time. Guess what went to store and it was not there. Also after coming off the phone at the same time as the lady looking at my order some one ??? had canceled the Microsoft part of the order. Your service department have lied to me twice and you should check you phone calls as you say you record all of them. You have taken my money and have not delivered. I had a nice girl at the Didcot store called Stephany help me the best she could but could not help in the end as she has had to pass it on to another department.

It arrived when it was meant to. I will buy using PC Specialst again if I ever need to buy a new PC. The build software on the website keeps everything in check as well. If your components don't work together, it will let you know what is needed to rectify the problem. The cost of getting the company to build the rig is not that much more than getting the parts yourself, just without the hassle, and you then have a guarantee for the entire build, not for individual parts you have purchased yourself.

186633,"If I could give zero stars I would, Vodafone are by far the worst company I have ever had to engage with.

We upgraded our contract to full fibre in a November 2022. The engineer came out on time and fitted the necessary tech. Broadband worked fine for the first few days and then just stopped. I was told a technical error occurred and cancelled the upgrade leaving me with no internet services. I contacted customer services to be told it would take five working days to update my account and set up internet services. Which I find unbelievable, Internet is essential and leaving us without for 7 calendar days is very very poor.

Internet services were eventually set back up with the help of a very helpful team member who spent over an hour on the phone with us. During the 7 days I contacted Vodafone several times requesting the fix be escalated to no avail all I kept being told is the back office team are aware and will deal within 5 working days. We needed the Internet due to working from home but no one seemed to care.

The internet services have been reestablished but there is still an account issue preventing me from cancelling my contract and switching provider. It’s now been 20 working days waiting for them to fix my account so I can cancel. I have today again been told it’ll be fixed in 5 working days and there’s no way to escalate this at all. So Vodafone are essentially trapping me with them until they decide it’s appropriate to fix my account. I’ve never known such poor customer service.

Update: I have since been in contact with Vodafone, they have fixed my issue as of 05/01/23. However in doing so they have put me back on my previous contract which I was not made aware of. Despite multiple assurances on a recorded line while in full awareness of the situation that If I cancelled I wouldn’t be charged an early termination fee. They are refusing to honour this and trapping me in a contract until 2024."

I moved and ordered BB 3 weeks before, only to find out by myself a few days before it was due to be activated, that they cancelled it due to ""Technical issue""!

Given the first month free if I sign up again, so AGAIN after a week of ordering, I check MYSELF to find out they cancelled it AGAIN without telling me!
Useless chat person took over 40mins to actually tell me the reason this time, it was because I couldn't bring my old number with me and they tried to blame Open reach for the cancelation! It was not OR responsibility to tell me the order was cancelled, ffs!
I never thought I would be one of these people writing bad reviews about a company, but after being pissed around by them and wasting over 4hrs of my time on chats and ordering, I am so pissed off!

The phone has spent the whole 12 months I have owned it in a case with a screen protector. The phone has has its whole back internals replaced about 6 months ago due to a warranty fault. This means the whole back of the phone and internals are only 6 months old.

Its now 27/9 and after 10 days of being unable to use the cooker and having to go out to eat or have takeaways (VERY EXPENSIVE) I had my cooker replaced,but obviously I didn't buy AEG again.I feel that the whole of this team and staff have no worries about how all this has affected me I'm out of pocket food wise and the hassle I've been put through is unbelievable,I dpoke to someone called Tim at customer care?there is no care,about some form of compensation guess what he said he would allow me £20 oh goody goody I won't know what to buy if and when I get it.It really is disgusting"
151048,"Wanted to order bags for cleaner. The operator went straight to the details of my original purchase, and i ordered accordingly. She even advised me where to see the model no. ( under the battery in my case ! )"
187299,I've been using these guys on and off for my broadband for the last 3 years. The hub delivery and set up have always been incredibly quick. If there have been any issues or problems the team are always extremely helpful and go out of their way to get it sorted. I highly recommend these guys.
181252,Very happy with going into dunfermline store yesterday and spoke to declan about my faulty washing machine. I was told I could not get it written off until the 12th January as that's been 7days since the engineer had been out. Well he wrote my machine off for me in store and I was told that I would get a voucher within the next 72hrs. Well thank you so very much as I have already had my voucher and already purchased my new machine that will be delivered on Saturday.
137340,Issues with transferring to O2 mobile from Virgin. Eventually sorted out in January. Got fed up with being told to contact customer service.
139764,"Get equipment on the 29th, try to set it up but it's non functional however it activated the services (and billing of course), upon many calls to virgin I finally managed to get it to work 8 hours later, I enjoy 24 hours of internet to then get cut off again for 24 hours, get it working again and have 24 hours of intermittent signal (comes and goes every 10 minutes), got fixed so I enjoyed maybe 24 hours of a slower than normal experience. Then it went down, and it's been down for 72 hours. Virgins response is let's book you an engineer, 1 week from now. I rejected and requested cancellation to which they said ok and passed me on to retentions, however they booked in the rejected date as if it had been accepted. Fast forward and I've spent 2 hours in the last 2 days speaking to this retention department with the following results:

1st call - very polite and apologetic and confirmed I wouldn't pay any fees for the first month due to bad experience, also confirmed my cool down period could be extended as a result and I would get it in writing (all I got in writing was that I accepted the 1 week from now date and complaint was closed)

2nd call - don't think this person knew what they were doing, apart from being condescending and rude they kept me on hold for 20 minutes and hanged up!!!!!! (45 minutes lost in total)

3rd call - person was a lot more helpful but was clearly trying to get rid of me, I was promised a call back in 10 minutes, it's now been 30 minutes.

Overall would never ever recommend virgin to anyone in any background or budget, horrible experience and I've had service for 4 days out of the 9 I've had it for, long wait times for engineers, whenever there's an issue all you will get told is wait 24 hours.

Edit 12/01/22:

After many more calls and backwards and forwards with virgin, the engineer wait time did not change, the broadband worked for 1 day in the last 5 days and then according to their own staff and app they have deactivated my account/services for two days until the engineer arrives, not even the call centre could tell me the reason why as quote on quote ""it doesn't make any sense"". (I have recorded this call and informed the agent and I'm seriously considering posting it online so people have a sample of the ""quality service you can expect from virgin"".

Just a heads up for anyone reading this even though I was in my cooling off period and tried to cancel I was first told I needed to pay a disconnection fee (poor staff training) and after that hurdle I've been told I need to wait and pay an additional 30 days of service to get disconnected (on a non working broadband)"
181743,been 3 weeks without a oven still not got it repaired even though its under warranty. got 3 kids and no oven. will it be done before christmas??????????argos use low quality repair companies they dont care about customers only selling to them.
111081,Wonderful customer service. Helped me when a delivery got lost and they sent a replacement. Brilliant communication and help. Will definitely use again.
193998,Domestic & general sent plumber to fix my AEG washer dryer which I have had for 2 years plumber came and said it needed parts didn’t hear anything for a few days phoned domestic & general to be told they couldn’t get the parts. I paid £150 up front I hope I get my money back

133135,Some envelopes were damaged by your really poor flimsy packaging... still waiting for replacements...
134336,"Sean sorted out an issue getting my credit back after leaving Shell. He dealt with it faultlessly.

The continual credit build-up coupled with increasing DD payments (that I could not reduce) was the key reason I left Shell. I suspect they are using their customers for interest-free credit! Not any longer for me!"
104585,Amazing service and super speedy delivery. Price was great and the quality of the product was just what I wanted. I’d recommend to anyone.
199352,Excellent friendly and capable service from both chaps who delivered the two appliances at an earlier time than expected. They arrived and fitted the washing machine and oven efficiently and provided me with good communication/ information about my appliances.
160504,"Awful, just awful, trying to contact Customer Services to help sort an issue out on behalf of my 74yr old Mum who has been unable to navigate Virgin's impossible chat system, on chat now for nearly 3 hours re-explaining myself to each and every agent I get transferred to, each one asking exactly the same questions as the one before, each one not reading my summary of events (which I provided for their ease). I don't think I have ever been through such excruciatingly bad service in all my life. As yet I have no clear answer on how we proceed. I got so incensed by the process that I have contacted the CEO. I still don't know how best to proceed to solve her issue as the 'staff' at 'customer service' or unable to answer the questions I have, or just plain avoid answering them but asking me another irrelevant question. The customer service team seem totally clueless about the Social Tariff Package, and simply cannot answer questions about it. I even had to send the link over from your webpage about it, even then they didn't seem to be able to help. They just kept pushing to sell me another product. I am asking a slightly complicated question as I want to know if she can get out of a contract and on to the new up and coming social tariff contract for pensioners, but no-one can answer it, no-one knows when the potential start date is or if she can jump across when it does without fees.

Thank goodness I did this, can you imagine my 74yr old mum having to sit on chat for nearly 3 hours!!!!"
174215,"The choice of dehumidifiers was good, the ordering process likewise. A prompt delivery, a slight issue was very quickly resolved. I would use the again."
122620,"Two problems
Should the filter have been fitted vertically as it is horizontal ?
Also the base is on a wooden plinth and the front feet are over the front of it and therefore the fridge is leaning forward and unsteady !

192876,"Had issues from the day i signed up. Contacted for simple enquiries as unable to log in online. Advised twice i was due to have work done at the house the SAME day i was talking to them each time. I then ended up requesting complaints be raised. Only received a reference for one of them. I then receive emails thanking me for our conversations and managing to RESOLVE the complaints when ive not heard a thing back! Crazy that they do this in writing as well, make the ombudsman complaint a bit easier to explain!"
112676,I've been conned out of literally hundreds of pounds due to miselling of a mobile phone by Carphone Warehouse two years ago. The salesman was very pushy and tried to make out he had my best interests at heart when he very clearly didn't. Not long after having had the phone it was faulty. I took it back to the shop but they just didn't want to know. I was therefore stuck with a phone which didn't work and was stuck with a contract which was bleeding me dry. Please guys do not use Carphone Warehouse. You have been warned
180913,"My last bespoke PC purchase was 12 years ago. A very highly spec’d machine that has only needed a new PSU in all that time. I expect my new one to go on for a similar length of time!

I’ve was impressed by the ease of use of the website, range of components and pricing offered by PCS. My only suggestion would be to include links to some independent reviews of components.

The machine arrived extremely well packaged and DPD are in my view the best courier service. I had it up and running and loaded with my choice of Office 2021 in a matter of minutes.

All of the spare leads and mounting hardware were in a box with software discs and a guide and the smallest USB boot stick I’ve seen. Some reference to the latter for those who are less familiar would again be helpful.

The full size PC is beautifully built, with 5 drives giving 26Tb of storage, an i9 processor and Rog Maximus III motherboard. Much thought had been given to wire routing and clipping and to cooling resulting in a really well built and thought out build which is performing really well.

My only other suggestion would be for more links to advice on cloning and transfers from old machines. I’ve just updated the SSD in my old ASUS laptop and had 2Tb of programs and data to shift from my PC.

My only criticism would be I wish they’d have told me they had had problems with a power outage that interrupted testing on previous production and so held my order up, but an email was replied to promptly with an explanation. Otherwise I’d award 5 stars."
142243,"Excellent communication, fast delivery and superb product"
162830,"Really poor customer interaction for potential new customers like myself and my friends and family.

I had a few simple questions. Alarm bells were ringing when I couldn’t find a customer support telephone number. You do everything talking to a Robot chat which didn’t supply the answers.

Shame that a relatively new start-up are woefully alienating new customers who may not have the computer skills to signup to their product.

Very poor first impression, I’ll stick to Sky and BT."
128305,"Ever since I started my contract, my data has been very poor where I can’t even browse the internet when I have 4G/5G and 2 bars of service. I have the IPhone 14 Pro Max so it’s not like I have an old phone. The coverage map checker says that atleast 4G is excellent in my area and I’ve been in store multiple times to complain about the issues I have but I always get told that there is apparently nothing wrong and won’t do anything."
192833,"21st December update; no payment refund of cash back offer customer service team said it was processed 9th then 16th and now on the 21st there is a error, on chat laruah reply was our customer service is good but we must just be letting you down. I haven’t had any response to emails and they mentioned below they email you. They still haven’t. I will continue to update with edits in hope this saves another customer. Edit; the reply of email sent to customer is in fact false. No email is sent to us.. I am normally a huge music magpie fan. But the past few days the customer service has been shocking. I was told I would get a cash back offer because I sold and bought on the site. Friday last week I was sent a email that this had been sent and would clear in 3 working days. This was your own email. 4 days later nothing, I contacted your advisor one who said try again later I can’t help you. The other today who said Monday isn’t a working day it should be there today. Yet again it isn’t there.. I have given up with your on line chat. May I add your advisor said I was working the chat wrong because the only way to get to speak to a human is to pretend you can’t order. Go figure you get an advisor in seconds if your loosing money!
I would like my cash back and a final resolution to the matter."
122508,"They claimed that they deliverd the mifi device I purchased. But they didn't. It was really hard to contact them afterwards. After they sent me a device with a wrong sim.
After everything I went to the store where they didn't even apologise. I had to wait for a long time to get it done."

184641,"Ordered a Bosch fridge/freezer and a Hoover washing machine from Currys. Delivery day arranged with a 9.00am to 1.00pm slot. Received a call from ""Knowhow"" delivery team at 7.00am, (on the day of our kitchen re-fit), to let us know they were five minutes away. Told them the slot was for 9 till 1, - very grumpy response and told us they would let their depot know, but suggested it might be that afternoon or the next day. Got a call back from Knowhow's depot to be told it would be that afternoon, but no time offered and told, also, that there were no deliveries the following day. Received another call just before 5.00pm to say they were just round the corner. At that very time, we had a crisis - a potential flood. My wife explained this to the driver, to which he responded, ""You need to make your mind up, love !"" She decided to put aside her contempt at his attitude and reluctantly told him, despite our huge difficulty, to bring the items. His response was, ""You're too late, love, you'll have to have them at the end of the day."" When they eventually arrived, they were clearly in a mood and virtually ""bounced"" the fridge freezer into the kitchen. One of the team disappeared back to the van, whilst the other one (recognized his voice from earlier calls), quickly presented a device to sign. I asked politely, if I was signing for receipt of the goods, or that the goods had been received undamaged, as there had been no offer to unwrap either appliance to check condition. He didn't answer my question, but suggested that he didn't get paid for being around at that time, to which I suggested that if his depot had got it right by delivering 9 till 1 and not attempting to deliver at 7.00am, all would have been fine.. I suggested also, that if he had any issues about whether or not he is paid, he should take it up with his manager and not burden us with his complaints. As he walked out of our home, he remarked, ""Anyway, I hope they are both damaged!"" We really enjoyed dealing with Currys, but if dealing with Currys means that we have to have Team Knowhow as part of the deal, then we will probably look elsewhere for electrical appliances, in the future."
188054,Smooth process of changing contract from one provider to another. New phone arrived promptly too.
168023,"Great service, very helpful discussions on the phone with excellent options, suggestions and clarity of details when asked about installing full fibre to my house"
143101,The worst company in the world. Delivery drivers are useless and lazy. They cut every corner possible to avoid delivering appliances I am building a case against them as have video footage of entire ordeal of the lies the driver told.
108673,The phone that I purchased is great after having it only a few days. It will be good to see how long it lasts

170443,I’m still new to the app but I’m already enjoying it . Fast and effective app . I have been recommended by a friend on Social Media .so far it is a great platform
182286,"Extremely poor customer service, and will not correct mistakes that they make: they have a feature where you're meant to get an automatic discount if you buy from the same take-away multiple times; unfortunately, when I got my discount it was immediately expired (i.e. the email that said I've earned the discount also stated I had -11 days in which to use it)!
Multiple emails and screenshots later, and they still couldn't understand the issue.
I've since saved lots of money (far more than the discount could give) by cancelling my subscription. Here's why:
* I think twice before getting a take-away
* Picking up orders myself is cheaper
* It's easier to rectify issues in the store when collecting
* You strike up a rapport with stores you regularly use, and they give you free stuff to try out"
174304,"On 11th June, following receipt of email advising massive price increase on 3 PAYG from July 12th which also said I could request a refund of my credit balance I have found the customer service to be appaling, raised a complaint ref 32300541 and they keep trying to sell me a new sim bundle.
Got a call on Friday 24th June requesting my bank account sort code and account number which I provided and was told refund would be processed. STILL WAITING.
Three seem to want to keep my credit balance. When I took out the PAYG sim it was calls 3p a minute, Texts 2p and data 1p MB. this latest increase wants calls 35p a minute, texts 35p and data 15p mb. Three moved the goalposts, they should refund the credit on PAYG customers accounts when requested without quibble.
Contacting Three has been a frustrating experience, would recommend that people avoid this company if they want to be treated fairly."

They have given various different dates by which work on the masts will be completed, all come and gone and the latest date for completion of work has now been given as 10th. July 2021 ... True, they have allowed a 'Waver' on my billing but, I remain without service in the interim.

Called you and the agent confirmed that we should have 5 ghz in the same room as the router and out of 4 devices only 1 was benefiting from this whereas the other 3 only had 2.4 ghz. Asked for a WiFi booster as I have been overpaying £37 per month for the service I am receiving, been refused that. I've been offered a technician to come and take a look but I would have to pay £25 for it????? Given I am paying the full amount and you provide less than half the internet(350mbs in contract and I get 77mbs download), I find it unacceptable to be told I might have to pay this if the technician doesn't find a fault. There is a fault, you already noticed that and made me aware of it,the manager was short and had no willingness whatsoever to work with me. I never once asked for compensation and he very smugly said I can't give you compensation. I DID NOT ASK FOR COMPENSATION! I only asked for the product I AM PAYING FOR. Asked to cancel the contract as the customer service and the Internet have been subpar, only to be told I would have to pay over £200 to cancel,i told the manager that I wanted that waived as I didn't believe I received the service I have been paying for(which was confirmed earlier in the call). Again a big no as an answer, I can only do that if a technician confirms there is a fault, again you see there is a fault, you made me aware of it. Asked for a final response letter so I can take this further because I was not happy with the resolution provided was told I couldn't get that because the technician has been booked to confirm a fault you already know exists."

Delay in delivery but kept up to date By company."
183706,"If I could rate this company with a negative amount of stars I would. Persistently wasting my time regarding a faulty television, claimed a driver was sent and my address didn't exist (when was confirmed by agent booking pick up),lied about calling and claimed nobody answered, second attempt they 'forgot' to book in pick up. When they eventually managed to pick up the TV, claimed there was no fault and insisted I have to accept the TV back to prove there is no fault. Was sent a text to say television would be delivered on specific day, called to confirm and was told same, nobody showed up. When asked what happened got another sorry excuse blaming system error. Eventually was returned the TV with the exact same fault, are now refusing to exchange it despite statutory rights. TV unusable for purpose and manager callback as promised never happened. Also decided to inform me there are repair fees when they were never mentioned until TV was returned unfixed. Blows my mind how terrible this service is. Will go to trading standards as no interest from Team Know How on adequately resolving the situation."

131467,"Absolutely appalling. Engineer called out the following day after I had ore-booked repair on line. Did not have any spare parts on van and could not and did not attempt to open door so clothes are still in the locked drum!
Disgraceful.
Yesterday I rec’d email stating parts no longer available ;appliance inky 3yrs oks) so choose another. I am expected to pay for installation which I am very very annoyed about. All costs should be borne by D&G as they cannot uphold the contract of warranty.
If u could u would score 0 as 1 is far too high a score"
189337,My photos were not delivered on the date I was told. I left contacting Snapfish for a week after the due date because of the UK postal strike. When they still didn’t arrive I contacted Snapfish. Apologies were made and I was told the photos would be printed and sent out again. I received those within 2 days. The original order arrived a few days later. The Snapfish service was excellent after I explained my problem.

107904,"Customer service was first class, all though replacement battery which cost £60 +only lasted 4 week but they sent out another replacment free of charge"
129000,"Very sad to see Shell rewarding their staff with 8% bonuses as a result of high profits, but doing nothing to help their customers with their bills. They could have at least cut down on the exorbitant daily charge for supplying fuels."
127995,Item not received. It was resent and still not received. Not good enough especially when it’s a Christmas present that was ordered 6 weeks in advance!!
122045,"Shell Energy Broadband quoted me £29.99 a month on an 18-month contract for over 100mb download speed broadband. Sound good? It did to me too, until I realised it's completely impossible to get it set up with them and the customer service is dire. After setting up the direct debit, I was told an engineer will come and set the Wi-Fi up on the 28th of October (today) between 8am and 1pm and that they will need someone to be present in the flat at the time. I made arrangements for someone to give up their day and wait in the flat for the engineer whilst myself and my partner were at work. We had received 3 text reminders about our appointment... one of them being less than 24 hours before the appointment itself. My friend waited in our flat ALL day and said no one turned up. No one contacted me, no texts no calls no emails.. NOTHING. So I rang OpenReach who were meant to be fitting it and could not get through to a real person. I then rang Shell up and had to wait an hour and a half to get through to someone, when I finally did, they barely spoke English and did not help at all, all they did was tell me it had been cancelled. I said called when? they did not answer and just repeated that it was cancelled. I said what now? she said wait for someone to call me to rearrange. I then, 3 hours later, receive a generic email stating that our set up appointment has been 'rearranged' for 30th of November. OVER an ENTIRE MONTH away from the original date. That's 6 weeks wait time just to get set up when we are living in a flat where we receive no phone service. No chance. The absolute cheek of this company. I rang up said I want to cancel and the man on the phone said the 30th is the soonest available date would we accept £25 credit on our account towards our bill - shocking. So glad this happened when it did so that I didn't end up stuck in an 18-month contract with this shamble of a provider. DO NOT USE."
110867,"The used section of site is easy to locate product and very detailed information. I have used Wex for new equipment but first time I have purchased used, it was described as in mint condition and it certainly was I was very impressed was almost like receiving brand new, despatched and delivered promptly, I have never been less then totally satisfied with equipment and the excellent service, and will continue to use and recommend them."

115188,Purchased a pay as u go SIM card. The balance went to zero in a matter of 4 hours without making any phone calls. Customer service eventually found out that the phone number I was given had already been used previously and the account wasn’t closed correctly. Never got my money back from 3. Didn’t even offer a refund. Said they would send a new SIM card but that never showed up. Customer service is next to useless. Will never use them again.

176551,I bought a refurbished iPhone 7. After six months it stopped being able to make phone calls. I took it to apple and they told me it had had three massive repairs done on it before and it would cost the same amount as a brand new phone to repair. I feel I should have been told whether my iPhone had had massive repairs on it and was likely to break again. Will be steering clear of this website.
129936,Had excellent customer service from Liam Dunkley and lily watts at Wex Bristol store . Very helpful and informative on the different cameras we were interested in . Very happy with our purchase

Nothing was sent and he had not arranged anything - I then called back the next day to say - again that the item I received was faulty and it had to be returned - a week on I have now received a replacement plan for an item that didn't work and after calling to complain that I just wanted to close my account - but this cannot happen until the receive the faulty item back - also the replacement plan I bought still has not been processed - I then receive a text message to say they are increasing my credit limit !!! You can keep your credit - I want nothing more to do with you!! After todays phone call I have now spoke to 5 people within Studio - all in their call centre - who actually don't care about anything you are calling about!!!

Note the reply from studio - basically they called me to see they can see I have contacted them and promised a manager would call me back - as yet - no phone call!!!!"

Today I received an email receipt to say I had purchased the sky sports monthly package and £33.99 has been taken from my bank account. Which of course I did not.
There is literally no way of getting in contact with them urgently to rectify this. No contact number available, the online messenger is robotic and not run by an actual customer service staff member so it couldn't help with my request.
Submitted a complaint but who knows how long that will take to be responded to."
194671,"If I could give no stars I would, customer service is shocking. Spent 4 hours on the phone to get through and to be hung up not just once but three times. Finally got my washing machine booked in for an engineer however only through beko not curry’s. Told I need to buy a part to phone and order. Phone curry’s long wait in phone again and to be hung up on again! Phone back and person laughs and hangs up again. Absolutely shocking. Nearly two weeks without washing machine that is only 4 months old and no further forward of when it will be fixed. Shambles. Disgusting and will be going to the papers."

135745,Awesome experience. It was almost nee lens without any flaw.
154641,"If I could leave ZERO stars, I would. The service is appalling. Weak signal frequently. When there IS a decent signal there are constant interruptions when you have to log in to regain service. Watching a movie is impossible, typing an email is a challenge. Last night I had NO service, none. Frustrating beyond belief. I paid for 5 days, to cover a period when I had no home internet. BT wifi looked to be the best solution at the time. If I ever need a similar stopgap service in the future, I'd definitely look for a different route. Bottom line? This service SUCKS. BT should be ashamed."

Well done lads, and a huge Thank You!!! Currys liffeyvalley Dublin give yourselves a round of applause!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏"

During this time I haven't used any minutes, messages or data at all as the phone has been turned off but they are now saying I will be charged another months bill to cancel from today as I haven't used the PAC code. I have now been charged £68 in bills when I haven't even anything on the phone and requested the contract to be cancel a month ago.

They don't listen at all and are more bothered about money. I have another phone contract will three which I will now be cancelling as well as they are more bothered about money than making the customer happy and fairness. I will never ever use this robbing company again, DO NOUT USE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

137900,"Great Service and Product. The quality of the product was very good and was the cheapest I could find. I called multiple times and was able to reach the customer service line quickly, and the staff were helpful and friendly. One of the reasons I called was because my laptop was missing certain drivers, but the staff sent me the drivers for me to download. The only complaint I would have is the long waiting times. At the time the average waiting time was 9 days, I waited almost 21. Apart from that I am very happy with their service and my new laptop."

Ridiculous situation, no idea if I’m going to get my money or not. Will trade in with Apple next time even at reduced rate."

I was offered £95.00 for my Google Pixel 3, which was at least £50 more than any other trade-in site. I requested the postal form, which arrived within 3days and was effortless to assemble and to return via the post office with the pre-paid postage sticker. This took 3/4days to arrive, I then recevied the full £95 as promised within 3 working days. Faultless service!"

142227,"Disgusting and shameful service. I wouldn't even give one star if system allows. Their engineers came to install the broadband cable for BT, should call them cowboys rather than engineers. Damaged my central heating pipe which was repaired later on. To repair that they had to make a big hole in my internal wall and promised that it will be fixed. More than 3 months passed now and neither BT nor Openreach taking the responsibility. BT says it's Openreach responsibility and Openreach never responds. When ever I get a response it's the same people from both sides hence BT says we got nothing to do with Openreach. Made countless calls and loads of emails with no solution untill today. Despite me telling them again and again how dangerous it is for my family with central heating pipes being coming out of wall and any accident can happen as its my living room/Kitchen. Now I m thinking of taking them to small county claims."
116675,One of the worst service on delivery. Just eat and Uber is far better than this company of clowns. They don’t deliver and never refund money sometimes it a hassle to call and when we ask for refund they say it’s not in their hand. Also driver shortage as delivery takes always one hour sometime two hours. Cold food and they blame poor small Restaurent but their drivers are always late to collect order. They charge plus account but provide third class service. They should close their business or improve service. Worst company.
147873,"Big liar on price Mach, more than a 2 months after 5 times calls still waiting for price Mach refund.
They are always on promising but never send a refund.
Absolute time wasters. never trust them."

After being told on 2 occasions that it would be repaired, of which i never saw an engineer, i was told the 'repair' has taken too long, i would be eligible to a new machine.4 days later i phoned and eventually got through, only to be told they hadn't recieved a write off notice! I got a gift card for currys 3 days later. Took 30 days from breakdown to getting replacement. Wrote a letter to customer services asking for an explaination on 29th January, today is 25th February and surprise surprise, no response to my letter at all, not a call or e-mail even.Just goes to show how much they care about customers. If i hadn't bothered with insurance i could have bought a replacement machine the same week that mine broke down. Just as well i didn't, because i would have landed up with a gift card as opposed to real money, which i would had to spend at currys!!"

When checking my bank today they have charged me double for a split order of £377 charging me twice costing me £754. When I called them they told me it will take a few days to investigate however I need this money now for other bills and food. They have left me in an unaranged overdraft that I am being charged daily for. Left me with no money, I am so upset about this. How can they do this!"

There was 2 other cars also stuck then along came our knight in shining armour, thank you so much Stephen of Marks Electrics, he couldn’t get past any of us and the most simple thing for him would be to turn back. Instead he got all 3 cars out of the mire before turning his attention to his own delivery vehicle. What a credit he is to your company. I can’t thank him enough, certainly saved us a night on the freezing mountain. Gold star, first class. THANK YOU STEPHEN."
181206,"UPDATE - The day after the support person offered to enter into dialogue, they sent me another bill (although they confirmed my account was cancelled in Feb / 8 months ago), and a warning of debt collector! Have now spent another hour trying to get this solevd once and for all. No conclusion. Will this never end? Please don't go with Three!!! I wouldnt want this for anyone.
Don't go with Three. They follow unethical business practices and will waste your time for hours and hours on end.

I have had Three in other countries and loved them, so wanted to get them when we moved to the UK. I ordered a broadband and 2 mobile phones. After a few months of trying with boosters and with help from very friendly technical staff at three, we had to give up on the internet. They couldn't deliver the services, and kindly offered to end my contract so I could get another provider - or so I was told. Several months after I see they are still charging me (together with the phones, so didn't notice right away). When calling them to address it and get it corrected, they said it was never a broadband number so couldn't have been the case. They continued to charge me, refused to provide invoices or access to MyAccount, Still didn't cancel, so I had to stop the payments from the bank - Spent more than 35 hours on the phone with them trying to sort, and in the end they sent a debt collector. Still wont provide any paperwork for the money they have debited from my account, even thought they acknowledged on the phone that my cancellation was received months before"
135781,"I've been with talk talk for years and their service has gone from amazing to unusable so fast it is ridiculous, constant calls over months to customer service and 'technicians' which have done nothing to help with my unusable broadband have left me tethering on phone data to be able to work unless I pay a hefty cancellation fee to cancel early and then wait weeks to switch to another provider. it's gotten to the point where i've just had to file a complaint to ofcom and hope for the best. If you're going to take any advice today, avoid Talk Talk."

159569,"Disgraceful company. Ongoing problems with fridge freezer for 7 months. Paying for a care plan - unsure why. Numerous engineers called out that bad mouth the previous engineer and tell me they aren’t even fridge freezer engineers! Told by a customer service advisor that fridge freezer should be written off. Then called back to say I do not qualify for one. Spoke to manager Bethan, who told me I had to wait 5 days for another engineer. Informed her I have 2 children, I’m a key worker and have to wait 5 days in a lockdown with no fridge freezer, what does she suggest I feed my kids? She did not have an answer for me. Tried to complain numerous times, cut off after 35 mins several times. Purposely unhelpful in these already stressful times."

I had an email confirming 12 month contract and the guy said oh okay, I can put this on your account to not pay the £580, let me speak to my manager. After 5 minutes, he said he spoke to his manager and I upgraded via the TV (and it extended my contract to 2023. I had no notification that this will impact my contract or no follow up email of this change so I agreed. Now I have to pay £580. BE AWARE OF THIS!"

We had issues getting it to work and could not get through at all to very. As it was a present for an 8 year old we had to get someone to look at it. I also purchased an iPhone which also had the same issue. It was also too small for me. I have been advised that it has been received after 6 weeks and they are going to check it to see if it is intact. I am furious to say the least that they can send used or faulty items, not answer the phone to their customers and then have the ordasity to check the items I returned to see if I can have a refund! I would like someone to contact me immediately and if my iPhone is not refunded I will be taking this further. I run 2 businesses and I will never order from you again !"

160063,"One of the worst customer service ever I found in telecommunications industry. Worst and careless staff as I got sim only contract through carphone warehouse and cancelled the plan on 3rd day after I order the plan (before 14 days cooling Periods). I called and spoke with Nandy to cancel contact she said it’s okey and there will be no charge as I called within Cooling off period and even not used sim at all. Unfortunately, I received bill from service provider after 18days and they said they haven’t received cancellation request and need to pay the bill, I call back again to carphone warehouse and they said do not worry it may be a system generated bill and it will be cancelled, I never used that sim only contract and I stayed with peace of mind but after 2 months I got CCS letter from credit agency stating you got outstanding balance to recover on behalf of vodafone ??!! I called vodafone and said they haven’t got cancellations request from carphone warehouse in time that’s why they have generated bill and need to be settled down with payment. I called back to carphone warehouse, and spoke with very Rude and unprofessional staff name called “Aphiwe, she said yes it is carphone warehouse mistake not sending them cancellation request on time but that was my responsibility to call vodafone and asked final bill and send them back to claim back ?! What a rubbish service provider ?! Why should I waste my time for their mistakes ?! She hanged off the phone Rudly !! It’s really horrible service.

I will never ever go back to carphone warehouse from now on. So guys just go if you want to ruin your life."

164275,"Purchased a TV that was faulty with sound/picture being out of sync. Called for a refund as I was in my 30-day period. Sat on hold for 2 hours and 15 minutes before finally getting through to someone who ran some basic troubleshooting steps (turn off and on, factory reset etc.). Then had to be put through to another department for the actual refund... another 15 mins on hold they tell me that I have to return it to the store and they will process the refund in-store.

I asked if this was an option from the beginning and if I could have saved 3 hours of my life waiting on hold... yes it was... why wouldn't their website advise this?! Absolutely ridiculous.

If they won't/don't employ enough people to answer the phones in a reasonable timeframe then the website should list all possible options. This would both reduce the load on their - clearly understaffed - phone lines, and also improve the customer experience.

I had a bad experience with Currys 5 years ago and thought they may have improved since then, so I gave them another try. Obviously, nothing has changed and I will never, ever shop with Currys again."
195476,"Really disappointing service and products.
NOW TV is in stark contrast with other services in terms of ease of use. To use NOW TV on a PC, you need a proprietary video player. This has the bare minimum functionality and often encounters errors when playing the next episode of the show you're viewing, causing you to have to launch the website again. Just really janky and not as streamlined as other platforms.
Due to this, I purchased the NOW TV Smart Stick. The stick seldom holds connection, doesn't start up properly and requiring a click of the reset button. The dashboard suggests the episode YOU JUST WATCHED, you have to go all the way into the NOW TV > My TV > Search > Search for your show and then assuming you remember which season/episode you're on you can enjoy.
Well... not before you watch the advertisements for the service you are CURRENTLY SUBSCRIBED TO (?????)"
195468,"Upgraded from a ""steam powered "" phone which only made calls.Haven't a clue what new package does(does it make toast?) but getting used to it.Altogether a pleasant shopping experience

157750,"I wouldn't give it any star. Nightmare to get in touch with anyone. We purchased oven just before Christmas and it came damage, badly damaged. My husband called straight away Currys and the lady said that we have to wait 24h as she can't see delivery note. Few days later he tried to call but didn't connect with anyone, so after few attends we had someone on the phone fallowing day. They offered us different oven which supposed to be £30 cheaper plus £30 compensation plus manager supposed to call us in 24h/43h which didn't happen. SO the new receipt come today telling us that the oven cost exactly the same as the previous one and there was nothing about compensation so again my husband called Currys waiting long time to be connected with someone and the other person wasn't helpful at all, he couldn't access the receipt, and he couldn't answer my husband questions. He asked if he can talk to manages but again he told us that someone will call back in next 24/43h. We ended returning the item without exchange. Online purchases are nightmare with Currys. Customer service looks like people without any knowledge."

129016,"BT may spend millions in marketing, hiring expensive Hollywood stars to attract customers but the generated leads are so badly followed up and so badly looked after that no customers in their own mind would have the confidence to join BT, at least that's been my personal experience.
I may be biased because I remember the excellent BT customer services of 30 years ago."

Lost an important appointment and luckily I had Wi-Fi to contact them they asked me for proof of address I don’t travel with my bills! Go with a different provider besides the network it’s very bad for signal only cheaper that’s all

138751,"Fitted oven element that failed within what they stated as a 12 month warranty. Contacted their support and you are basically run round in rings, where you have to find replacement part number (for discontinued parts), send things back unused and in original packaging and send it back with a prepaid postage label that they don't send you. They refused to give any contact to call, and will not refer to a manager. This sounds like an offshore email chat centre and there are no phone numbers to complain to. Used them over the years but no more."

106720,"Absolute shambles trying to get a new fibre line installed with BT. I booked my installation weeks in advance to coincide with the end of my existing provider. I followed the pre-installation checklists they sent to the letter. My engineer arrives an hour early for the Friday afternoon slot -- brilliant, I think -- and then the problems begin. Apparently as I own a leasehold first-floor flat he needs some permission from his manager to drill a hole or something. I leave him to it -- he says he's calling his manager. Then that his manager is calling their manager. Then he says that he's waiting for his manager to get back to him, he'll pop off to do another nearby job and return after that. He'll call me when he's on his way round in case I need to take the dog out. Then, nothing. I wait in all afternoon, then I try calling his mobile several times between 5 and 6pm -- no answer. At this point I'm both furious and in despair as my current connection gets cut off at midnight, and I have an online work conference to attend all weekend and am due to be working from home (online) as of Monday. I called BT customer service and they said they can't do anything until after 6pm. I called after 6pm and after going through security got cut off. No-one called me back. I called again and waited on hold for ages but had to leave for a prior appointment before I could get through.
On Saturday morning, I called customer service again, to be told that I could rebook for two weeks' time. I said that wasn't a viable option for me -- I cannot be without internet for two weeks as that means I cannot work. Apparently there's nothing they can do, despite, I understand, Openreach being a subsidiary of BT and my having been stood up by the engineer. It turns out they needed 'permission' from the ground floor flat, and as the occupants happened to not be in when the engineer knocked on their door at midday on Friday, that was that. I should talk to them to get permission. I explained I'd already done that earlier in the week -- the engineer had never asked me about this nor communicated any of this to me. I asked to speak to the person's manager in a futile attempt to get internet installed without having to wait two weeks. Manager not in until Tuesday -- they will call me then. Ridiculous. I left it that I was cancelling my order.
Since then, I've had once missed call from a London number on Tuesday (customer services manager?), and have received a confirmation of my new installation date in two weeks' time along with a permission form from Openreach that I'd have to print out and get the GFF to sign. I don't have a printer, and I'd cancelled my order.
In order to be able to do my job, I reactivated my previous provider's line and am now tied into an 18-month contract with them."

174061,"I've used Team Knowhow (previously Geek Squad) for 14 years. For 12 of those years I was a business owner working in my own home. These guys were my IT department. I literally wouldn't have managed some situations without them. Knowing that I could call 24/7 with any issue - sometimes substantial, sometimes embarrassingly small - and have a super-patient, super-knowledgeable, super-helpful agent log in and resolve the problem has always been - and continues to be - invaluable.
I recommend Team Knowhow to everyone I know.They're brilliant!!"

189957,"I ordered a tumble dryer that I couldn't collect from the store so it had to be delivered, not a problem except curry's charge me £20 for something I would have preferred to collect myself. Then they delivered a faulty machine and to date I am still waiting for the machine. I live 5 minutes from my local store so £20 for a 3 mile drive is really expensive."
137157,"Standard delivery option cost 3.50, took three days to dispatch and yodel failed to deliver on arranged date (""couldnt find the address"" - however, amazon, dpd, ups all have had no issues over many deliveries).
Adding insult to injury by spamming me with review request before the item has even dispatched, the fact that e-buyer charge multiple delivery costs for two order made to same address within minutes.
I stopped using ebuyer couple of years back, because of unreialb edelivery and poor stock choices- made mistake of trying again - wont be continuing to buy from ebuyer."
195665,"Here is why this TV service is trash:

- Extra charge for ""HD"" is laughable in 2021 when 4K is now standard
- Pricey for the content they have I mean costs more than Netflix?!? Really?!?
- No real support - you can use their crappy live chat
- Billing system is not reliable
- Customers are getting charged even after cancelling and the process itself is more complicated than it needs to be
- UI doesn't remember where you left off
- Search is trash you can't find anything by actor
- Apps don't have any data saving controls

Oh HBO, please will you realise what you've done and drop these thieves and bring us HBO Max!

If you ain't convinced, read the rest of the reviews here.
Nuff said.

Can't comment on their broadband, but that also seems to be the same trash service. AVOID!!"

152609,"Consistently awful on the customer services front, and consistently poor quality broadband and phone. Today's difficulty was that my answering machine picked up a message saying that my email account was about to be deleted. I've been a customer for 35 years, and investigation showed my account was in credit. Getting through to customer service for email was impossible, phone link just dropped out. However when I keyed in 6 (hope that's useful info) for ""thinking of switching provider"" the person who answered said that this call was a ""scam"". Why then, coincidentally, could I not access my email?? Then I was transferred onto a new plan, costing £10 per month more than a new customer pays.
Still no answer forthcoming about where all my emails had gone. Luckily, the details of my new deal are going to be emailed to me!!!!! That'll come in very handy."
191954,Rozia was the soul of helpfulness. When you get through to tech support the service is fine. The phone queuing is lengthy though.
119257,"Quick quote based upon my description, amount agreed. Item sent and quality checked money received same day. Simple operational model when described here - but I have no doubt serious hard work makes the customer experience seem easy. Thanks for the simplicity for me."
145451,I have ordered a phone while there was promotional offer of £100 extra with trade in. Its over 2 months but haven’t received my £100 for trade in promotion. I have contacted (email+ telephone)customer service multiple times with no luck. Every time i contact them got same answer trade in team will be in touch shortly (3-5 working days). you are treated nice until you have made payment then you are nothing for them. The company is total scam please avoid.

184880,"If I could give them 0 stars I would.
Signed a contract for broadband £39 a month, got the contract in writing and then all of a sudden they charge me £47?
I ask them why and they cant tell me why, they apologise and say we reimburse you and next month will be the correct amount. 3 months have gone by, no reimbursement and 3 x £47 monthly charges. Next move will be the Ombudsman."

Just 1 remark only : custom cost that I never paid before for delivery to Italy."
196005,"Joined them solely to get an esim for Apple Watch after checking their website that said in two places how to get it. Spoke to an support advisor who said yes it will be activated when my sim is switched on.
Sim arrived and couldn’t connect the watch. Spoke to another advisor who said they activated it and will take 1-2 hours. Again it didn’t work.
Spoke to a third advisor who said they were not available who put me onto a fourth advisor who said no they arnt released yet.

Asked for a pac code and that hasn’t gone through. I give up with this company. Nothing but incompetence. All Indian support staff who don’t give a damn.

Avoid like the plague."
194345,"I couldnt be happier with the service recieved from Lina today! I called to order an Iphone 12 Pro Max and later recieved confirmation that I was infact recieving the smaller verision (my error). I imediatley went in to panic and called Carphone Warehouse back. I was passed from A to B to C before Lina was refound and thanfully called me back. She dealt with the problem for me with extreme speed and politness, I am very grateful for Lina's help today! Great Customer Service! THANKS AGAIN LINA!"
157184,My father who is a pensioner phone wont work. He has sent Now TV 4 emails with no reply. I called them and could only get through on the cancel my account mmmmmm. They wont speak to me even though I only want to report a fault. They said get your dad to call. OMG HIS PHONE IS NOT WORKING AND HE HAS NO MOBILE.
146161,Complete waste of time. Trying to get a day pass for hours before a live event that I was waiting for a very long time to come. Then it just says something went wrong and they can't process the day pass. Then I can't sign into my account as it keeps saying it does not recognise my email or password on their website however signing into the app was fine!!! I can only get the passes from the website which is utterly stupid. Then trying to file a complaint the website of theirs chooses the categories and answers for you. You can't even write your complaint yourself. Let alone it takes you in circles so you just give up and don't put the complaint at all. I have been using them for a while and I know many many people who use it. I for one will stop using it now and the 20+ people who I know that use it will stop using this now. Utter rubbish
129851,"I was overcharged by over £1,100 by Three for a contract I ended with them. They never even cancelled it, admitted the error (first of several), and promised me a refund. This was months ago.

They acknowledged that they owed me a large refund, but consistently delayed in paying me. The first excuse they had for the delay was that I needed to cancel the contract again, officially, and wait for my next billing date. Fine. I waited, and after the date, heard nothing from Three.

So I called again, was initially told by them that they didn't owe me anything, before they eventually admitted that they still owed me over £1,100, and to wait 3-5 working days for it. Okay.

3-5 days later, nothing. So I call again - please wait 3-5 more working days. 3-5 more days, and again, nothing.

After calling them yet again and practically begging for the money they owed me, they told me there was a human error with processing the refund, and they will need to retry it. They hadn't told me this, and apparently were just waiting for me to call after not getting the money. Told to wait yet again for the money, which didn't arrive in the time they said it would.

Months later, I finally have my refund. I have received less than nothing from Three in terms of service. I was calling them twice a week, and basically begging for my money back, just to hear the same scripted answer that always turned out to be untrue. This went on for months. Zero communication from them, nothing they promised happened.

I won't even mention the absolutely terrible signal because other reviews seem to have that covered. If you're ever in a major city - just don't expect any coverage at all. My phone often tells me I have 5G, but isn't able to even load an email. This is always the case for my Three mobile whenever I am in London. I have to use my work phone, which has BT Mobile, whenever I'm travelling, which has zero problems. Paying a couple of pounds more per month to another provider is not just worth it - it's basically essential if you ever actually want to use your phone.

From now on, if I dislike someone, I will simply avoid them. But if I hate someone, I will recommend Three to them. Avoid this company at all costs, and if your contract ends with them, IT IS ESSENTIAL that you contact your bank and make sure they are blocked from taking any more money on the DD. Otherwise, like me, they will just keep charging you. And it will take you months of stress to get it back.

I am sure I will receive an automated copy+paste response telling me to get in touch with somebody, etc. I don't care. I have included my Three account details with this review. They can contact me directly if they want to make amends. Their way of saying sorry to me, after all this, and after I insisted they compensate me, was to give me 50% off my standard bill rate, for one month."
187453,Excellent service. Quick delivery.
146890,"Purchased a battery on 2/12/22,after waiting over two weeks for DX Couriers to deliver the battery which had become lost or stolen in the DX depot as driver had scanned it but forgot to put it in the van for delivery. I asked Tayna batteries for a refund only to be told that they had asked DX Couriers to return the battery to them and when Tayna had confirmation it was on it's way back to them then only then would they issue me a refund.
Open the case with Paypal and got issued a refund today,22/12/22."
136103,Item arrived quickly. The fan was fairly easy to construct. The water container for misting could have been designed a little better and would advise anyone buying this to have an old towel handy for top ups as there will be water in the unit where the water container is housed and you can use the towel to wipe down the container once re-filled. My wife loved the fan itself and its helping her sleep on warm nights. She does find normal mode the best as the sleep mode she found to be a little noisy. Overall a good product though and would recommend.
166778,"The person who dealt with my enquiry on the phone was very helpful, pleasant and polite. Checked stock was in and explained the 6-year warranty clearly. He also explained that the call-recording was turned off during card-payment which was reassuring. The order went through easily and delivery was even sooner than was suggested. All in all, very good service. Thank you."
181421,From dropping my phone & cracking the screen to writing this review was less than 24 hours! Lovely lady at customer services made the claim process incredibly easy - I must admit to being a bit dubious about the fast replacement offer but DPD turned up with a nice brand new shiny phone the very next day! Amazingly good service!
151346,"I bought a TV and paid for next-day delivery, the next day I got a message saying my delivery had been delayed. More than a week later still haven't received any updates or estimated delivery date.

192840,Quick service and great product which works well

104452,Very professional and safe site to sell your old phone. As soon as they received the phone in less than 24hrs I received the payment.I suggest to all my friends to use a safe site than selling private in order to avoid scammers.
137012,"I am pleased with GHP. Bought product on the 18th of December for Xmas gift, took 5 days to process my order. Was a bit afraid that I wouldn't getting in time, but eventually I did received it on the 22th. Product is high quality!"
124681,We sat waiting in with outside lights on and two dogs who bark and the delivery driver Scott claimed he’d turned up but we couldn’t answer the door. If he’d knocked even quietly the dogs would have barked. Next day driver was faultless.
136956,"Harry was VERY helpful at the shop in Cheltenham. However, there was NO contact when they tried to deliver my laptop so I wasn’t in for their first try and the second time it was just luck that I was around!

186907,"Paid for delivery between 1pm - 5pm. Called at 5pm to chase the delivery only for them to tell me delivery was likely to be 7pm! So I couldn't cook dinner for my baby, and we'd then expect a delivery at her bedtime.

Delivery then turned up just after 6pm after I'd then cancelled my evening plans. I'd had an electrician around from 5pm waiting to fit the cooker too.

Basically, due to Curry's bad planning, the cooker cost me an extra £50+ in cancelled gym classes, cancelled babysitters and delayed electricians. Will be ordering from ao next time!"
173443,Quick and efficient reply. Part arrived promptly
108206,Polite pair of guys and quite helpful this morning but they did damage a cup holder on my garden furniture which he took pictures of and logged it. There was plenty of room too… I will contact Curry’s and report this with pictures.. we will see if the product is any good over the next few weeks…
114124,The app is understandable and easy to use. Great information!
179789,Great sales staff. Sale went in straight away. Waited about 5 minutes for the washing machine. They put it into my car. All polite and efficient.

166846,"I took out a 1 month contract for a WiFi dongle. On all of my correspondence and order information it states this is a 30 day contract.

During this ‘1 month’ contract I have been unable to view my plan or my bill on the My Vodafone app or when logging into the Vodafone website.

Fast forward to 30 days later and I received a text message from Vodafone to notify me of my next bill date… Strange I thought as I had taken out a 1 month contract as advertised so I decided to contact Vodafone via their online chat.
This process was painful and I wasted over 2 hours of my life on this and was also cut off at one point so had to rejoin the queue to speak to an advisor.

Upon speaking to the 3rd and final advisor (I was passed from department to department) I was advised that my contract was a rolling contract and I had to give 30 days notice to cancel it. The first thing I find strange is that there is literally no mention of this online nor on my order information. The contract does not state that it is in fact a rolling contract. The second thing that is beyond my belief is that Vodafone expect customers to take out a 1 month contract and then cancel it immediately otherwise you are purchasing something that you did not intend to purchase.

Vodafone are misleading customers and advertising their products in an untruthful way. They are relying on customers being unaware they are actually entering a rolling contract (despite it being advertised as a 1 month contract) and then being stuck in the contract for longer than intended.

Vodafone’s ‘fix’ for my issue was that they would cancel my contract with immediate notice resulting in me paying for part of the extra month’s bill. This ‘fix’ however was not offered immediately and they originally expected me to give them from 30 days notice from today.

I would not recommend Vodafone and feel the way they mislead their customers is disgraceful. After having this issue and researching it it appears that other people have had the same issue; some on 12 month contracts whom assumed would just last the 12 months and some similar to my situation.

Avoid at all costs."

147376,"Faulty router needed to be replaced, told it would arrive on a certain date. It didn't. Called back, they blamed DPD and Queens death.Turns out they never sent it due to a technical issue. Apparently it can't be fixed so they had to request to cancel that request and put through another and wait 48hrs. After 48hrs turns out they made an error on the request so it didn't go through. Another 48 hours, the back office team ask if I received the item, bear in mind the replacement was never sent and they should already know that or could have easily checked, so back to waiting another 48hrs just to cancel a request that is stuck due to a technical issue they are aware of. Pretty poor service for what should be a simple resolution."

Rejected the offer obviously, they then upped the offer to just under 200 but I still rejected. They sent it back in a simple cardboard box which got dumped through the letter box with absolutely zero care. Thank goodness I’m not desperate for money so I didn’t get swindled by these con artists."

I have never ever heard of a more ridiculous clause in my life. I was told that its automated, but still unbelievable. I have managed to get a refund as I was 2 hours late cancelling it and hadn't used the account but still very very unimpressed. I didn't find the app had much to offer either which is a shame but that's why I wanted to use the 7 day trail (which is tight most places give you more). Anyway not for me, wish I had checked reviews before hand."
109462,"I just spoke to customer services requesting a solution to the changes on roaming charges, which are 2£ a day when you are in any European country (giff gaff offers this free of charge up to 20GB). I previously signed a contract where I had free roaming, but a few months ago I saw myself requiring more GB a month and upgraded to 100, now they tell me when I upgraded I lost my free roaming!! I hadn't been told this was happening, which I find disgustingly sneaky and careless not to warn about this important change. Now I have to remain on this contract till it's finished and say bye bye forever to Vodafone. The solution they offer is I pay 150£ for a new phone and include roaming which is ridiculous. I got this phone 1 year and 7 months ago. Avoid Vodafone!!!"

181553,"Now, my experience was a little rough seeing as i was waiting for a month before my custom built pc was even being built. Overall It took 24 working days in order for my pc to be dispatched and that was a day before my birthday, I did mention my birthday to customer service so I don't know if the delivery was altered but if it was you're amazing. It came first thing in the morning.

Besides the long wait, after I got in contact with customer service they weren't sure exactly when the pc would be built. Christmas rush etc so I can understand, this being said the pc was built, tested and dispatched within 4 days regardless of it being delayed.

The reason I'm giving a 5* and not a 4 or a 3 is because of the service, I was greeted with politeness and kindness. The service advisor I spoke to, Thomas, was fantastic.

I would definitely order from PC Specialist again, maybe not during the Christmas rush next time though."
190361,"I chose this company because the price was good. They asked me for the model so they could see if they had what I needed. I told them. They then asked for a serial number, which I gave them. They then told me, sorry, they couldn't tell me. Chocolate teapot came to mind. Anyway, I took a punt and plumped for one that looked right. It was. Good for me. 4 stars because I wouldn't choose this company if I really didn't know the details of the part I needed."

I complained that the parcel has not been delivered and Ebuyer took yodel points of view even though they never provided evidence of the parcel infront of my door or doorway. Ebuyer just past the message along to Yodel instead of representing me as their customer. I’m not Yodel’s customer, I’m Ebuyer customer.

Last two weeks I have called shell energy and received appalling service. Shell you need to retrain your staff. People you put on your call centres are not able to help neither they have access to a manager who can support them. The query was as simple as setting up a new account as the previous account holder has left. The question the team continued to ask was well if you are not a account holder I cannot speak to you ! Really Shell - retrain! And have access to supervisors from 8 am ! Plus respond to the changing circumstances if I have sent you details of my ownership two weeks ago, my account should have been set up by now!"

Dominic, clearly has no product knowledge as he sold us the complete wrong phone we asked for in the beginning. And for Tom the assistant Manager well he was extremely rude and very unhelpful. Due to the catastrophic mix up at tbt e beginning We went back to the store to resolve another use eye that had arisen due to the handset being faulty. Tom didn’t want to help and didn’t even try to save the fact we asked for a refund even after we suggested other phones.

Overall the experience was horrendous and I will never be doing business with Caroline warehouse ever again and I will not recommend them to anyone ever!"

And instantly I regretted it and started panicking, when I tell you I felt like such a mug it was mad.

I even contacted my bank.... all for it to turn up on the 6th day! And the RELIEF and GRATITUDE I felt hahahaha. But yeah I did feel stupid because everything turned out as it should. The phone was in great condition like advertised and it still is now as I’m writing this review off it.

-Quality phone
-Speedy delivery
-Good customer service (could do with phone calls though ;)

152588,Shell closed my complaint regarding inaccurate billing unresolved and without my consent. Numerous complaints over past 10 weeks with same outcome. I have been billed £539.24 on 16/9/22 which has been corrected from a previous bill of £997.04 on 12/8/22. I dispute this bill. Total energy use according to their own billing is £2257.24. Minus my payments of £2152.61 as detailed above shows that I owe Shell £103.63. I am requesting a letter of deadlock in order to pursue this through the ombudsman. communications via phone have proved ineffective in the past. Avoid Shell if you can. I had no choice as I was with Green previously. I am now with UW but this situation remains unresolved and it has caused me many a sleepless night 😡

To date I have still not had the phone repaired or returned. I keep getting fobbed off with delaying tactics, and has got to the stage where I have requested a refund. This is now going through the Small Claims Court, and will also be reported to BBC Watchdog. Steer well clear of Quick Mobile Fix!

Even the local Three store suggested I switch networks.
Thought things finally were resolved when I started getting 5g service, but then that stopped after several months.

All I get from Three is that there are no issues.

112045,"The idea of being able to buy a day, week or month pass is on the face of it amazing, I really liked the idea of hand picking individual games or weeks of sport without going into a full contract and as a football fan I would be ablate ignore the off season and lack of sport to appeal to me. I bought a few day and week passes with no issues until last month when I bought a month pass, little did I know that NOW TV renew these passes without your permission and you physically have to cancel the pass or end up in a subscription.

HOWEVER, it gets worse, I read reviews here and cancelled my pass prior to it expiring, NOW TV however allegedly didn't receive my cancellation and renewed the pass a couple of days after cancelling it, as soon as the money left my account I contacted them through online chat to be told I couldn't get a refund! After many emails I finally gave up and claimed the money back through my bank.
I will NEVER use this company again, they renew set passes without your permission and hold on to your money, you can't close the account so I have blocked all further payments."

I sent it back for repair and they replaced the main board and 2 weeks later they returned it. It now has a permanent green line going all the way down the screen about 10 inches from the left hand side. Their quality control is seriously lacking. It has now been booked in for repair for a 3rd time. They won't replace the TV until it's been in for repair 3 times. I am so frustrated and disappointed in Currys and would never dream of buying from them again. Appalling service. Not only that but they managed to lose the legs and the polystyrene packaging from the box. A complete casual disregard for their customer's property."

Noone replied until weeks later, bearing in mind this is all prior to Covid-19. They accepted this and advised a cheque ( No, they do NOT refund to your card!) Will be issued in 28 days... the date is now April 29th and after follow up emails AND calls.... Nothing. Today I asked to be put through to make a complaint, having again spoken to someone who couldn't assist except to tell me the plan has been cancelled, my call has been cut off!!!

193636,"I am returning to this review to say that whilst it was annoying to have to deal with the issue at hand the resolution offered by Marks was extremely fair. We were able to return the Delonghi cooker in exchange for a Rangemaster. We received a full refund and an unexpected discount to match the original discount given on the Dehlonghi. We were able to exchange the extended warranty and upgrade to a new one.

So a pain, but at least we ended up with a very fair resolution.


I bought a DeLonghi cooker with an extended warranty offering 'Total cover for total peace of mind' and a promise that 'If we can't repair it we'll replace it'
18 months later and the main oven has now been broken for 9 weeks! There was a botched attempt to repair it, then the last engineer didn't even look inside before leaving saying he wasn't able to repair it. Marks Electrical tell me to talk with DeLonghi..and DeLonghi tell me to talk with Marks electrical. Totally rubbish experience, no one want's to take responsibility. The offer is clear - 'If we can't repair it we'll replace it' We bought the cooker AND the warranty from Marks Electrical so Marks Electrical should be sorting this out. I'm also fed up waiting c40 Minutes every time I want to talk to anyone! I have a call this week with the legal advice team at Which? Consumer Magazine. That's how frustrated I am!
PLEASE! Live up to your promise to 'Repair or Replace'"

145990,"Should be no stars. I can't believe now how curry's get away with miss selling this ""cover"". Our washing machine has broken down 4 times now. Each time we wait 3 weeks before anyone is sent to look at it. Last time we were told it would be replaced if it happened again. It did, and our utility room is now damaged. Skirting board has come off warped and wall tiles are damaged. We have waited since the start of January to have it replaced. They didn't even come to look at it for weeks. Then wanted another assessor to look at it to sign off on replacing it. That was weeks ago and we are still waiting. When we bought this cover we were told 21 days repair or replace. If it can't be fixed in 3 weeks you get a new machine. A family of 5, 2 months
with no washing machine and flood damage to our home as a result. When on the phone they asked us to try and put it on again to see what happens? So flood our home even further. Ridiculous and no remotely helpful support staff. Every phone call is an argument as they play dumb. We took out this cover on all our appliances. Our hoover also broke previously. After 3 weeks it still sat behind the tills in the shop where I dropped it off for collecting. We had such hassle getting a resolution on that occasion too."

114098,"Black Friday is on and lots of good deals to claim out there. I placed a new order for a phone, which initially was on the Vodafone network. I get an email saying they need more info. Sure thing. I give them a ring and they basically just say there are some issues with the card which I figured came from having just moved. Still, fair enough, but then it starts... They are reluctant to let me sort it out with them simply by changing billing details, they tell me they are running checks which are taking longer than usual and will call me back in 20-60 minutes. I leave them to it and wait for a call. 24 hours later I call them back after having heard nothing. This guy seems borderline upset with me for asking what the problem is and once again asking to change the details before running through checks so it'll match up (card to address). He just says he can't do it and I eventually give up. I receive an email shortly after saying order has been cancelled. I try placing the order again but will all the correct details and this time almost immediately get an email saying the order has been cancelled. This time no follow up calls, emails needing more info or anything, they just cancelled it.

They had told me on the phone earlier we could simply do another network, so that's what I did. I placed the order again, this time through O2 who had a similar deal, not to mention I've been a customer with them for 3 years so any checks on me would pass with flying colours. However, immediately I receive another email that my order has been cancelled.

Whether they recognised me and just decided to not pass the order through I have no idea, but there is no reason I should have had to go through all this and in the end not get the deal I was looking for.

Steer clear..."

Waited 6 weeks for installation of broadband for the engineer to come out and say he can’t access even though he could. Got the impression he fancied a long weekend as it’s a sunny Friday.

Rang CS and they were they were unable to give any sort of timescale for resolution of the complaint or even first contact following the complaint being logged and when I probed this I was passed into a ping pong between departments still coming out none the wiser.

Needless to say broadband has now been cancelled."

174361,"I had an ongoing issue with a Sony HT-A9 which I had purchased from RSounds and it being out of sync with respect to picture and sound. I had several very lengthy phone calls to Sony to try to resolve this issue, which they were unable to resolve.

I eventually called Richer Sounds to see if they had any idea of how to resolve my issues, I was offered some very simple things to try within the TV settings, and within seconds, this issue was fixed. I was very surprised that Sony only considered the Sony product in isolation, but thanks to the tenacity and experience of the likes of Danny at Richer sounds in customer and technical help, Danny had the months old problem fixed in seconds.

I called Danny for help on Friday 6th January and Danny kindly called me back as he said he would on Monday 9th January to make sure my issue was fully resolved. I think Danny went above and beyond to make sure not only was the issue resolved but also to make sure I was satisfied with the RS service, which I certainly am, so a big appreciation to Danny, much deserved, thank you."

When I’ve checked on the online quick check it states there is no issue and I’m unable to book a technician to support. Trying to contact anyone to support is a nightmare as is trying to raise a formal complaint. I think it’s ridiculous I’m paying full price for a service that stops working for days/weeks. I have a very important interview for a new job this week which I’ll be unable to complete now as I have no internet connection. I’ve been told the issue may be fixed by the 21st Nov, that’s 6 days with no service. I’m appalled by this."

I have broadband and phone, get 50Mb download speed all the time pretty well, and with 3 of us on Netflix or similar at the same time, not a stutter. I think the problem with Trustpilot reviews is that as soon as a consumer gets a problem, they whizz off to leave a very negative review, whereas there is no reminding mechanism to record good reviews. Result: unrepresentative, and skewed ratings. TRUSTPILOT: ARE YOU READING THIS? (Incidentally, Trustpilot, great service on other sectors/companies - a big thanks)"

124477,"If I could give minus stars I would.

Both BT and openreach are completely incompetent.

I recently moved home to a semi detached house. The area I live in has had the benefit of most properties being on a full fibre to premises upgrade. As a result the tenants before me took advantage of this and had FFTP broadband prior to me moving in. As a result I have the fibre infrastructure running around the outside of my house. The same cabling supplies the neighbours next door. My broadband was originally with sky and as I wanted to moved my TV services I decided I would move my broadband aswell. I place an order to move my sky and TV services back in January and was given an activation date of the 1st of February.

After not hearing much from sky about the broadband I called them. They said that openreach had to do some external works and these works would not be completed until the 21st of February. This date pasted and still nothing. I phone sky numerous times but they could not seem to get real information from openreach about the delays.

I decided to cancel my order with sky and place one with BT. My thinking was that openreach is owned by BT and they might be able to give me more answers about the delays and what exactly needed to be done. I was told upgrades needed to be done to the exchange. Fair enough. I rang BT 2 weeks ago and asked if all external work had been completed and the install date was to go ahead. I was told yes and the router was sent out a few days before the install date.

After recieving no word on the day of install, for which I had taken a day off work for I phoned BT. After they looked into the order I was told openreach had asked them to reschedule the install but BT hadn't bothered to take time out of their day to do so and no one had contacted me.

Openreach is a law onto itself as it owns the entire broadband network in this country apart from what is owned by virgin. It really shouldn't be allowed the monopoly it is given if it can't manage it.

It's pretty plain to see from the reviews on here that BT has poor service levels. Might explain why openreach is so poor at its job given BT is its parent company.

I've been without broadband for over two months now. In a property that had FFTP a few months ago and every property in a 2 mile radius has."
167653,"Absolutely shocking! I had disrupted service for over a month back in April - and it took BT 4 different complaints from my side, and around 3 engineer visits to sort it out!
I am owed compensation and I am struggling since 01.07.2021 to get this paid - and I am being told '7 working days', '5 working days' , '10 working days' every time I speak to someone. Absolute joke, sort your customer service out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I stayed with BT because I was promised good service, and this is an ABSOLUTE JOKE!!!!!"
108044,"Just had the most horrendous upgrade experience to Virgin 360. Sales told me I was getting a free O2 pay as you go Sim with my new contract which I didn’t need (I have a Virgin phone contract already!!) then I discovered he had signed me up for a £30 contract with O2.
The “simple” upgrade I was told to do myself totally failed and left me with no channels for 5 days until an engineer came and swapped my boxes. I lost all my recorded programs, and was then left missing a subset of channels which I finally got sorted 5 days later. Then after hours on the phone to Virgin and two engineer visits I have been told that I cannot speak to anyone in the company about compensation for loss of service because a computer makes the decision about when I have lost service. I am speechless - no-one could fix my problems remotely in spite of hours on the phone so how on earth can a computer make a decision about my customer journey. I tried to log a complaint over the phone but was told I have to do it in writing, even though the website says phone to complain?!
23rd Nov - thanks Virgin. After your useful feedback below I tried contacting you via all the routes suggested except Twitter which I don’t have. All routes failed miserably. Hours trying online chat, another phone call and a promised call back which yet again never happened. Your customer service is broken and you have only called me when you want me to buy something. Thank goodness for the two engineers who came out after I personally arranged visits. Without them I’d still have no TV service. V360 has now given us a poorer service with reduced functionality particularly on our second box.
I have two phone contracts, TV, BB and phone with you. At contract end they are all going- I will never let you lure me in again (for the sake of my mental health)"

188229,"I bought a vacuum on the 23rd December 2021. It had broke about 11 months in (Under a 1 year warranty) (the warranty is with Argos). I reported it broke within the year.

Now when i phoned Argos. The first girl Chloe told me she would phone me back. She never did. Phoned again myself and the guy who answered said contact the manufacturer.

What is the point of having a warranty yourselves if you fob us off to the manufacturer? Don't bother taking their warranty into account with your purchase as they do not stand by it.

The guy kept repeating contact the manufacturer. I told him i have and they haven't got back to me. He just kept repeating it. Honestly i work for EE customer services and i am in shock at the state of Argos ""customer services""

Stick by your warranty or don't sell items under the promise of one.

Sort your customer services training out. Its a disgrace. Fobbing people off with promised call backs and telling them to go to the manufacturer is unacceptable.

UPDATE: Argos is just bad customer service all around"
160022,"So where do i start, i was due an upgrade on my phone contract and therefore i went online and ordered my new one with Carphone Warehouse. A day later my phone was delivered only to then realise they had taken out a second contract for the phone and not upgraded the contract i already had. So I then had to physically return this phone to the shop to them whilst a second phone was ordered and delivered as an upgrade on my original contract. When I took the first phone back into the shop to return to them they then ended up cancelling my second phone order by mistake so I then had to get my second phone which had already been delivered by this point and physically return this one to the shop as well!!! Nightmare!!! At this point i was then told by Carphone Warehouse i could not ordered another phone as of yet and had to wait 3-5 days because the system was showing me as already upgraded (even though they had cancelled this). By the time i came to ordering my third phone with Carphone Warehouse the tariff i had originally chosen on the first and second phone was no longer available and the only tariffs available on the network and phone i wanted were dearer and cost more. At this point i am livid and refusing to pay more than what i wanted as this is there error and not mine. Eventually Carphone Warehouse agreed that if i get the higher tariff they will refund me the difference of what i was going to pay. This worked out that Carphone Warehouse are to refund me £240. They advised me to stay in my contract 30 days with the new phone and then they will send the money to me. It has now been nearly 2 months or more and i still haven't received the £240 refund they owe me. I have been on the phone to them countless times and each time i am lied to and fobbed off. I have been told on more than one occasion that a cheque has been raised for me when it turns out it actually hasn't, i have been told i will have to wait a further 14-28 days for the cheque which i have advised is not acceptable and not willing to accept as i have already waited well over 30 days or more and i have also been told that instead they have now authorised a bank transfer for me straight to my bank and i should receive this by the end of the week. Surprise surprise still no money!!! This is an absolute joke!!! What an absolute shabby, fraudulent, thieving company. If i do not get my money within the next 24hours i will be making sure this goes higher than just a trust pilot review and i will take it to every Ombudsman interested and any Newspaper interested in your fraudulent and dodgy ways!!!"

What started as a genuine mistake, I went to shop to pick up phone but couldn't because I didn't have my husbands card. So I had to cancel that order and buy another phone there in the store. Fine. Expecting us to get a refund asap as of course I couldn't take the original order. A week later no refund, went back to store they say only after 14 days. Fine. Another 2 weeks go by still no refund. Chat online with customer ""service"" was told they can only issue a cheque in another 14 days! I said unacceptable they said I need to go back to store. Branch manager next day says they can't do anything I need to call customer service again! So call back and suddenly they tell me I should expect refund today! To the bank directly! But guess what... Nothing received no money in bank. So call back again and now they tell me it was only processed last Friday so can take 3 to 5 days!!!!! Never again."
175519,"Have not recieved order. Even though I asked for it be sent by Fed Ex. Which shows incompitance on the side of CEX with these strikes. As soon as the strikes were made public. CEX should have sent every order by Courier and not be post where there are delays. I sure the entire UK agrees with me on this True Fact.
i WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF CEX loses customers. For past 2 work days my order been stationary in PSC Atherstone.

There are no wise managers at cex. The customer needs to come first. IF the customer came first then products would have been sent by courier no matter the how much spent on product by customer. It is principle;
A customer that spends 250 on a product which is nex day delivered by courier. Will nect time spend 1000 or more on a product.

A few weeks ago the unit collapsed and crushed my fingers while I was putting a fire stick in it and running the wire in the compartment at the back you could see that the metal had sheared and how it was still standing before I have no idea. Contacted Argos for a replacement or refund. They immediately got their hazardous items team to contact me which I was surprised at and made me concerned but I answered all their questions I sent them all the past and present images then they wanted the item to check it here in the UK so I packed it all for them and they had it collected by Royal Mail. Ever since complete silence no acknowledgment of receipt of the item no calls no emails no letters just a silence. UPDATE 01/11/22 made me an offer of money or a full refund voucher. They stated that there was no issue with the item that it was not faulty which i appreciated but if there is not an issue why make me an offer. I declined their offers and asked for my item back so i could have an independent engineering report done. They have refused to return my item, they said it is now in Turkey awaiting a report. Do you see the contradiction. Argos I want my item back I have emailed you with 30 days in which to do this, that is a reasonable time. What is important is not the money but the fact you may have sold an item that caused me injury and therefore could to others.
Update: I see Argos have replied, you already have my order number if you bothered to look at the details filled out on Trustpilot."

Not so Carphone Warehouse apparently. We reserved a phone to collect from their Coalville office and when I got there the phone didn't exist. Moreover although they had 10 more in stock they couldn't give me one even though the company had my money. All their click and collects are posted separately to the shop via DPD and you can only get the one in the post because that's ""yours"".

After nearly an hour in the shop it turned out the phone had been posted to another shop in Essex 120 miles away.. They still couldn't give me a phone and we were forced to wait a week for the original phone to be re-posted to Leicestershire.

The staff were not even surprised. They just said ""It's best to just come in and buy one"" and ""We had one turn up in Leeds last week"" but that, of course, is not the message you get from their website.

I'd used one of their most well known competitors to sell 2 very good condition Iphone 11's for £190 each. When the other company received the phone they claimed there were more than 5 large scratches on each phone as well as chips and camera issues. Absolute nonsense.

Anyway, I got my phones back in the post (eventually) by which point the average price had dropped, so tried Envirofone as they had much better reviews.
Once evaluated they sent the full £180 for each phone! Was definitely nervous about getting the same response, but these people seem much more honest!"

163825,"Just completed an early upgrade with car phone warehouse, £200.00 which I knew and was happy with. ( the cost is not the issue) The problem is with their courier service DPD. I was informed the phone would be delivered Fri 14th June 19 (ordered placed Wed eve 12th June) as the phone must be signed for I waited in all day, despite numerous calls to DPD for information, at 13:00 I got told they would be unable to deliver and I should monitor their app to keep an eye on future delivery time. Mon 17th June I remained on hold with DPd for 1 hour! to be told, "" we dont know if it will be delivered today, we cant tell any other day it may be delivered or any particular time which may be likely""!!!! Now to be clear DPD phone number begins with an automated message advising if your not happy dont be rude to our staff!!! I wasn't rude to the staff member but it doesn't bode well, when the company your contacting can preempt the customers annoyance at their incompetence!!! I would suggest THEY FIX THEIR PROBLEMS and delete the message.
So I phoned carphone warehouse to be put on hold for another approx 20 mins and then subsequently advised that DPD have lost the phone ( not what their useless app states) So Im out £200.00 with no product!!!! Carphone Warehouse have advised they would look into the matter, and I will update when this has been done, as its an early upgrade I cant change my mind, however the problem is the retailers and they have 30 days from the date of order to deliver the ordered item (by carrier pigeon if they prefer) or full refund. I have used carphone warehouse before, many times without issue, however I will never upgrade with them again and in future will go directly to an 02 store, where I can leave with my item in my hand. This is frustrating and inconvenient, I have to work and I have a life, should I wait about all day everyday with just the hope that an ordered and paid for item might arrive!! I will never buy from any firm that uses DPD. Small courtesy's make all the difference, if DPD had let me know there was a problem or Carphone Warehouse had kept me in the loop it would have went some way to allaying my frustration, several rounds of phonecalls to be placed on hold and waste a morning is not anybody's idea of GOOD SERVICE"

148782,"My son went live on March28th, broadband fine but digital voice still waiting for it to work. Thats 6 weeks without a working phone. BT - wakey wakey. Probably becoming the worse company in the land. Orders to put it right get raised only to be cancelled 24 hours later. You should see the list in the records. What a fiasco. Ive 'reached out' to their CEO for a last resort help.
However, I went live on the same date, unable to keep my number due to old ISP hanging on to it. Notified all my contacts of this new number only to find shortly after my old number arrived unannounced and unexpected, so I had to notify all my contacts again to revert back. as far as my own personal experience is concerned they are usually up there with the best, despite the phone number hiccup. Ive seen the best & probably the worst of BT.
Attn: Mandy - Im not on facebook or twitter so thats killed that idea off. However, all is not lost, Ive made contact with a very nice person resulting from my 'reachout' to their CEO. He has achieved in 6 hours what BT could not manage in 6 weeks. The moral here is if you are getting any hassle from BT, just write a nice letter to their CEO and Im sure things will get sorted out immediately.."

When installing the TV stick on Christmas day it wanted my card details straight away they took a payment of 10 pence.
By the 1st of January they had taken 8.99 I had to cancel my card and contact my bank due to visa only being a available weekdays on speaking with visa they refunded the money back.
I accessed the now TV account it would not let me cancel anything at all and this was a shock.
Today they have taken further money out by obtaining my new card details through my bank as a recurring payment even tho Visa is supposed to of stopped any further payments.
I'm absolutely fumming I have logged a complaint with Resolver on line.
I have to now wait till Monday for Visa to take better action.
Now TVs customer service is disgusting and appalling , patronising no contact number to call only live chat what is an absolutely joke. Sky should be ashamed.

Their customer service is appalling. I ordered on 6th Mar 2020 and have still not received my refund nearly 5 months later. It has always been me initiating the communication to find out what is going on with my refund, they have provided me 4 or 5 different dates that the refund would happen but never managed to deliver on those dates. They told me my refund had happened on 12th June but it has still not yet been received on my credit card. It is now 10 working days after they said they had processed it and they said it may take 7 days working days. Plus they can't provide me any proof that the refund has taken place. Steer clear of this company they are a joke, please don't bother using them if you value your sanity.

I asked to speak to a manager, when on the phone she blatantly kept talking over me. I said to her its a fridge freezer i can't afford to replace the food, I was told there isn't any workers in my area? when i asked why have this insurance for people if you can't provide the service. Her reply was because the repair men in my area are dead from corona ... very condescending attitude passive aggressive.
I said you can not speak to a customer like that she continued saying a repair man will be out on the 19th due to covid everything is delayed etc i said so what am i supposed to do in the meantime regarding the food her reply was unfortunately we don't cover food costs, just being ignorant knowing.
Then she kept on being passive aggressive when i said i'm really not happy with the attitude! if i recorded this and showed currys then she said i have not giving you permission to record me! i said no doubt the call will be recorded anyways then she quickly said i'm hanging up the phone call when i said you can not talk to customers this way.

Was lied to some many times and I have just found out my request to cancel the service has not been done! All this on the same day my service was activated.

Cake box told deliveroo agent that their shop is closed, and the same was told to me by both Deliveroo agent and cake box shop. However Deliveroo is saying that they delivered the cake outside my house. This is amazing as how can they charge me when the shop was itself closed in the first place, and their driver also told me the same thing, when i met him downstairs. Deliveroo is a scam. They treat customers very badly.
Their customer service and agents have the same lines copied in a manual and just copy paste it. Atleast do some research and call the shop and ask them if they made that order. I called the shop twice and they are saying no one from deliveroo customer service contacted them about this order."

181193,"Terrible service.

Bought a Washer/Dryer from Currys and thought I would extend to the installation service as it was over Xmas and we had stacks of washing to do.

The team who came for the installation didn’t communicate very clearly or wait to test the product. On our first test of the product, the kitchen floor flooded as they hadn’t fixed to the waste pipe properly. We tried to correct this error, but still leaking.

Spoke to customer service several times, who are terrible and struggle to communicate clearly. Booked another engineer for the 4th who never turned up, then another for the 5th Jan who also has not turned up now.

Would recommend to avoid installation but also avoid buying anything from Currys – awful customer service so wouldn’t not trust them with another purchase."

Internet down for 5 days.....because a known fault with their V4 hubs can fail after a power cut. Engineer was friendly, customer service couldn't have cared less. Made promises for engineers, that after they didn't arrive, was subsequently told were never booked (clearly lied to just to get an unhappy customer off the phone).

Also since switch to O2 i have NO data or phone signal. The answer....send a new SIM! lol like that is going to work.

Guess what. New SIM didn't even work, wouldn't even connect. The thought of spending another hour trying to get through to somebody who a) cares and b) is competent is too much. PAYG for me now until contract is up and then im outta here.

131544,"Ebuyer have reasonable prices, and an excellent website to order from. They ship items out promptly too.

The reason for the low rating? They use Yodel, and as such the odds of items being delivered on the day Ebuyer say they will be are vastly diminished. My delivery today (a fabled ""next day"" delivery) was not made by Yodel - they never stopped outside my house or even drove onto the road I live on (I have a video doorbell which proves that). According to Yodel delivery was not made because I wasn't home - maybe if they actually came to my house they'd have found I was in. All day. Waiting.

Ebuyer - you are only as good as your delivery courier, so when my items don't arrive because you foolishly use Yodel who do not attempt to deliver on the day promised by both them and you, it is damaging your reputation too since you selected them as your delivery partner."

117568,"I love HMV when orders go smoothly. Then it’s all great - quick dispatch, items packed well, arrive quickly in store or by post.

What I do find frustrating is when you have to chase orders when the items showed as in stock and it turns out they are discontinued, out of stock, or for some other reason dispatch is delayed.

I’ve noticed on some reviews HMV respond by saying they will try to earn those extra stars in future. Wouldn’t it be better just to get in touch when orders can’t be dispatched due to item being discontinued, sold out or delayed for some other reason.

I just ended up shopping elsewhere last time. Items dispatched speedily from my chosen retailer and the items showing as in stock were actually available."

181056,"Vodafone included a £200 charge on account when moving homes due to a change in plan details. Even after speaking to 4 advisors, the billing amount has not been adjusted, only that 'the direct debit will not include the additional charge'. Apparently the fault lies in my hands for moving addresses after the old plan was no longer in use?

Customer service is poor, full security questions had to be completed twice for each contact (1 to a bot, 1 to a human) and I still fear the full amount will be debited on the date or payment, as nothing official is in writing except for a chat transcript.

In response to my dissatisfaction, the advisor added a :). I could be facing financial difficulty due to Vodafone's error and you feel this is appropriate?

Fix your systems!

Update: Hi Vodafone, I will not 'reach out' via social media. I will not waste any more time speaking to an unnamed advisor to receive little to no satisfactory assistance. My final comment is that I will not renew with you once this contract ends."
132400,The part arrived very promptly. It is fitted and the machine working so all is good
129167,I’ve been dealing with Wex for a couple of years and always find them fair on pricing and exceptional on delivery and customer service. Great company.

151566,"Wish I'd come here before going through trade in with this joke of a company. Sent my Galaxy S20 as was offered £210 only to receive an email a week later offering me £40 due to,,,,,,,,,,,,you guessed it, screen burn. Refused the offer and over the last 10 days I've sent them 3 emails asking where my device is and had no response, called customer service this morning and all they can do is escalate it to the trade in team as no way to get in touch the trade in team myself, so I'm now stuck wondering where my device is with nobody available to give me answers!!!!! Will be going through official complaint channels and the ombudsman over this as this definitely seems like outright theft, companies should not be able to treat customers in this way and expect to get away with it no matter what the circumstance!"

They received the phone, evaluated it and money sent to the bank the very same day."

175521,"I have no beef against the general quality of goods MrMemory sell,nor with the efficiency asn speediness of their dispatch, but I have just had a far from good experience with them. I wanted to replace the failing HDD in my PC with an SSD. Their website carefully lead me to specify my PC's model exactly, and offered an SSD alone or a kit including a mounting plate for £12 more. Wanting a hassle free installation I went for the latter. After receiving the kit I found that the mounting plate was not compatible and useless for the job. After several emails they are now proposing I pay a further £23:50 for a unit that will mount the SSD in my PC. I cannot view this as a satisfactory or competent level of service.
(I emailed them a draft of the above to give them a chance tosay I was being inaccurate or not just, I have as yet receved no reply.)
LATER (after reading response below)
Still not satisfied. I find no record of being asked the drive ID before visiting the website, and in any case the website recommended the product I purchased with no inidcation that further information was needed, They have provided a package with an SSD that I presume will be fine, but in a kit that is not fit for purpose. Despite suggestions they have offered no redress but for the offer of return for a refund (presumably at my cost and inconvenience). Therefore this is not a company I can reocmmend or ever will use again."

117307,"On the 23rd of September my cooker hob was accidentally broken and the glass was shattered beyond repair. As I had purchased the Know How plan when I brought the cooker some four years ago I thought I’d contact them to see if they could help.

I called the helpline and I was in a queue for 90 mins. Frustrated I hung up and contacted the team on twitter. I was told to DM them the details, which I did, including photos of the damage. I was given a reference number and then I heard nothing for a week. I tweeted the team again and was asked to explain everything again. I sent them the ref no. and asked them to use that to trace what was going on. I heard nothing for another week. I tweeted again for an update and AGAIN they asked me for the details, despite them all being in the direct message. I explained again and once more, the team vanished without a trace. Upon my fourth try a member of the team finally said I wasn’t covered as I had a care and repair plan (a policy which I believe was introduced in March 2020). I said my plan supersedes that by four years so could they please check my specific plan. I was told no, I’m not covered but I can pay for repairs.

I left it a few weeks as I wasn’t in a position to pay, and lucky that I did, as I was contacted in Oct by a member of the repairs team and was told that my plan did in fact cover the repair and they would like to fix it on the 17th of November, nearly 2 months after my initial query. I took a day off work and waited in all day. The engineer arrives and tells me that the part is out of stock but he took photos and said it would be ordered. I had a call to say they would return on the 23rd with the part. I take another day off and wait at home. At 9am I get a text to say the part has been accidentally smashed and the appointment is cancelled. The last I heard was on the 26th of November to say they were trying to order a replacement. I’ve had no contact since apart from a letter switching me to the inferior care and repair plan that only covers mechanical faults and isn’t the original, and superior, anytime plan.

I’ve tried to call and have been faced with waits of over an hour. I’ve tried Twitter but the team keep asking the same questions over and over again with no resolution. I went to the website to fill in a query form and they are not working (incidentally they have been out of commission since at least sept). It is impossible to contact the repairs people directly as the phone no. which called me is a dead line. Christmas is looming and I have half a cooker to cook with. It’s been four months of having to rely on a microwave and a bottom oven. I’m usually patient with such things, especially with the pandemic, but the total lack of information or a resolution has driven me insane. I’m just waiting for them to go bust and leave everyone waiting for repairs and deliveries completely high and dry. Jokers."
123530,"Lower prices for better specs, what more can you want?

I also engaged with their support team who were very responsive and very helpful"
113079,"Updated review: from 1* to 3*
So currys got back intouch to claim item was out of stock and a replacement was unavailable would i like an alternative product or a refund.
I checked the currys website and the item was infact instock only priced more than double what i ordered it for, Maybe they didnt want to lose out on extra profit however i called to inform them of there mistake and they sent a replacement. To my annoyance the replacement was set to sent to a currys store (wanted home delivery) so a further phone call and it was sorted to be delivered to my address.

The item eventually came, Tatty box, Looked like it may have been opened but the product was fine so ive left it there but yeah will definetly think twice about using in future.

Original review
Order dispatched 29th December 2022. Checked tracking daily until 5th jan. No updates not even been collected by courier.

Got incontact with online chat to be told will take around 7-14 working days to investigate the case.

What a joke.just send a replacement already."
157776,I ordered personalised wedding invitations and was not disappointed. It was easy to create and order. They were delivered promptly and they are quality cards.
183847,"My pc arrived next day
And the pc itself is spot on no complaints here"
159814,"Abysmal so-called ""customer services"".
I called again today about my laptop that's in for repair (10 days so far).

I was passed around to 4 different staff. I asked to speak to a manager and I was told no-one was available, and they'd call me back within seven days.

I also asked to be put through to the complaints department, and she told me that they didn't have one.

The fourth person cut me off. I couldn't be bothered being made to go through all that hassle again so I didn't phone back.

There's a clear language barrier and staff are hard to understand.

Curry's is okay until you start having problems with whatever you bought - then you'll get a lot more problems."
132158,Excellent. From the quote to the payment. Not a problem. Would use them again. Very simple process and quick payment into my bank on the same day they received the phone. Will recommend to friends.

Would recommend to anybody
The customer service is good and very helpful........"

174998,"Been charged for 2 services on an account after it reactivated back in January. Never even used the the account nor do I have any reason to sign up for the services I supposedly did. They told me they can see I’ve never used it but that they’re still keeping the money.

I considered maybe signing up again after legitimately using the service last year. Now they reactivated without my knowledge I will never sign up for now tv again. I feel I’ve effectively had my money stolen"

They were on time, very professional and friendly, I would recommend this service, and really pleased with the overall process from ordering on line, quick delivery to complete installation.
Thank you"
142768,Simply hopeless agents/service. In the process of merging with another clown company aka EE. Imagine the mayhem. My recommendation is to give them both a wiiiiiiide berth.
149140,"TL;DR: pay a bit more and go somewhere else if you want real customer services and after sales.

We were moving home so we decided to buy new appliances and decided for Currys because we trusted their services even though they were not the cheapest. How wrong we were...

I ordered online through their website and then talked on the chat about delivery. They reassured me they would deliver to the first floor without lift to my flat door. A week after the order Currys called me trying to sell the extra warranty. I asked again about delivery after I said I did not want this extra warranty, and again they reassured me they will certainly deliver.

Delivery day. Disappointment day. Delivery guys said they will not lift the washer dryer because they have 30 more deliveries and they wouldn't be able to do them if they lifted every one of them (bad luck being one of the first ones). They also told me to call customer services and request a delivery refund.

I spent 3 hours that day on the phone with Currys. 3 different agents pass me from one to another without issuing any refund. I hung up.

I tried one week later and they hung up on me twice.

I tried again a few days later and one agent started to issue the refund for the delivery but the call got ""cut"". I called again and another agent denied the delivery involved lifting appliances to your flat. I requested to speak to a manager. They said they were booking a manager call next day between 4 and 6pm. It is 1 week already and I am still waiting for that manager to call me.

I would avoid Currys if I was you. Try luck with the other appliances providers."
139567,Salisbury store checked out my HP 250 PC and said the PC was good but they wouldn't take it because the power supply was not correct. The power supply was a genuine HP one for the PC supplied direct. I asked my computer guy to check that the power supply was correct - he confirms it is absolutely the right one. The guys in the store don't seem to understand basic electronics

161009,"What a terrible company and extremely unhelpful. I visited a store several times and I was assured on each occasion that the phone I was interested in had a dual sim. After purchasing I identified that it wasn’t - a feature most important to me .

Trying to get a helpful response return and refund is proving impossible.

I am pleased to report that my issue has been satisfactorily resolved, took a while to get the problem understood - now a three star rating"
108610,"I received a call today from Shell Energy. Natasha H was very polite and a good ambassador for Shell Energy.

What I do not understand is why Shell Energy when calling me, a customer, demands that I give them all my personal details: Full name, mobile number, full address and email address. Has Shell Energy not heard of spoofing? Is Shell Energy not aware of spam attacks? Is Shell Energy not aware of hacking? Is Shell Energy not aware of all the consumer programmes and government advice not to give personal information to a caller? There are bad people out there. By persisting with this old-fashioned approach, Shell Energy does not give reassurance to its customers.

Natasha H was very understanding when I raised my concerns with her about this. I have no complaints about her handling of the call. She said she would relay my concerns back to whoever makes decisions in Shell Energy."

177968,Offered a whopping £200 for my iPhone 13 Pro 512GB for the ‘scratches and black spots on camera? Load of rubbish. Always been in a case + screen protector. Has now been upped to an offer of £350 still not good enough. Absolute scam. They are making up fake damage.

118614,"Of all the stream apps I've used (Netflix, Amazon, Disney+, etc.), NOW TV has BY FAR the worst UI and UX. Awful bugs. Had to stop watching the Sopranos because a couple of episodes would stop playing mid way through. Logged a support ticket and no resolution months later. Also charged me for 3 different memberships when I was only signed up for one. Customer support are unhelpful and openly antagonistic. Cannot adequately express how frustrating my experience with NOW TV has been. A blight on society."
192217,"First time purchase, yet easy to find appliance and order. Delivery next working day with notification of delivery. Delivery persons were excellent, friendly and efficient in unpacking item, made sure was working and taking away old appliance. Although paid extra for above was worth it in my opinion.

I received a text a few minutes later to say my return has been accepted. I contacted the customer service immediately and was told the driver went to an address (wrong address I assume), and the person there rejected the delivery as they didn’t order it, so Argos have put it through as a return. I tried to explain that the delivery was not made to my address, I did not reject it, and I’d like the driver to deliver it to me (this was within an hour of the delivery being ‘rejected’) and I was told there was nothing they can do, the return had already been processed. They never rang my bell, knocked, or called my phone. They made no attempt to deliver the package and the customer service rep said there is nothing they can do. I’ll be short a few Christmas presents now! It doesn’t seem to make any sense, it must cost them more to process the return and refund me rather than just giving me the items I bought."
131536,"Bought a refurbed Macbook Pro in Nov 21 which developed a screen fault just under a year later in Nov 22. Raised a ticket and MM honoured the warranty. I couldn't return it until 2 months later, which I did using their free returns. 48 hours later they refunded the machine. Outstanding service. I bought another from them the same day. I am always slightly worried there is no customer services phone number or chat function, but their email team are SUPER responsive. Highly recommend."

130636,"Offered me £225 for my Samsung galaxy fe 21. It had only been used 4 months and had always had a case and screen protector on. There were no scratches on the phone at all.
So imagine my surprise when 3 days after receiving my phone (advertised as same day service - that didn't happen) I received an email stating that due to more than 3 scratches they are lowering the price they would offer me.
As I have already spent £8 sending the phone to them by special delivery I felt I had to take the lower amount.
I have another 2 phones to send but most certainly not be using this company again!"
130404,Had to order this as original catch broke and box distorted so filters did not fit snuggly. Original catch is a grossly inadequate design relying on thin ABS plastic for tension which is guaranteed to fail. I see in new one they have tried to strengthen it. Should have offered replacement at a concessional price and been honest about it Mr Grey.

183108,"Despite the negative press the company has (perhaps deservedly) received, I can only write from my own experiences which have been surprisingly positive. After an Openreach line fault and years of a substandard ADSL2+ connection, I looked at the old Telewest faceplate in the living room and, thanks to the option of a 1-month rolling contract, decided to give Virgin Media a try.

The QuickStart package was delivered on time and after getting connected, the line was active with minimal fuss. I started out on M300 and the bandwidth was as promised, which was - at the time - a revelatory experience, as my previous connection was just 10Mbit down/1Mbit up via ADSL2+. Surprisingly, latencies were also good; despite the inherent jitter of DOCSIS technologies, my average ping had even reduced by a few ms. Note however that I put the Hub 3 into modem mode and used my own router: an ASUS RT-AX82U. I cannot in good conscience recommend any VM customer to use the Hub itself as the router.

Unlike friends I had known to use Virgin services, there was no peak time congestion, no packet loss or skyrocketing pings. Just a steady, consistent service. I suppose I won the postcode lottery? The experience convinced me to sign up for an 18-month M500 contract, and the bandwidth increase was carried out as promised without issue. I have been with them for nearly 2 years and can count the number of times I needed support on one hand - in these instances, the forums were more useful than strictly via phone.

I have to dock a star for a couple of reasons - there was a period of several months where the connection would be down for hours at a time, or drop out and reconnect at an awkward moment. However it has now been stable for a few months with no sign of further issues. Also, in order to get the best contract deals, which seem to be largely arbitrary and not published on the website, you have to threaten to cancel and go through the retentions team.

When my contract period expires I will be moving to another company, because multiple FTTP altnets are overbuilding in the area and the technology is simply superior (until VM themselves eventually finish their XGS-PON upgrades). However if this isn't an option in your area, you can do worse than taking a chance on VM. Just take up a one month contract, and see how they do for a few months before negotiating any longer-term commitments."

175204,"I am with Vodafone broadband for over a year now. I have started my contract in February, they have increased the contract value from £21 to £23 just after 1.5 months of joining with them. Now they have another price increase of 8.2%, which will bring the bill to over £25 PCM. this is over £4 per month which was initially agreed. i find that the problem is not with the internet but their customer service. They also do not have 1-year contracts for Broadband so I switch to it. The only way is to wait till the contract is finished. I feel scammed by them as the same plan as i have is offered for £19 PCM. I doubt that I will be returning to Vodafone for broadband or want any services from them. NOw companies provide FIXED plans. If you are reading this, please do not make the same mistake as I did by joining them. Called them to discuss the plan change so the cost can be pushed back, they asked if i want to upgrade for another 2-year contract... so technically it's a long-run endless story."

145268,Apoaulling customer service. Kept on hold for two hours They promised to phone me back to let me know when my microwave will be delivered never heard a thing back l was promised emails that didn’t arrive either . Total waste of time . Worst customer service ever Experienced still waiting for my microwave. Delivery was promised three weeks ago x do not buy anything from this company today l have been in the store . My microwave is there with my name on it . But they won’t let me take the microwave or give me a refund because their system has got no record of it being delivered there so they refused to release it . The manager was extremely condescending and spoke like she was reading off an idiot board . Showed no emotion or sympathy for what had happened and let felt very belittled . However the young lad that first served us was more understanding . So now they have taken my money and my microwave !!! Totally unacceptable .
175233,Timely delivery and customer service which excelled. The gentleman at the Crow Road store went out of his way to be helpful in returning an item which had compatibility problems ... and we had such a laugh!
182129,"I have purchased an internet dongle from them, and soon came to realize that their coverage in my area is rubbish. Although their "" systems"" say there is 4G available in the area where I live, I was not even getting 1MB speed for upload or download. Long story short. A couple of days into this I have decided to cancel the contract within the 14 days cooling off period, and so the problems began.
Their - ABROAD - customer service advisors basically were bullying me into keeping the contract and were not listening to what I was saying. I am not an IT savant but I know enough to make an informed decision, plus it was my right as a consumer to change my mind if I was not happy with the service within those 14 days.
They have never advised over the phone that I need to wait and receive a special bag from them to send the device back in, and on their website under returns terms and conditions, there is no such instructions either. All that the customer advisors were doing, was trying to stall for time for those 14 days to expire.
I have decided to act according to the instructions on the terms and conditions on their website and return the dongle and accessories. Said and done. I have sent it via recorded signed for - THANK GOD - to their returns address along side the form.
It took them a whole month to "" find"" the device, as although it was signed for at the delivery address, they could not find it, then it got lost, then it never arrived. All different stories.
Meanwhile I was getting letters and emails that my bill is overdue - so paying for something that I have never used, or used for 2 days, and poorly because of their poor signal, usage was impossible.
It has now been several months of going backwards and forwards with their customer service team, all based abroad, no chance to even speak to someone in the UK; where they have failed over and over again to cancel this contract. Meanwhile my credit score is being affected thanks to them, because I appear like I have not paid my bill, and their throwing in their emails and letters stuff like we will send bailiffs if this remains unpaid.
I have had countless telephone calls that I have made to their customer support, and I have been assured that I DO NOT have to pay anything and that this will cancelled, that there is no way that I will be stuck in a 2 years contract.
Yet, they keep on failing to sort this issue out and give me stress, because of their slow and inefficient ways of working.
I would not recommend this company even to my worse enemy. Giving them a one star review is me being indulgent for the few members of staff that have worked hard to locate the device that "" got lost"" /"" never arrived""."
145343,"Arrived quick ,good condition ,works fine, very pleased would recommend thankyou"

121998,"I have placed an initial order with a standard delivery time for a birthday gift. When I received the confirmation email it stipulate a later date. I cancelled the order and re-order with fast delivery which also gave a later delivery date on the confirmation email.

163214,Three signal is awfull. I have been using it for more than one year just because calcellation is impossible!!! There is usually a lack of network all around London particularly in central London. The data is also terrible! I always use wifi either at home or work because Three data is useless! Never have data!!! They don't let you cancell your contract and you have to pay a lot of money for no service!

127312,"I just got an email showing that I had APPARENTLY bought a boost and cinema 7 day free trial. I had NOT. I've had the entertainment pass and I did not apply this. I can see now why people are angry, because if I had not read this email I could have been charged more.

If these are the tactics that NOW TV are using then that makes them 100% untrustworthy in my book. I have no desire at all for boost or the cinema package. Why would I buy something I don't want or need. They have done this I'm sure of it. Sky you got greedy and I will not be supporting your greed anymore."
102459,"Very are fine, but Collect+ are useless. Trying to return a parcel, but no one has collected for 2 weeks at the two branches nearest to me. And with the Royal Mail strikes, who knows how long they’ll take. I’d switch to Evri."
114742,"If I could give a score of 0 that would be probably the most accurate rating.

We purchased a TV that had faults from the start. When the TV was 6 months old Curry’s took in back for repair and wrote it off. They then told us that the TV had depreciated in value and as we had owned it for 6 months they knocked £130 off the price we paid for it and would only issue a store voucher for the lesser amount!
It is daylight ROBBERY and I will NEVER set foot in a Curry’s store ever again.

If you buy a product from curry’s and it goes wrong - may God help you. You’ll have more luck I am certain.
TEAM ‘DON’T KNOW HOW’ ARE USELESS.

If you actually manage to speak to one of the ‘Customer service representatives’ after the tedious automated system, they won’t have the faintest clue on how to deal with your issue. You’ll have to explain your problem to someone who couldn’t sound less interested if they tried. They’ll then put you on hold before telling you they can’t see your details and you need to go through to a different department. At this point, 8 times out of 10 you will get cut off.
If it’s your lucky day and someone else answers then you’ll have to start the whole story again. On average I would guess you’ll go through to about 6 or 7 different departments repeating yourself. They’ll all tell you that they’ll email their manager and will sincerely promise to call you back within 72 hours, you’ll actually believe this as they sound so genuine, rest assured, they will NEVER CALL YOU BACK.
If you suggest that you would like to email the manager directly to try and sort the problem out without the middle man, they’ll tell you the managers don’t have email addresses. Bless them, they don’t seem to grasp how email addresses work. Also at this point they’ll usually cut you off, I can only assume as their stupidness has reached it’s limit and they’re not quite sure what to do next.

It’s customer service at its absolute worst. The people on the end of the phones are so stupid it’s like speaking to the most incompetent people in the world. How they are even employed I have no idea. Apparently you need GCSEs for Maccies these days, maybe this is where they all go when that doesn’t work out.

Good luck with these bunch of wasters.

I have never, and I mean never, dealt with a worse company.

Trading Standards have been contacted."
152207,"Booked and paid for a delivery slot for yesterday, disconnected our old cooker and dragged it outside in preparation and then waited............and waited and waited.
The new cooker did not arrive.
We rang customer services and was told it had been delayed and the driver was on drop 13 and we were drop 16.
The delivery driver did not bother to contact us to say it wouldn't be coming and did not turn up.
We rang again this morning, complained and asked when my cooker was going to arrive and have now been told it can't be delivered until tomorrow!
Apparently it's acceptable to not show up and deliver a item when it's supposed to be delivered, to leave a family unable to cook their children dinner for 2 days and to offer a measly £20 Good will gesture!!!
Will not use this company again, very very unhappy with the over all service."
197075,"I’ve written a review before in December and this is a follow up.

Real shame I can’t give this company a minus start review.

Having raised a complaint when they repeatedly lied about the activation date I also withdrew from the contract (I’m so glad I did as I would’ve gotten involved in a months long nightmare of I stayed with them)
Having withdrawn from the contract in December 2021 they decided to close my complaint too without even looking at or addressing it. Pretty sure that’s a fail as far as the FOS is concerned.
They also said I’d be getting my £50 odd refund back but here we are, nearly 2 months later into February and still no sign of a refund, despite having returned their useless kits with tue bags provided.
I’m really hoping to avoid having to call them again because it’s almost impossible to get through to someone and even if you do, you just get lied to and given false promises time and again and I really don’t want to waste anymore of my time with BT.

Im currently seeking legal advice for:
1) falsely closing down a customer complaint/not acknowledging it
2) theft of the £50 odd deposit fee, which they said they would refund but still haven’t.



Honestly Im so glad at this age and in my wisdom I smelt the completely sub standard customer services BT provide and withdrew from being in a contract with them.
Honestly; Sky had me up and running in under 2 weeks and over the Xmas period might I add and on the agreed activation date."

188382,"On the 27th Dec I ordered an element for my oven which broke down Christmas Day. I paid £6.99 for next day delivery. It was delivered to the wrong house, I was told to go look for it basically which I did but no sign of any parcel. I have contacted Espares twice via their contact form but nothing back so far. I have also contacted dpd but zero help from them.
I understand dpd delivery service isn’t e spares fault but they’ve not given me the requested refund which I need to be able to go buy an element from someone else! It’s been one week today since my order and even taking into account the Xmas period I would have expected something back. My Xmas and new years family celebrations were not what they should have been. I will never buy from Espares again or any other company that uses dpd as their courier service!
Update on this review. After complaining again to espares through their online message service, I received a phone call with an apology for what happened. The item was returned to them so they issued me a full refund."
198197,I got my phone from car phone warehouse last month on contract. The staff were really helpful and informative. I wasn't looking for a new phone but with the deals that were in-store I couldn't resist. Thank you car phone warehouse for helping me choose my phone. The staff there also helped me to get my phone up and running! Thank you once again x

121076,"On August 26th I phoned BT to cancel my second BT box a simple thing to do you would think. Within a second of putting the phone down I get an email to say thank you for renewing your broadband with BT. I phoned BT back and asked what this was all about I canceled my BT second box and never even discussed broadband. I was told this was a system error and no one could work out why this has happened DON'T WORRY YOUR CONTRACT IS THE SAME AS BEFORE NOTHING WILL CHANGE. Want a bet a few days ago I checked my account and my contract had been extended to a new date in September 2023 unbelievable without any permission given by myself. I have an ongoing complaint with BT on this matter It's not difficult to work out why there are so many bad reviews about this company. My contract ends on May 31st, 2023 and my direct debit will be canceled on that date and then we will let Ofcom sort it out."

178651,"I felt very happy to explain, my issues, to the person I spoke to. He was kind and understanding. I didn’t feel intimidated in any way. Came off the phone very happy to have the issues solved. I no longer feel stressed . A big thank you 👍!"
154851,By far the worst company I have delt with and that’s both residential and business. Imagine demanding over £60 because of YOUR mess up and then adding late charges ONTOP.
199596,"Really where to start. This has been a litany of failure on BTs part from start to finish. I built a new house 20 ms from a fibre pole that serves three other buildings. I made an application to Openreach for a new connection but I was told I didn’t need to have one and I should just phone my provider. I did this and I was told I needed first to get a copper line - I said the fibre pole was in front of me but apparently I had to get something I didn’t need first. I agreed but when the copper engineers turned up twice they realised it was a fibre job and left. I was sent a BT router. I made my first complaint and was told now I could get fibre and so I needed to cancel the first order and place a fibre order. This then closed my first complaint. I placed the order only to be told the next morning that this was wrong and I needed a copper engineer. One duly turned up and again left for the same reason as before. I was sent another BT router. I then phoned up after being caught in the Kafkaesque world. I didn’t exist on the map but I couldn’t get copper or fibre to put me on the map. I spoke then directly to Openreach who put me on the map. Then I placed my third BT order (we are now three months into the saga) I was promised that I would have an install for the 4th of April and then this became the 17th. I complained again when I was now told this was the 12th of May. I was told my complaint would be taken by the person I was complaining about and that she wouldn’t phone me until early May. She then told me a CPD had to be built - I phone Openreach and they said this wasn’t true fibre was there and available. In the meantime I made sure I was signed up to BT Hybrid connect so at least I could get a 4G router. I was sent this but when it didn’t work I was told it was not associated with my account. So then they send me mini hub but they had taken down the wrong address so it got lost so I had to order another one. This all started in February - I am still looking wistfully at the pole with the fibre on. This is just one of many sagas with BT - take for example the 20 engineers who came over a period of a month to try to fix a broken fibre cable - all of whom were not qualified to do so. This has to be the most dysfunctional company I have every dealt with. It’s truly amazing how awful their organisation is and how many millions of pounds they must be wasting every year.

So Neil pretty standard reply who is actually going to help me?"
115462,"Awful customer service. I got somebody else's order instead of mine, and the customer service people couldn't have been less helpful. I get that they are probably not paid much. But I have no food and no refund for ten days, so I can't even replace the order. Really abrupt employees and just all a bit rubbish. I wonder if UberEats is still a thing."
136097,"The goods were great, ordeing online easy, served fast.
I would have given 5 stars but I have been inundated with pestering emails ever since! Unsubscribing after two annoying weeks having not ever subscribed in the first place. Taking liberty's with my data because I ordered online!"
121980,"My tv broke just before Christmas, I never got to see the football or hardly any Christmas movies, I have a 9 year old daughter who had nothing to watch, the service I received was so poor , no updates or communication or feed back, just totally unacceptable"
122721,"Still god-awful signal from these lying bags of pig droppings. Any song you want to hear? Best prepare for only 10 to 30 secs of your song before an endless amount of buffering and the song never playing until you get to around 4 feet from your front door and your wifi (not provided by Vodafone) takes over. Lo and behold everything works. Why? Because Vodafone's so called best signal network is one giant lie. At best all my phone gets is around the old max signal for the 3g network signal. Unfortunately, nowadays this won’t even let you unlock your phone. Great job Vodafone but hey at least you win the WORST mobile signal providers title yet again. That’s what at least 2 years I’ve been counting? If I really thought about it I think they would be the all time champions for poor signals and lies."
128468,"The problem starts from the very first day, a Virgin engineer came to connect everything, she left all the cables on the floor, she said that everything was disorganized in the box and that she had to come back another day, she left and left us with a minimum coverage of Internet. Two weeks later the internet connection is intermittent, it goes every ten minutes. We have written to Virgin and they do not give us any solution. This useless company is not recommended at all."
172374,Good to find parts that fit although very expensive.
158835,"very bad poor and horrible customer services, i just had a call from the team who clearly says he cannot write off my laptop and there has been several issues in the past with my laptop and they disagree to replace it.
the claims pcworld/currys make they will replace any object if it is not working properly or damaged is FALSE. they never replace. i would never buy any products or recommend other to buy products from this retailer, absolutely frustrating, and disgusting..
i must have sent my laptop to your centre atleast 30 times and been paying 5£ every month for last couple of years it is disgusting i get treated this badly when i request to write off absolutely filthy and disgusting customer services and false claims on their website. never buy anything from you guys again.. filthy scum baags at it best."

First class customer service and brilliant pre-purchase advise. Very quick delivery too."
157593,"Having used Mazuma many times before and been impressed with their service, this will be the last time. I sent my phone in after being told it was worth £300. Upon receipt they changed their offer because of excessive scratches on the device. I disputed this but they were adamant that the phone was not in the ""Excellent condition"" I had claimed. They sent me blurred and out of focus photos to try and back their claim. The one photo that was in focus showed a few scratches on the edge of the device around the charging connector on an 18 month old phone, no more than approximately 2mm in length. Unless you are sending them a ""brand new unopened"" phone, I would not expect it to be classed as ""excellent"". I will not be using this company ever again, and I cannot recommend them to anyone else."
166863,"There are items that need addressing these being -
- My boiler is different to that shown on the paperwork. It could be an issue if I had required spare parts.
- After the service engineers visit I received emails to say that my boiler had been repaired and was up and running again. I had only had it serviced it had not broken down. Not really sure why it was sent.
- I am still waiting for the service engineers report as proof that the boiler has been serviced should I need it.

The overall service was good, my boiler was serviced as scheduled by a competent service engineer the system requires sharpening up."

171475,"Where do I begin with this vile company! I was with Vodafone for 12 years dutifully paying my phone bills and nearly left a few times but got talked into staying...then got talked into buying a google pixel phone and extortionate contract off them 2 years ago, the worst phone I've ever had in my life and an extremely expensive contract that I could of got cheaper elsewhere. I ended up buying a new phone early on as the pixel was just useless...I rang Vodafone a few times to sort issues out with the phone but hey when your stuck in an expensive contract they don't give a damn and are just downright unhelpful. When my contract was up I rang to leave this vile company and yes as usual took ages to answer, ages to sort leaving, I asked that there were no outstanding charges and told there wasn't. Just got a letter from debt collection agency saying I owe this disgusting company £20.72 + charges! They hadn't even sent me a letter previously about this...Vodafone are categorically the most shambolic, rude rip off company going. There really should be a zero star option as one star is way too high for this thieving company who I would not recommend in any way at all.To add insult they have put in red letters at the top of the debt collectors demand letter my account has now been closed..I LEFT VODAFONE BECAUSE THEIR A REVOLTING, RUDE, CORRUPT PHONE COMPANY!!!! Cheers Vodafone I was a loyal never missed a payment customer i can see from all the bad reviews that you really need to take a good look at how you treat ALL your customers as we pay for your wages and profits...."

122124,"I had the worst experience ever with the product purchased.

1) package was delayed by 2 weeks - setup
2) package setup was incorrect - I was paying for live TV channels but hasn’t received the correct TV box
3) TV box didn’t work, tried to explain that it was broken and not working - I was transferred to 5 different departments and on hold for hours
4) after deciding id had enough and wanted to cancel - this in turn took x3 attempts to complete successfully as employees kept hanging up on me and not fully completing the cancellation
5) tried charging me the cancellation fee even though I was still in the cooling off period.

I’m still technically in the process of cancelling and awaiting the next steps for collection of equipment etc. really worried over how long this final part is going to take as I’ve just had enough of spending my evenings on the phone to them trying to explain my situation. No one ever seems to understand or care which causes a detrimental impact on their product and service provided.

Overall - SO glad I’m leaving. I hope there is an intervention at some point to help ensure customer service is resolved as it’s worrying how they let their staff get away with the appalling level of service."
196506,"Having tried to sell an iPhone to another company and having been scammed by them offering a good price then trying to substantially reduce this on receipt of phone by claiming it had non existent scratches and markings, (the phone was in pristine condition as confirmed when I received it back from them having refused to sell at their revised price), I thought I'd try to sell it to CeX as an apparently 'reputable' company. Lo and behold had exactly the same experience. This time I was a little more savvy. I asked for photographic evidence of the markings/scratches on my iPhone. What happened next would be laughable if it was not serious. They sent me photos of an iPhone with lots of bad marks on the bottom, and substantial scratches on the rear of it - clearly not my iPhone as my photos of my iPhone confirmed. Miraculously they then said they had ""reviewed"" the matter and would offer me the original price! Another company in this market seemingly operating highly dubious practices or with shambolic processes that result in ownership of devices sent to them being muddled up. My advice - always take photos of your device before sending to these sorts of buyers and if they then claim non existent markings etc, provide them with photo evidence and threaten legal action if necessary."
109279,"Called customer services to cancel my broadband due to poor speeds, had to wait on hold for an eternity in order to speak to someone. Finally spoke to someone, I gave them my details and then they put me on hold again for a long time! They then finally spoke to me again, only to tell me that apparently their systems were down and that my broadband could not be cancelled but rest assured someone will call me back later today in order to complete the cancellation. 6 hours later, no call back received, tried calling customer services again but decided to put the phone down after waiting on hold for an hour! Vodafone should be utterly ashamed of their disgraceful customer service and I would strongly advise against anyone joining Vodafone!"
198856,Ordered home Broadband early November. Original install date 30th December; delayed to 24th January. Now delayed again until ??? Have called Virgin Media repeatedly to explain location of my house and requirements for cable installation. Usually have to wait 30 to 40 mins+ to speak with some unintelligible person in Philippines. I have spent hours on the phone waiting / re-explaining situation. They clearly do not understand requirements and appear unable/unwilling to connect me with someone in their installations team / the UK. Not sure when / if I will get service.....or whether I want it with this unbelievably bad customer service.

156165,"Please avoid using Carphone warehouse. They are taking payment for products on their website that are out of stock with no planned date of when they will be in stock. They should notify you of this before you complete the transaction not after you have paid.

Worse still when I have made contact to try and find out when my non existent phone will arrive they are unable to give me an update as they don't know. Sorry, but I just don't believe that. I work in retail distribution & manage multiple warehouses & our systems tell us exactly when all new orders of bulk stock will arrive in our warehouse so if they have placed an order for stock it will have a planned delivery date. When challenged on this their customer services then said it takes 72 hrs to find out when stock will arrive & that I will have to keep contacting them for updates. Surely as the customer paying they should be pro active & contacting me to update, not the other way around.

Please save your money & order from a professional company who only take payment for live stock & have a professional customer service team. I only wish I could score them zero stars but I can't go below 1."

172520,"Only because you don’t do zero stars !

Hurrah it feels like my birthday ! 18 months of being stuck in a contract with these lying rats, but first thing this morning I gave these wasters the 30 day’s notice they required, what a great way to start the day.

I’ll give you a warning folks, have absolutely nothing to do with their lying door knocking sales people. This particular fella told us a pack of lies, they (VM) supported him.

At the outset we were sent a self set up kit, unfortunately they sent the wrong stuff and we couldn’t be set up. It then took a week before one of their engineers could come out and resolve the problem. Consequently we had no service for a week, but believe it or not they charged us for it, no refund, no compensation.

We were previously with Sky and we required a hub plus an additional router, they lying salesman said no problem we’ll make sure you get it. The engineer, he also confirmed that we’d need the extra router, 18 months later we are still waiting for it, what a way to treat customers eh.
During the 18 month period we’ve had useless reception/signal to the rear of the house, we have approached them several times, no luck but they did try to sell us one, it really beggars belief.

But to day is a lovely day, we’ve cancelled our home service and as the contracts have come to an end we’ve cancelled our business service’s, our business phones (6) and our three children’s services, all of which we pay for.

I run three large businesses, each one deals with the general public on a day to day basis, if I had given our customers the customer service you’ve given us I’m pretty sure we’d have none.

We put many reviews on here, mostly they are positive reviews, I’m a fan of Trust pilot, I have never had to put this type of review on here before, take heed folks.

2) You have to go on the website to chose what to watch, which then opens the player (or not if its being buggy)

3) It doesn't play on, so if I'm watching a series I have to actively click the 'play next episode' box in the corner. If I miss this box the player reverts to the start screen and the log-in and website thing has to be done again.

4) There's no 'Skip intro' and there's no thumbnail box when dragging along the timeline so you can see where you are.

5) You have to pay to subscribe to all the different variations. And its expensive for the quality of the software.

After a number of promises to refund, I was of the opinion I would have to take to small claims court, I contacted my bank, who started to look at the transaction, dont know if this was of any significance but 2 days later, the full amount from Quick Fix mobiles was credited to my account, with no correspondence from them. So if like me you are still waiting for their refund try contacting your bank - this may be a coincidence but thankfully I went to another company ran by one of the phone networks that you get sim cards for, it was recommended because of their tariffs, I read their reviews. Within 24 hours a fabulous refurbished phone arrived and have had no problems with it. If you do trade with Quick fix be warned as a lot of the reviews I have seen were having same problems as me, to be fair this happened through lockdown so they may have been having some financial or supply issues, but that is as fair as I will be."
113248,"Terrible experience
My advice would be to choose a different broadband provider. My experience has been awful, 16 days after my contract started my broadband failed and it took three months before they fixed it. During this time they continued to take my money for a service they could not provide.
Once my contract ends, I will NOT be renewing."
107034,"My wife and I have been away and on our return we decided to buy an LG Oled TV. However, when contacting the Cardiff store the VIP offer of £849 had expired. We wanted this TV and when contacting the store were told that the VIP offer was not available and we had to accept a £20 reduction against this TV on a “price promise.” ( A cost of £929). A couple of days later we then receive emails from R.S. offering the same TV for £899, VIP price on an open box deal ! This really rubbed salt in the wound …..
To cap it all we arranged for a free home delivery, 3-5 working days. The order was placed on the 6/1/22 and we have been told it’s being delivered tomorrow, 10 days after the order. 3-5 working days should have been Friday 13th at the latest….
Why weren’t we told that this TV was being discounted 2 days after buying it ?
I would like to add that following my initial review, Richer Sounds Customer Services contacted me and refunded the difference between what I paid and the discounted price that became available 2 days later. I have therefore improved my rating to 5 stars…. This gesture was not expected but greatly appreciated, I would recommend and use R.R. in the future."
121550,"I have nothing good to say about this company.

(Also note - they have created multiple trust pilot pages, all of which apart from this one, have a 1 star rating - it makes sense they would want to cover their tracks, given their track record of dissatisfied and outraged customers. it really goes to show how trustworthy of a business this is.)

I placed an order on the 27th April, and recieved an empty cardboard box. QMF failed to offer any explanation how this happened. I am now (still, over two months later) out £415 and they are refusing to refund me until they are done ""investigating"" which was meant to take a maximum of 8 days to conclude.

Furthermore, their customer service is shocking. All their emails are clearly scripted and their responses often ignore half of what you ask in your email. They are of absolutely no help when they DO reply, so it's just as well that they have been ignoring my emails and social media DMs for the better part of three weeks now. Very professional.

Save your money, your time, your stress levels, and go somewhere else for a refurbished phone. The few extra pounds it may cost you will be well worth it.

Just know that if (when) this trust pilot page is replaced once again with a clean slate, my review will be following."
156779,"Not content with dropping speeds down to dial up level, three now can't even maintain a connection long enough to do internet banking.
What happened? Three used to be the best but over the last 5 years have turned to absolute garbage. If you're willing to waste an hour, try contacting their useless customer service who can basically verbalize their script, which tries to blame you, your device and then your SIM card. The reality is that their network is trash. They'll try and tell you 'it will be fixed soon' to get you off their case and nothing improves.

Response to Three's reply;
Updating? You've been saying thar for years and the whole time the network has become worse!"
127849,"So bad things do come in threes. Firstly very rude and aggressive tv wall installation service who did not install to specification and left a loose bracket. I complained and arranged for a correction the following week. Nobody showed up and I did not get a call but the job was declared complete on the track it website. I missed my sons football match to ensure I was home. I complained again and they arranged a third visit the following weekend. Again I missed my sons football match. This time I got a call 50 mins before the end of the 4 hour slot telling me they would not come as the driver had reached his time limit. Absolutely fuming !!! Will go into Currys PC world tomorrow to ask for a refund so I can get a professional outfit to install my TV.

Thanks for the response Ryan. You (not you personally but your company) had 3 opportunities to resolve this and failed on all 3 occasions. I have now received my refund. It is a shame your excellent staff at cribs causeway Bristol are being let down by your subcontractors who do not know what customer service is."

They are denying that any money has been taken, it is showing as pending on my bank statement but bank have confirmed the money has been taken.

Online chat gets cut off every time I show more proof that they are lying and have to go back to the beginning. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!"

151854,DO NO USE THIS COMPANY!! I have used them for years and have had multiple phone so I purchased a phone thinking it would be an amazing service like before. However I was very wrong!! I bought a phone on January 9th 2021 and was told I would receive it in 7-10 days but allow some time for covid restrictions. It has been 39 days!! I have sent numerous emails and they are just replying with excuses. I sent an email demanding information and they replied saying they understand that I wish to cancel my order. I didn’t even cancel my order! I am now waiting on my refund however I am not holding out any hopes that I will receive it within 14 days

123668,"A couple of weeks ago, I couldn't access my email. I called their helpline and had great difficulty understandin the gentlman that was supposed to be helping me. Howener he eventually told me that I needed to reset my password. As I have two PC's at home plus my mobiles I had to do this to all of them. Some of it worked but not Talk Talk mail. The next time I called I was told that the previous time, the problem was at their end. So I had wasted hours of mt time changing my password on all my machines only to find that the fault was with them.
I sad that I wished to raise a complaint as they had wasted hours of my time. This has been another waste of my time as they are virtually impossible to communicate with. Awful company. Avoid like the plague."

I made my complaint formally to them, where Rob Simmons professionally and quickly investigated my accusations. He assured me that Carphone Warehouse and it's affiliates had not contacted me, and that my number was now added to a ""do not call"" list internally.
He explained that the calls I was receiving were most likely a scam from someone who wanted to pretend to be the Carphone Warehouse.
Thank you for clearing this up in a speedy and professional manner."

171197,Awful! They did the same thing to me as countless others on here. My phone may not have been in “excellent” condition but it absolutely more than fit their “good” criteria and they took the offer from £210 to £70! When I contested this they did raise it but I said I wouldn’t accept less than their “good” offer. Please use alternative companies. These guys don’t ever pay out the advertised cost and you will be disappointed!

Absolutely delighted. Totally recommend pc specialist for both their equipment and their service.

135219,"If I could give them no stars I would! I had copper broadband & phone with them for 3 years. But spent nearly 4 months with no connection at all this summer due to their refusal to reconnect me!

I’d always paid my bills in full and on time and in April this year I renewed my contract with them. But they apparently made an ‘error’ their end and I was disconnected by openreach! They then spent 3 and a half months telling me I couldn’t have my copper line reconnected and that I had to have fibre due to ‘business reasons’! - part of their big push to get everyone on fibre. I work from home full time but couldn’t for almost 4 months because I had no working landline & no broadband! I waited and waited for copper reconnection or fibre … and absolutely nothing happened, nothing was installed!

In the end after they cancelled one connection date in Sept apparently because of another problem their end, and then rescheduled it for the bank holiday of the queens funeral!! Which obviously was never going to happen, I told them I was going elsewhere. 2 weeks later Sky had me reconnected! So quick! No problems at all! I do wish I’d changed provider much sooner!
Vodafone’s customer service is absolutely the worst I have ever experienced. I really am not joking! If you have to deal with them get everything in writing. Don’t deal with them by phone. On the phone they just tell you one lie after another and the next agent you speak to readily admits the person before them lied to you. Lying to customers and then just admitting it, before telling more lies, just seems to be systemic in the culture of this company’s customer service policies! They really don’t care…because they know their so big. Losing one customer really doesn’t matter to them.

I really hope others don’t have the same dreadful experience I did. It was miserable having to deal with them, you really can’t trust a word their customer services or complaints teams tell you.
I’m still pursuing a complaint against them with OFCOM to try to prevent it happening to others."

106759,"Virgin mobile, from overseas that lady was treating me so badly, I never like to shout at any human bean and she was shouting at me and repeating her words again and changing the volume speaker as I am diff unable to hear her, I had to record her. I wanted to upgrade my kids 2 sim cards and remove my x partner cim card because she use it and I paid for it and my contract has expired a long time ago.
She asked me for my current account, I always pay in time never light monthly but she said she want my bank debit card and she sit my payment monthly direct debit and even though I did not upgrade my kids sim card and I asked her to remove everything no upgrade and cancelled my kids sim cards for good because I will look for better customer care who first respect their jobs and do what they been told by their companies to do. Sadly she sit my bills by direct debit because she has my bank details and also sit another direct debit with virgin media without my agreement I even told her again that I wish to pay who I always pay online monthly.
I told her I have recorded her and I will give a copy to virgin media and she started repeating SIR SIR SIR and she just cut me off.
And I found out virgin mobile first time they took my money by direct debit for my 2 sim cards and the 3rd sim card that should be long time removed and she charged me for 3 sims cards. I phoned again another lady answered again from over the seas and she was laughing did not stop and she gave me her name the same name and I said have I spoke to before and I asked her why she is laughing and then she changed her name to different name and I asked her to make sure to cancelled my sims cards and remove the numbers which is she said within a month and I agreed and my kids now has new sim cards and better price and 8 times better data monthly with no contract.
I told her virgin are good but you the one who makes bad name for virgin and they pay you. I've treated you with respect.
In fact I am house bound due to my health and I wanted to do the right thing and complain and even send a copy of the recoding to virgin mobile or even in the media for others to hear about this lady who made me so stressful and sit direct debit for mobile and virgin media without me know anything and I contact virgin broadband and I asked why that women sit direct debit for both virgin mobile and virgin media and I have received an email from virgin media. They looked in the system and said last time I contact virgin media was more than a month and there is no agreement with virgin media about direct debit and virgin mobile is different but I have the email maybe she did send it to me so that I leave virgin media to and to put me under stressful.
I had to change my bank cards that she used.

It’s understandable to be slower because of Covid at the moment but it’s not really an excuse for a service to be this bad, especially if someone’s paid a lot of money!

We used to have a rolling contract to watch tv and sports, but their greed has driven us away and we only pay for what we need now. Your loss NOWTV!

138746,"Having been with BT for a long time I am now out of contract ( but they still want 30 days notice) I received an email saying they had some great deals as my charges would increase by CPI+3.9% in March.Well they weren’t and we’re more expensive.It also said that deals including landlines “ are on the next page”.There wasn’t one.
So I called BT this morning and asked about it and was told that I was better off staying as I am but they could offer a £10 reduction but this would still rise by nearly 10% in March getting me back to today’s price.
I said I would now look elsewhere and the reply was “ok”
No effort at customer retention whatsoever!

UPDATE
See below for BT response and I would comment:
1. My issue was the total lack of any interest from their team
2:The fact that their so called great offers are not better.
3. Whilst I accept that they have no direct control over inflation (although they contribute to it) to simply say” we charge this PLUS 3.9%, so over 9% is inexcusable and they,along with others are ripping people off.
All I wanted was for someone at BT to show a modicum of interest rather than “ok,bye”"

186876,"I have spent over 12 hours on hold and on the phone with advisors over the last month trying to sort out a home move. TalkTalk fudged transferring ownership of an account from my friend to myself, so said they would cancel his order free of charge. I was already a customer at my old premises so I went through their retentions & home move departments who offered me a suitable and discounted package for their new gaff (in retrospect, I wish I had and just found another provider).

TalkTalk proceeded to cancel the new order I placed at the new gaff a month before I moved in without informing me, cancel the service at the old place so I could no longer go through retentions process to be offered the same contract I agreed to AND cancel the service my fiend had previously at the new gaff, so there's now no internet here.

The sales person I then got through to on the day the service was cancelled (I was urgently trying to get the internet back up as some of my housemates work from home) lied through her teeth. I explained that until midnight that day, they provisioned FTTP/'future fibre' to this new gaff, so I would go ahead with this (objectively worse) deal as long as they could just reactivate the WiFi services immediately on the line that TalkTalk had installed 8 months previously. The sales rep assured me that this was possible, but they would have to book a provisional live date 3 weeks in advance as standard, and then transfer me through to order management to amend this.

I spent a couple more hours on hold waiting to talk to someone at this department. I was eventually informed that the sales rep lied to get her commission and that live dates categorically cannot be amended (despite the fact that no engineer needs to come round to install the 'future fibre' infrastructure). I'm now left without internet for 3 weeks despite the fact that all they need to do is flip a switch and reactivate broadband on the line that they installed 8 months previously.

None of the departments coordinate with one another, they don't leave detailed enough comments so the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. They have a monopoly on certain areas so you have to go with TalkTalk unless you want ADSL (copper line) broadband. They have no incentive to improve their processes and seemingly no regard for their customers. There were a couple of individuals that I spoke to on their retentions and order management departments that were sympathetic and honest about the fact that I had been swindled, but that is the most I can say for this company.

One of those ones where you've been done so dirty you feel to compelled to make a trustpilot account just to slag them off on the internet."

Literally.i can't order via the app as it keeps on telling me to register as my previous orders were via phone or post.i registered but the app then insists I've already got an account which I have.i have placed orders in the past via phone. I just rang twice and tried to place and pay for an item over the phone only to be told I could do it and then I was told I couldn't by 2 different people. I was told I was a cash customer which I know and told to go to the app.i asked why I couldn't order and pay over the phone and was told to order online and then come back to them to pay.??????????

136995,"The most atrocious customer service.

Day 1 of using BT: Engineer goes to the tenanted property and installs the router at the furtherest corner of the property, inside a bedroom leaving big parts of the house without service (the house being a simply two bed terrace house). I call BT customer service to explain my problem and they stated this has nothing to do with BT and it’s Openreach I need to contact. I call the number BT gave me for Openreach and an automatic recording says that Openreach have closed their lines. I call back BT and explain the issue. They apologise for sending me down the rabbit hole and they advised that I need to contact Openreach via the website. Openreach response time is 5 days. This means that I have to be located in specific areas in the house to be able to use the internet - the living room is not one of those - for the week, with a new internet service provider.

When I called and spoke to BT customer service about cancelling, they were quite happy to cancel without a single worry.

I contacted BT and it was they who organised the shambles engineer to install the route. It should be BT who should contact the engineer to get this sorted, not the customer.

Btw the speed is far below par than the one promised.

Thank God for the 14 days of cancellation period. Searching for a new internet provider right now and so should you if you are looking to join BT.

Might sound as an extreme, based on the service provided so far from BT in my case, every 1 star could well be completely justified. Stay well away."

Repair was made worse. 21 July received text saying they were working hard to obtain the part.

Instead of upgrading my account they created a second account. I had no idea until I saw I was being billed twice. Customer service are completely useless.

I had been in all day and my front door was ajar until their last proposed delivery time ie by 8pm. DPD HAD CLEARLY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DELIVERY IT TO MY ADDRESS.

I recently moved and was sold the fibre broadband package. I had to wait for 2 weeks for an engineer, who told me there was no fibre in my area. My house is already equipped with the copper wire which simply needs to be activated. However, placing this new order seems near on impossible. This was their error and has cost me thousands as I work from home and need the internet and a phone line. I placed my original order 4 weeks ago and I cannot see me staying with this company. Time to find another supplier."

197672,"I was with BT for 5 years. Initially, things were ok, but then one day, I can't even remember why, I called them up for an issue. On the call, they explained that they could halve my broadband bill, and it would be no cost to me. Great!

Confusingly, an engineer turned up the following week. He couldn't really work out what was going on, and nor could I, but he had a look and left.

Turned out his job had been to install a 'second' broadband line. Why would anyone want that. So rather than paying half, I was paying double. OBVIOUSLY this wasn't something I'd asked for, nor could it 'possibly' have been a misunderstanding.

Sorting this out was not quick. At all. Customer service were immediately understanding, from the word go, apologetic. And yet it still took forever.

We then had to temporarily (9 months) move house, and took the broadband with us. During the move, we were given a mini hub, which was vital because we didn't actually get broadband for a while, and even then the engineer had to be a bit shifty, because there wasn't actually any BT infrastructure, it shouldn't really have been sold to us.

Moving back, we were told our old property, that we'd been in for 4 years with BT, could not have BT broadband installed. They thought maybe installing a phone line might change that on their system so that was booked in, and a second mini hub was sent out. (Because the first one wouldn't work?) The mini hub didn't work. I called, and was told ""Yeah, it wouldn't, because your move has already happened"". Sort of defeating the purpose. Was told she'd send out another one, but this proved to be a lie when I called again 2 days later, and finally, a third (!?) mini hub was sent out.

This ALSO didn't work, but at this point it had been 48 hours since getting our phone line, so figured I could just phone to get our broadband back up, since I was already paying for it.

Thankfully, somehow along the way, unbeknownst to me, my broadband contract had actually been cancelled (which is possibly why the third mini hub also didn't work, so much for 'always on').

Pretty opportune moment to change providers, I feel.

The vibe I get is that the customer service reps just don't actually have enough power, or are crippled by inefficient systems and red tape. The things they say, and attitudes are always great, but then the actions, the physical outcomes of calls with them is ALWAYS universally terrible."

142779,We had a tumble dryer delivered yesterday by Team Knowhow - We always await deliveries with some trepidation as our kitchen in up a rather steep flight of stairs. The delivery team could not have been more understanding and managed the delivery without fuss or complaint. The only reason not 5 stars is that is was impossible to contact Team Knowhow and Currys before the delivery to advise them of the delivery issues. Being told that someone would contact us prior to deliver that never happened. This is unfair to all parties concerned.

Next stop for me is the press, so other people don’t fall victim to there false promises.

Original post
Delivery of a fridge and cooker to my…
Delivery of a fridge and cooker to my 77 year old mother who has moved into sheltered accommodation has been cancelled this morning, and moved to 8th February, another 11 days. That is another 11 days on top of the time she has already waited with nothing to store food in and nothing to cook on. She called me in tears this morning.
After two calls to Currys’ call centre I still don’t have an earlier delivery time. I was told that all they can do is email the delivery depot with a request for an earlier delivery. They wouldn’t give me the number for the depot, i was told there wasn’t a manager working I could speak to, and they couldn’t give me a number or email of a manager. I’m just appalled.
Currys, how can you leave a vulnerable pensioner in this position? I’ll take her a hot meal today, what happens to other vulnerable people who don’t have someone to call on their behalf?

Do NOT purchase anything from this company!!! They are a complete joke and waste or time! They are not 'quick or a 'fix'!! I don't think they even have physical phones to sell.

I waited 3 weeks for a refurbished phone I ordered back in April as my own broke - I was originally told 7 - 10 days until I receive it. Chased couple of times when it didn't arrive and was told due to COVID they were short staffed and to be patient. So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and allowed more time.

After the 3 wks I contacted Quick Mobile Fix again only to be told there are problems with phone and I would have to wait another 10 days or so or I could get a refund. Opted for the refund as I was completely phoneless (ordered another phone elsewhere which was super quick), they said refund would take up to 14 days. After the 14 days every week I checked my account and no refund appeared and chased them each time only to still get due to COVID there is a delay in refunding you. Ended up waiting a total of 7 weeks for a refund of over £100. The customer service phone line for them never worked - bit suspicous... Surely if refunds take this long then they shouldn't be open as a business. So the whole process took 10 weeks of my time and unnecessary stress. They do not live up to their name of Quick Mobile Fix!!!"

I was in fact trying to leave them at this point but the new contract price was too attractive. However, the new contract was never put in place, in fact they put me on a more expensive tariff, which I didn't spot for some months. When you speak to customer services they acknowledge the discussion and agree I should have been on the lower price, they promise a remedy but nothing changes. They overcharged me by £120. To cap it all, I terminated my contract more recently within 1 month, leaving the contract to run until the very end of the contract and yet have still been charged a termination fee which I shouldn't have. Three's Customer Service appears to be about maximising revenues, rather than treating customers in a far and reasonable manner. Please avoid Three at all costs."
140970,Horrendous customer service. Ordered an item in plenty of time for Christmas and it didn't arrive despite GHD constantly ignoring the 10+ emails I sent which ultimately led to me requesting a refund which was also ignored. Product was held up in UK since December 3rd. Phonelines never opened and when they were I'd be cut off. Eventually had to buy product elsewhere which came next day delivery and left me out of pocket. Extremely disappointed with the service and definitely will not be back again.
132408,"Kept fully up to date with order and item was delivered quicker than expected.
Would definitely order again from this company."
156797,"Would give a zero if i could. Absolutely shocking customer service. My elderly mother was sold a contract with id mobile from this company. She then cancelled it months ago. She has been chased and threatened for payment by id. Carphone warehouse have basically washed their hands of dealing with this in any way. My mum has contacted carphone warehouse numerous times and has been told it is cancelled. Carphone Warehouse have NOT cancelled this at all. They are causing undue stress and anguish to my elderly mother. This should have been dealt with months ago. My mum has written complaint letters. She is now being completely ignored.
This is absolutely disgusting and abhorent behaviour from a company who sold her the contract. Therefore my mums contract is with them not id. Carphone Warehouse should be ashamed of themselves. I will be contacting trading standards, cicas and ofcom about this. Totally and utterly useless.
Customer service is non existant. They have NO morals!!!"

153318,"I ordered several items of clothing from very for a Friday delivery. On Friday there was a knock at the door which i opened to find the delivery guy holding a relatively small package. Bearing in mind i had order 19 items I assumed the rest would come in a separate delivery. Upon opening the parcel ( which had my name and address on it ) I discovered that not only was it something that i didnt order , the slip had a different customer number. I have contacted Very several times to sort this out and just go round and round. So a week later i am still missing £300 worth of clothing with Very not having a clue about it !! Not happy at all is an understatement."

135842,"Three was pretty good back in 2018-2019 but now in 2022, it's terrible. The UK customer service center is in India and the complaints department once in Glasgow is now in India. Very frustrating talking to robots. Overall just cheap service."

171365,"They made a good repair of the phone and it was value for money. The packing and postage was easy. The reason only 3/5 is because it took several weeks where as their website suggests a turnaround of a few days. There was also no correspondence during this time, which had me worrying that I'd been scammed!"
170264,"I am very pleased with the product I purchased.
The web site was easy to use, and my order was very easy to monitor and/or alter.
I have had to drop a star because the 'build status' tracker proved unreliable. It still showed 'pre-production' even after 20 days. I had a web chat with a very nice person, and lo-and-behold, it shipped next day.

Utter rubbish, Carphone warehouse you should be ashamed of yourself conning people out of there much loved phones whilst selling the new models , anyone reading this buy your phones from the Apple store and avoid carphone warehouse , I will never buy another thing from any of there stores or online and I will tell everyone I meet about this shocking experience , I have asked for my phone to be sent back to me , Absolutely disgusting behaviour"
145793,I subscribed for a 14-days free trial for two passer - Cinema and Entertainment- but got charged for the Cinema which I didn’t even use while still on the FREE trial. Then I contacted customer service and they came out with a lot of bs excuses as to why this happened. Haven’t received a refund or anything. First and last time trying Now TV. Awful billing and customer service. I would recommend people to stay away from this company if you want to save some headache. Spend your money elsewhere.

At Christmas they sent a brush costing £20. It got lost by Hermes.

So I emailed them six times with no reply.

i finally called them. They sent a replacement.

Today I have just been told by EE that I have been charged £32.43 for that phone call to GHD due to the nature of the GHD premium rate number. Which isn't mentioned on on the call.

The brush has cost me over £50.

Absolutely disgraceful. The fact I had to chase and call and now have been charged for chasing them."
174685,"They are just straight up scammers. Forced me to get a phone number. (that I never ever used) with broadband, the contract was meant to be for 12 months but guess what? The phone number had a separate contract for 18 months and I've had to pay a cancelling fee when I wanted to cancel my broadband after 12 months when they've started charging me twice more for it without notifying. Also their engineers never ever came on the date they were meant to come, for example when I was moving which meant that I was left without internet for weeks before they finally arrived. And I've had to take a day off in my new job only to learn they won't be coming. A complete joke of a company."

136014,"Washing machine and drier delivered on time and within a few days of ordering, however despite all the COVID measures on their website. Two men entered our home with no masks before we could stop them. So I doubt they didn't use hand gel either. No idea of social distancing luckily we managed to move back up the stairs as they came through the hall to deliver the machines. Can't get through to them to complain over the phone so leaving my thoughts on here. Machines are all working perfectly so far, all have been Clinnell wiped as has everything that was in contact with the items."

124878,"They use yodel, who still haven't actually delivered my item even though i paid 1 day delivery. Its now been nearly a week. CHECK YOUR COURIER FRIST BEFORE ORDER. First time I made a purchase from the site and Ive paid over 300 for a GPU for it not to be delivered. Not necessarily ebuyers fault, but not great."
171300,"I got a call from carphone warehouse as my contract is up for renewal. I do actually appreciate these calls as I'm a touch forgetful of renewal dates.
They told me the deal, and agreed a renewal on my contract. After hanging up I check their website to find the same phone and tarrif almost £10 cheaper. So I call them up and say to cancel the order as I'm not happy that I've been given a price more expensive than online. They say they can't cancel as I've done it directly through the network, which I didn't as car phone called me. They send me to the network and the network send me back to them.

They are adamant they can't cancel. 5 calls so far, passed from department to department and I'm still awaiting a team leader call back, which I can take a good guess won't happen.

They finally said it can be done but only by the outbound telephony team, who won't actually call back to action that.

Given 14 days cooling off but not actually allowed to cancel. I would recommend avoiding carphone warehouse. I find them to be completely dishonest even when it comes to a cooling off period, they won't honor that.
Also apparently they have no complaints department.

All the replies from the company on previous reviews tell them to call. No point calling when they refuse to help!"
136310,Good service. Part was correct part as ordered and delivered when expected. Would order from BuySpares again

161512,"Everything is laid out and easy to understand. The model of appliance and whether the part they sell will actually fit really works and as a 74 year old and bad with computers, that's really important! Arrived when they said it would and it fitted. How good is that! Many thanks."
115707,Perfect apart from delayed delivery time. We would use them again.
176436,"I agree with all the negative reviews. Absolutely useless. I am trying to get equipment moved. It has taken months and they keep sending the wrong engineer.
I email consumer-resolutionteam many times but they don't even acknowledge receipt. Avoid any company with 'British' in its name.

Edit: so I contacted BT via FB and their response was: we can't do it fill out an open reach form. This is despite BT telling me in September that I can't do that and it has to be done through BT. They also told me multiple times they were liasing with OR to get it done. So even worse service via FB.

Edit 2: finally BT said they'd sort it and an Openreach manager would come on Monday. Of course, no one showed up.

Edit 3: BT just called to say they can't do anything and everything they've told me in the past is wrong. So I've spoken to about 7 BT employees and I'm skeptical that the last one is correct.

I've wasted hours on this dealing with this lousy company."
159028,Super easy to use and instant payment to my account using the kiosk - completely takes the hassle out of selling your phone!
178395,I’m not sure what’s going on with my bills as more than once I appear to be being charged for more. I pay by direct debit was in £300 credit but now they’ve taken most of the credit plus my direct debit for a bill that wasn’t even that much as I was on holiday last month & not at home as much. Also energy prices are meant to rise in January Shell always give me higher bills just before the price rises (they did it last time also) then up the bills again when the actual price rises kick in. Changed from Green energy last year not by choice and my energy bill was more than double then boom price rise so bills increase again. Not sure what Shell are doing but pulling random numbers for gas & electric each month when the usage is roughly the same isn’t good. Also constant harassment to get a smart meter if I wanted a smart meter I’d get one but don’t after reading all the reviews that you pay even more. Absolute rip off
157222,"Was kept well informed of my delivery. If anything probably too well informed (about 9 emails and 5 texts). Arrived on time. Delivery crew polite and courteous.
Only thing i would suggest is use of a blanket of some form to place on floor when using sack barrows with dirty wheels. Was only a minor thing that didn't affect overall experience.
Good price.
Will certainly consider using again for my next large appliance."

194638,"Team Knowhow, not likely. Should be Team Knownowt. A disgusting service and lazy fitters. I purchased a new cooker online and took the option of having the old cooker removed and the new one fitted. I was given a delivery date of a week later. The engineer ( and I use this term very loosely ) turned up and took one look at my cooker and said he could not touch it as he was not a gas fitter. I spoke to Team Knownowt who apologised and re arranged for a Gas fitter and an electrician to attend on the following Thursday ( another half day off work ). The engineer came and again looked at the cooker and refused to touch it as he was an electrician and good not disconnect the gas hob. I again spoke to Team Knownowt and they again re arranged for their specialist team of a fitter and electrician to attend and fit my new cooker. The "" A Team "" turned up which consisted of a Gas fitter and a young lad who was there only to assist in the lifting. The Gas fitter disconnected and removed the old cooker ( apart from the parts left in the rear garden which I had to dispose of.) But would not fit my new cooker as he was a gas fitter and said I needed a terminal box fitted before one of their Electricians would touch it. I arranged for my own electrician to attend and he said the so called Team Knownowt engineer was talking a load of crap and he would only have to fit a slightly heavier cable for the current load. I am still owed the cost of the installation from Team Knownowt and I beg you please avoid these Joker's as the name implies they Knownowt."
121924,"On the 12th June I contacted BT and arranged to have my broadband and telephone line transferred to them. Arrangements were made for Openreach to come and set up the broadband on the 24th June. I had to reschedule the date so I phoned a few days later to rearranged for the 3 July. However, Openreach contacted me on the 17th June by text to advise they would be visiting on the 24th June. I contacted BT on the same day and was told that the visit on the 3rd July had not been processed but they could reschedule for the 5th July. The engineer phoned me on the 24th June to confirm a time for his visit despite me contacting BT to change the date and time.

On the 25th June BT contacted me to say the 3rd July is a Saturday which is a non-appointment day so an appointment with Openreach could not be scheduled. However another appointment was booked for the 27th June. I received another text message to say the 3rd and 5th July is not available so they had booked an appointment for the 2nd July.

On the 27th June I received a text message to advise me that my order had been cancelled. I phoned BT and was on my phone for over an hour trying to rectify their multiple mistakes. No one at BT gave an explanation of why my order had been cancelled and I was told I had to reorder.

On Friday 2nd July, I received a text message to say BT needed to book an engineer appointment to get me connected and that I needed to make contact to arrange this. I contacted BT and again booked this appointment.

On the 5th July I received another email to say my order had been cancelled. Again I phoned BT and asked to speak with a manager on several occasions and this was refused. I was told my order had been cancelled and they did not know why but someone would phone me on the 6th July between 8-10am to resolve the matter. I did not receive a call from BT on the 6th July but phoned BT and was told I needed to reorder and was informed that an engineer would visit on the 13th July.

On the 7th July I phoned BT again and was told that the date the engineer would visit was the 27th July not the 13th July and again I was not told why. I was given another date of the 20th July.

On the 9th July I received a phone call from BT informing me that yet again my order had been cancelled, and again they were unable to explain why and said I needed to be put on hold where another team would support me with submitting another order.

I have been in contact with BT on almost a daily basis for the past 3 weeks and have been on the phone for over an hour on each call. The service received has been extremely poor. I have been refused the opportunity to speak with a manager and I have not been given any explanations as to why there has been continuous cancellations and failures from BT. My orders have been cancelled 3 times I am without broadband and a phone line which is needed to enable me to work from home."
156433,"Didn’t get the package I was promised Customer Relations useless
Complaint still NOT resolved"
196645,I phoned BT today and only had to wait 10 minutes before a lovey guy answered.It was so nice to talk to someone who knew what he was on about and he was very understanding as to why I needed to cancel BT sport.He was so polite and nothing was too much trouble.I wish more companies had people like him working for them it makes life so much easier.Keep up the good work BT.
191685,Easy and fast service. Excellent
171664,"Absolutely shocking service. Disgusting and they blocked your phone number to stop you from contacting them when items are missing from your order. I will be contacting all relevant watchdogs/authorities to report you. You can not be allowed to continually get away with treating your PAYING customers like this. Just on reading the reviews it seems that you just don't care. You're the worst delivery service there is and simply refunding my items instead of correcting the issue and redelivering the missing items is not sufficient. You are a service that promises to deliver items to the millions of customers who order through you. But instead of correcting the issue and ensuring that your delivery drivers can go back and pick up the missing items, you simply BLOCK customers phone numbers from contacting you!! Absolutely shocking service/customer service/company. All you're interested in is raking in millions of pounds from service fees and delivery fees. That is simply theft when you're not efficiently producing a top class service that runs smoothly ensuring that the customer receives all their items paid for and if not, have a system set in place so the customer can contact the relevant bodies for a redelivery! But no, instead, you choose to BLOCK your customers phone numbers and completely ignore them. I will be taking this further. Companies such as yourself need closing down. You treat your customers like rubbish.
Shocking service. I would give zero stars if I could! Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!"

One memory module was not working but it worked using only one, albeit slowly. I decided to buy a pair as the laptop was quite old and I like to replace them in pairs. Now it is running well. They arrived next day which was fantastic. Thank you so much Mr Memory from myself and my friend."

124969,"I rarely write reviews but I am so annoyed at the state of a multi-million pound company's shoddy websites, apps and service in general that I've come to write about it in the hope that it will change.

I am both a mobile contract and broadband customer and everytime I need to get in touch with three about something, I just end up wanting to throw my phone at the wall in frustration. There are so many glitches on their website that there is just no point in even having one. Logging in is ridiculous and always takes me to a register page where the page loops and I must provide my number up to 5 times before the system realises that I am already a customer. Then when I access my account I can only see my phone plan and nothing to do with my broadband. And another cherry on top of a fantastic experience with three I'm now receiving letters telling me that I have been moved to a debt collection agency when my bills are all up to date and I am still a current customer of 3. I rang them to double check I didn't owe anything and they assured me the matter had been taken care of, yet I am receiving letters still. I just can't wait until my contract ends and I can go anywhere except three this is honestly been the most frustrating experience. Last month I was in a Barcelona with no data at all and was stranded in the dark for hours, after being on the phone with an advisor for 1-hour in the airport, who assured me I could start my journey as my phone services would be resumed the same day day.and I was left to drive through Spanish countryside with no maps or GPs or service to even call anybody at all all until they sorted it out the next day and gave me a feeble apology. It's just absolutely ridiculous and if you can find another provider other than these cowboys then I would do. the concept they have is very good but it seems their technology is just not able to keep up."

195855,"The parcel was well packed, and! Lo! And behold!,,the courier actually delivered it to the door of our second-floor flat! claiming it was ""no problem"". Hermes, etcetera, please note!"
175785,"Took out phone insurance through carphone warehouse 2 years ago, have just bought a new phone and so wanted to cancel this as I no longer need it and it has been expensive to not use. Have had my cancel request denied 5 times which is quite frankly laughable if anything. When I tried to call I got through to an answering machine, which again is laughable seeing as it’s 10am on a Friday morning. Eventually just cancelled the direct debit so good luck to them. Not sure how they are at actually insuring something but I wouldn’t sign up if you ever want to leave."

I have waited over 6 hours on the phone trying to get a update on a TV repair i tracked the repair on line it says please ring us The repair Policy says repair or replace after 7 days its now day 12 without a tv WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY
DONT BUY THE POLICY JUST SAVE THE MONEY EVERY MONTH"
157908,"After spending countless amount of money on bogus leads where you purchase a lead within minutes of them being posted and not having no response whatsoever, I've now reported bark.com to trading standards. The clients should pay for posting the requirements that should clear out the bogus leads. The leads are so bad that in one instance I got through to a minor and had to leave it at that as she did not have permission from her parents. Disgusting replies from customer service. About 90% of my leads have to go through to customer services and they mostly don't return the credit saying since the details are valid I can't claim the credits back. You can't write scam in policy.

Same copy paste response. How do you justify a verified number goinf straight to voice mail literally within 10 minutes of lead being online with no other professional contacting them? No responses to emails or sms. This is a joke.

Purchased this lead a few days ago straight after with verified number and I have never been able to ring that number

101332,I know their internet service is not up to standard but from my experience being with 3 it has been absolutely brilliant up until now.I will have financial issues they understand and will never let me down until they resolve the problem not suspending my services and even they've suspended my services and I had an arrangement with them but still didn't pay they will help me and switch it back on.My experience with 3 is WONDERFUL.I am being treated like family unlike EE shoved me off like I was a nobody.didn't give me a chance even though I explained my situations. Love 3 will remain with 3and will definitely switch from EE to 3.BEST NETWORK EVER. Thank you to all the staff that makes my life easier. Blessings to all of you.continue your GREAT WORK.🙏🌹❤⭐👍👌

128846,"(November) last month my contract were finished and I start looking for new provider because I was paying £42.00 so I had to give cancelation time for one month after then I called virgin again and they offer me new contract for £32.00 and reduce my package which to have 125 Mg instead of 250 Mg and give up my kids package but I clearly asked the lady to keep my international calls as it is, they have record of that calls and they can check. As I am pensioner I need to reduce my outcome.
Few days later I have message to say that I am only have few minutes left in my account, I called 5 times and every time I had to explain to outside UK call center what happen and that I am mislead to new contract wrong and every time I want speak to supervisor or manager and they answer he will call you back and they never did and at the end the next day I called and young lady called Bry that the name she gives it to me and she stayed long time on the line and she said she is with the Manager and she will give the package as requested which is unlimited international calls for £32.00 plus give me the broad band as before 250 Mg I said can you send email to confirm and she said it is clear her in our side and the manager had confirmed the deal. I said ok thank you then today I have my bill charge as £42.00 as per my contract, there were no discount of £10.00 I am really fuming no supervisor or manager to call me and all lies to me is any one in charge and speak to me, just go check you telephone conversation please and do what you promise in telephone conversation."

Would advise taking your money elsewhere. Please don’t reply saying email us because you never reply unless you get spammed with multiple emails sometimes respond after days if you want to resolve my issue. You can send my phone out With a tracking label with next day delivery as promised

116182,"Sales team only want to take your money and do NOT do the full checks. Customer services do nothing. Senior advisers hang up on you and do not call back. In fact, no one calls back, even the complaints department!! Tamping!!

Brought a new phone/contract with O2. Was told everything will work fine... haven't been able to use the phone at home AT ALL due to a known network issue (this is going back since I took the contract out back in June).

Could not use phone at home from day 1 as signal dropped in and out.

Rang CPW and was initially told to exchange phone. Note, phone works in other areas so it's not a phone issue!!

Researched online and found out there is a mast issue in my area. Spoke with O2 who advised to contact CPW as they should have carried out a network status check (they didn't). If they did carry out this check they would have known there are issues in my area and I would NOT have taken the contract out with O2.

CPW say they carried out coverage check and I should be getting 2G, 3G and 4G (indoor and outdoor). This is expected, but they failed to carry out a network status check which would have shown there are known issues in the area. CPW are claiming they are not liable...

Have rang numerous time and keep getting fobbed off saying that I should be getting 2G, 3G and 4G!! I know this, the issue isn't with coverage, it's with the network status!!!

Calls getting disconnected when I speak with CPW (how strange), they don't call back!! They could at the very least try calling me back. Have to call them back each time and they very rarely keep records or take notes of calls.

Have now been told as it's over 14 days since my contract was taken out there is nothing they can do...

DO NOT USE CPW!! Go direct to service provider, at least they know if there are issues and will advise.

158840,"Hi I recently posted a review here with regards to my, still unsuccessful attempts to cancel my contract within my 14 day cooling off period. Carphone Warehouse advised me to contact them and I did so, I included all the relevant information. I still haven't heard anything back! I would just like to warn anyone thinking of using them now that they basically have no effective customer support right now, so if anything goes wrong you're screwed!
They are saying their systems are down and they can't do anything. I have asked them if they could alert me when their systems are back up and running, they have refused.
I have asked them whether they will compensate me for the massive inconvenience they are causing me, they have refused.
I have made a postal submission to have my contract cancelled, they haven't replied.
I have to contact them every morning now to see if their systems are back up and running again so they can process my cancelation. In the mean time I will be footing the bill for the unwanted phone contract, I asked if they would compensate me for that, guess what, they refused.
I think they are among the worst companies I have ever had the misfortune to have to deal with. I would strongly advise you to shop elsewhere, you will pay dearly for any bargains you bag here!"
130800,"AVOID !!!!!!!!! virgin media is the worst broadband they promise the world and deliver zero i cancelled my contract early and now they want me to pay i will be going to Ombudsman !!!!!!

115050,"I just bought (amongst other items) a MSI motherboard. When I started a build with it I found the motherboard was DOA (dead on arrival).
I got in touch to arrange a refund and after sending some requested pictures of the CPU socket was told in no uncertain terms that there would be no refund as I should have known the CPU socket was faulty!!
I'm a customer of many years and have spent thousands with eBuyer over the years and can't believe they'd treat anyone so shabbily.
When I buy a brand new item I assume it should work straight out of the box.
To be told the item is defective and it's my fault is no way to treat a (up to now) loyal customer.

UPDATE - So it appears that whatever I say to eBuyer it's still my fault that the motherboard arrived damaged and for the sake of £58.08 they're going to lose a loyal cutomer who has spent thousands of pounds with them over the years.
What a way to run a Company!"
136524,"My wife and I made a deal for a new contract August 2021 /23,for a Nokia X 10 (both hand sets).The deal looked so attractive for refusing it.After a month the hand set became crazy,all the application gone,you can't get access your files,even making a calls.They said to us you need to call Nokia services??!!Eventually they know what they are doing..it turned Nokia had a so many faulty hand sets,made a deal with three to make of them so called ""best deals ever"",so Nokia & three made a huge profits & pressure & lost to the poor customers as us.
We manage to get a new deal proposed by Three,have a guess *WE WILL GET THE SAME HAND SET*Means the faulty Nokia X 10.Because our 15 days exchange has unfortunately expired?!?!It was well calculated by those giant crooks.All what I am asking is where is the offcom to protect the vulnerable customers?!we manage to go to a private repair charged £ 95 each,been told they are faulty & they won't take more than 1yeay & we wished he was not correct.On the 4th of may 2022,they collapsed.I called them to make a complaint,they said they will send a replacement on Monday the 9th.I called them we never had them when we will get them,they said ""we had never promess you on Monday the 9th we have to check the system again?!?!?Guess what Nokia X10 again.we know that any phone call is recorded!! They denied.
We have been for more than 15years with that rubbish company,with the most lowest lower internet signal( British statistics)we lost a lot customers orders because of their rubbish signal and they admitted.
WE WANT A REFUND NOT A FAULTY HAND SET.PLEASE AVOID BY ANY COST."

What used to be an honest company a few years ago has turned toxic.

Offered £585 for an iphone 13. Sends it it special delivery, gets an email saying the phone has ‘multiple issues’ (dark spots on lens- despite never having a poblem with photos, ‘multiple scratches front and back etc’- it had 1 small scratch well within their tolerance, I took pictures too as had a feeling they might try it on after when I sent my ipad to them 2 years ago.) Due to the ‘problems’ they’ve found it’s affected the value and offered a paltry £180.
I rejected and their ‘retentions department’ emailed within a few hours having ‘re assessed’ the condition of my phone and were able to now offer £310. Needless to say I rejected and got the phone sent back. Arrived back still in it’s immaculate condition despite them implying it was scratched - had. horrible feeling they’d damaged it based on their email!!

Just sent it to O2 recycle and got £520 which they offered first, funnily enough, not a problem with it!

I signed up to their Full Fibre package as they had an incredibly cheap £25 deal, however it then when up to £35, just after it was installed, without any explanation.

The service I paid for was 900mbs but I can only get 300-400mbs. I've spent hours on the phone trying to resolve this and running test after test but they won't accept it, they say that everything is fine their end and that it must be my laptop or the cables (which I've changed) or Windows that's causing the issue.

Then I get another email, within a month of joining, that the price is going up again by 9%!! I've tried to cancel but they won't accept, saying that I'd have to pay £600 to cancel.

So basically I'm stuck paying for a service that I don't get for 24 months and they just don't care!

I'll never get anything from Vodafone again."
129021,"2+ year long nightmare. If you thinking of going to Vodafone for a contract (or anything else), you need to take a cold shower and reconsider. Despite paying for the fastest 5G package, in 2 years I never even got 4G despite frequently travelling around the UK. If I am lucky enough to get a response to this, they will probably reply to this and claim I wasn't in an area covered by 5G as they don't seem to really read or listen to complaints but like I said I didn't even get 4G. I am now on PAYG with another service provider using the SAME iPhone and get perfect 4 and 5G so despite HOURS on the phone over 2 years and speaking to their stupid Tobi robot they still couldn't sort it out. It gets better...when I gave them a heads up I wasn't renewing (for obvious reasons) and confirmed I wanted them to cancel my contract they never did and I've had to phone about 10 times over the last 2 months to try get this resolved. It looks like they have FINALLY managed to cancel my contract and I was offered a whopping £40 refund despite over paying £1000+ for 5G when all I ever got was 3G. This company is absolutely useless - no reason to take a contract out nowadays - You can get a new iPhone through Apple interest free for £30 quid a month and then pay an additional £10 a month on PAYG (with anyone but Vodafone of course) for 20GB data, free minutes and texts, no lock in to a contract. Vodafone can get in the bin. So glad I am free from their rubbish mobile and customer service. 🖕🖕🖕"

After two months I've been notified that the order was cancelled without my knowledge . Now the same product costs about £60 more than i paid for it two months ago. And after hours of arguing, i got small recomapensation for lies and fraud. This company is one big scam and I would never recommend buying anything from them. Customer service had no problem lying to me every time i phoned. After such a long time, I should be getting these products for free, and all i got is small compensation that I'm still waiting for, and god knows if I'm going to get.

In response to your reply, firstly my name is Nicola. Secondly no it hasn’t been delivered. Dpd have said they have delivered it and marked it as delivered to a neighbour. However they have put delivered to DA at my door number with a photo taken from a moving car of next doors house which you can clearly see has no package on it.

It was too big to fit through my front door, but they spent the time to delivery it through my french doors.

They were very accommodating and understand that I was alone in the house and couldn't get it in the house without some support

So thank you for spending slightly longer than you are meant to helping me out."
166412,Great customer service. Reasonably priced leads. I wish it was more direct leads from Long Island than the city though.

159554,"Having exchanged messages and spoken with BT over the last few weeks I was confident that today I would get the Fibre broadband that was promised.
Lost of messages ensuring I would be in between 1-6… so I took a day off work (at quite a cost to me personally).
I even, stupidly, cancelled my EE mobile dongle.
Only for no one to turn up.
No text or phone call.
And when I called to find out what the situation was I got a horrendous response.
All blamed on Open Reach.
And offered 31st January as an alternative!!!!!!!
The person I spoken with at one point admitted that they could send an EE mobile dongle within 24 hours but wouldn’t because it wasn’t part of the process.
It seems BT are not capable of getting an EE dongle or the Fibre I really need by midday on Monday (nearly 3 days).
So the process is designed to get customers to leave.
Am left feeling that I should have followed my neighbors advice and opted for Sky.
Very very disappointed.
I understand that appointments can’t always be fulfilled. But communication and a willingness to help the customers through their disappointment could be easily achieved.
Yet appears to be no interest from BT to do that.
I will certainly review my relation with them and my company’s relationship too."
130906,Applied for a phone contract. I did not get approved on the network. Carphone Warehouse called me saying they can help get me onto another network to get me my phone. In the end they ended up sending me two sim only contracts with virgin that I didn’t even need. Why would I want a SIM only when I actually need a phone? Ended up paying for 2 SIM cards that I wasn’t even using - they told me it is going to help me build my credit score and in 3 months I’ll be able to get the phone I wanted on contract with them! That did not happen! I have completely lost trust in the company now
133409,"They are so good at the Leeds Branch and come up trumps every time ... my latest buy was only £299 for my grandson in Scotland.
He will be thrilled when its delivered Deck,Amp,Speakers what a bargain!!!"
150253,"I wish I had read all the awful reviews on Trustpilot before switching to vodafone for broadband and mobile (a card for gigafast was put through the door).
I'm not surprised (unfortunately in hindsight) that vodafone remain at the absolute bottom of these league tables for mobile and broadband providers
Chaotic and expensive service (especially gigafast) and murky mobile monthly plans with potentially huge (and hidden in small print) additional mobile upgrade costs.
Profit clearly above service provision.
I note the review below commenting on their policy towardas UKrainian refugees.
Only 7% of 15,564 reviews give them 5 stars.
I have now cancelled, paid early termination fees, and will never use them again."

161407,"Whatever you do don't buy anything from here. I knew curry's had bad customer service, but it's actually criminal now. They take your money for a cancelled order then won't refund you the money. I have contacted them about 20 times! It goes abroad where the person who is clueless says they have raised it to another team, then you end up contacting them again because nothing has happened. Continue this for 3 months and I still haven't got my refund. Absolutely disgusting service. I don't care what the sale is, for your own sake don't buy from this terrible company."

159147,"Amazing service from the start, the pc performs flawlessly and has been great so far. I will definitely be staying on board with PC Specialist"
178813,"Ordered a phone. Never even left the depot. No communication from them at all. I had to use my work phone to phone them as mine was broken obviously, hence when I needed a new phone.
First phone call -they're systems are down so phone back.
Tried to email but they just kept emailing back asking for my address (even though this had been given to them) with two days in between these emails.
Second phone call - oh yes we will deliver by Friday
Friday passes.
3rd call -We will deliver it to you in two days, and I'll send you email confirmation now.
Never recieved.
4th call - you will recieve a refund in 3-5 days.
No refund received.

These people have wasted hours of my time just trying to get what I paid for. Now they seem to just be dodging paying me a refund.

The single worst customer experience I have ever had. I suggest if you want a phone just go to a shop and get it. Preferably not a car phone warehouse, because if anything does go wrong their customer support team will do absolutely nothing to help you."
190444,"Buying from a small retailer rather than one of the huge companies is so much nicer and a more personal experience. I felt like I was buying from a family business. I bought a DVD player from the Preston store this week and from the outset I felt that my custom mattered. I wasn't spending hundreds of pounds, but even so James gave me good advice and helped me to make my decision. He did not try to push other products, which is good and I know if I have issues I can go back there and get support. The four legged assistant in the shop may have helped too. A really good shopping experience."
133996,Great customer service although had to contact 5 times to sort out an issue with not recieving the replacement link. The issue was eventually sorted out.
100090,"Worst customer experience i have ever dealt with.
Months of back and forth, queuing to speak to advisors in person who say everything is all sorted again and again for each time issues to continue. I was billed the wrong bills for months with never a penny refunded or any help. Spent hours on the phone or chatting online to advisers and each time they would promise it was all sorted for the next months another bill to roll in. Even after begging for them to just close the account they make it almost impossible to leave. Would never recommend to anyone"
161825,"I wanted to give enough time to really give my opinion on the GHD Helios Professional Hairdryer. Too bad they only give you 3 weeks for returns.

As a hairdresser I pride myself in the finish of my services. I find whenever I use this hairdryer clients are left with so much frizz.

One of the usual GHD problem being the setting are just TOO hot.

Yes it drys the hair fast, which for in salon is a perfect touch. But I find the setting so powerful I’m blow drying the client in the next chair.

I do like the sleek packaging & fact the nozzle doesn’t move unlike the original dryer which would spin constantly.

I have it a while to see if the cause was the brushes I was using. But best compliment I got from a client on there blowdry was when I was using a different make of hair dryer!

I thought this would be my hairdryer till it dies so I got it engraved, shame I now can’t sell it on unless they have the same name."

167606,I can always trust the 2nd hand quality from Wex. It really encourages me to recycle.
193918,"Response to Bark's reply; To the owners who decide company policy, trying to portray Bark users as fools that don't know the basics of business or are lacking in enough common sense to use your platform is extremely condescending, and it does not take away from the fact that you sold me leads for projects that were completed before I purchased the lead (I have proof). The projects were not completed AFTER I purchased the leads due to my incompetence (according to you), the projects were completed BEFORE I purchased the lead. Since we can only agree to disagree, let's allow a judge to decide if is ethical and/or legal to keep selling 'expired' leads.
Sincerely
Emanuel

Original review; I've wasted £130 of my hard earned money to buy leads that have already expired, I received confirmation directly from several leads themselves that the projects were already completed. Bark management does not care at all, as soon as your communication turns to a complaint then they just ignore you. Sadly for me I've wasted £130 at a time that my family needs it most. Shame on you Bark."

126968,"FURTHER UPDATE FOLLOWING BT RESPONSE

Do not trust this “contact us through twitter and we will sort you out” nonsense. This is just the standard BT PR lies and distraction kicking in. I had never used twitter so (in desperation) I decided to give this a go. To be fair it does mean that I now have a dedicated route in the Customer Services BUT like ALL the other Customer Services people I have interacted with, they are pleasant, sympathetic and TOTALLY powerless against the ‘BT Machine’. The machine which is clearly designed to maximise profit at the expense of Customer Service.
We have now had no service for over SIX WEEKS. Four weeks ago, I asked for the service to be put back to Copper (which had worked previously). I was first told that this had been done, and was then told that it hadn’t been done, that it was (quote) “impossible to go back to copper” and the team confirming the reversion should never have sent the confirmation out! A week ago, I was told that they had decided to temporarily put us back to copper (it seems like BT can now do “the impossible”) and that had been ordered. Four days ago, I was told that they had only ordered the decommissioning of the Full Fibre and, once that had been done, they could THEN order the Copper to be re-instated. Yesterday I was told that the decommissioning of the Full Fibre had failed and they would try again in 48 hours!! So.. BT are so incompetent that they CANNOT EVEN REMOVE A SERVICE THAT ISN’T WORKING ANYWAY!!
My Wife and I are both pensioners and, as I have told Customer Services on many occasions, my wife's father is very ill and keeping in touch with him is very important. We have poor mobile signal where we are and with no landline this is proving very challenging and stressful for my wife but.. hey ..as long as BTs idiotic processes need to be followed, who cares ?!
I will be writing to Age UK today to highlight the disdain that BT have for its potentially vulnerable Customers.




ORIGINAL REVIEW

Would give BT 0 stars if it were possible. The worst company I have ever dealt with. We have been without Broadband or Landline now for 6 weeks !! We opted for Full Fibre and it has NEVER worked. I estimate that I have been on the telephone or chat for over 7 hours over the course of the last 6 weeks. We have had 5 engineer visits booked with only 3 actually turning up. All said exactly the same thing “nothing wrong with your home setup.. it is an authentication issue .. we will get it escalated” and NOTHING has happened. I raised a complaint on 1st November and BT (despite knowing that the fault is still there) have closed it three times I keep having to re-open it . I assume this is so they can fiddle their stats with Ofcom ? I have reported this to Ofcom"
105492,"Ordered a spare battery and UV filter for a trip leaving in a few days so speed of delivery important. The standard delivery was very quick and turned up the day before I was expecting it. As usual, well packaged. Can always rely on Wex."
150601,"Great service, great offers and super delivery too.

Highly recommended. It was so refreshing to deal with a company that does what they say they do…. Brilliant guys 😊😊😊😊"
148962,"The price was certainly competitive. Delivery was faster than expected, 48 hrs from placing order to receiving phone. The phone was more than adequately packaged and worked straight out of the box. The phone was as described and set-up was as expected for an iPhone. I have experienced no problems with the phone since set-up. In short it has worked perfectly.

I have never used this company before but would certainly use again and recommend it. Well done QMF excellent service and product. 5*+ rating from me."
104846,"Kristen Bodnar of Kiki's Cleaning took total advantage of me and my situation. I am a profoundly depressed individual with mobility issues. She not only quoted $280 for 6hours. She was going to clean the really messed up floors but also dust, wash the sink and counters, do the bathroom and the bedroom but also do the hanging of clothes and some other organizing. She did a passable job on the floors with many breaks, she moved piles from one place to the other. She did a little work in the bathroom. But never dusted. Not only did she not clean the kitchen, but she left a bigger mess in the sink. Than she wanted much more money and she wanted to fight about it. Because my landlord is paying for her services out of my account, they don't want to get involved in a whole thing, they have told me that they will pay what they are invoiced for. If this is Bark, stay away."
198689,"I paid extra for the 2 day delivery, it has been a week and my order has still not arrived"
125949,Everything from ordering to delivery was without fault
196426,The battery failed just as the warranty expired. I was asked to try a couple of trouble shooting actions which showed the battery had failed and new on arrived the next day. Exceptional service from Gtech
195141,The worst customer support agent I have ever spoken to. She kept insisting that she could not help without numbers which were not available on my invoice as insisted they should be. She seemed to resent me asking for more details and then came up with totally inaccurate information. I did not believe her and fortunately managed to find the information elsewhere.

Reply as usual,just generic not bothered as usual."
183822,"We received a damaged cooker hood and immediately re-packed and informed customer service.
Have spent ages in queues to Customer Service and have sent e-mails asking for item to be collected so damage could be assessed by company. Excuses of staff sickness, busy time of year etc.
Explained we are in our 80s, husband has lung disease and is very stressed by situation, but no action (from October to January so far).
This is our worst experience ever of purchasing an item and our advice is AVOID THIS COMPANY in case ""customer service"" is involved."
125466,I never knew about this app until I apply to be a Brandbassador for a company. This app is very helpful and it explains everything I need to do. It also gives me other companies that’s looking for Brandbassador‘s. This app is very simple to understand on how things work. I appreciate this app so much.
187030,This is my third order. Excellent service and quality. Website easy to use too. This is my go to site for Thank you cards.
102395,This is for any customer wishing to use Carphone warehouse services. I bought the latest iPhone package with latest iPhone and Vodafone contract. I changed my mind and cancelled the next day and never received the phone ! The upfront payment for the phone of £350 was immediately debited but after almost 3 wks nothing has been refund and they also debited £50 from Vodafone without any usage! Not customer service to solve over the phone! Worse service and would never recommend them to anyone
125665,Came very quickly and exactly what I wanted. I’ve never used them before but will have no hesitation in using them again

188879,"We ordered our purchase on line,we got a text to tell us when it was in stock.all straight forward."
190526,The customer is treated with smarmy contempt told what they wanted to hear and nothing is done. I have been a customer for 28 years which as far as respect is worth nothing. they put the price up at any opportunity give you something you don't want and charge you for it. A mugger gives you more respect than Virgin

152963,"I bought an oven wire shelf which I wasn't able to get anywhere else unless for a horrendous price until I came across BuySpares. The site was easy to navigate & I found what I needed immediately. The process of paying was easy too.

So as you can imagine - I’m a very happy customer - Again :)"

118328,Ordered through these for my father in law who's washing machine broke and the service was excellent as always. We have used AO a number of times so when he saidyhe needed a new washer we went straight to AO. Found an excellent deal and ordered straight away.

184909,Brilliant! The item is as I have expected and quick delivery.
156858,"Would be no stars if it were possible.

I placed an order for 4 personalised matching items. I did not wish to open a credit account and paid there and then.

I got an email 2 days later saying one was out of stock. So, poor stock management from the offset.

With me now only able to receive 3 out of 4 matching items… I requested to cancel the order as it was no longer as per my request.

I got an email back saying personalised items can’t be cancelled as they are made at my request. Again, I requested FOUR. Getting a similar item elsewhere would mean it would be similar. It wouldn’t, however be MATCHING the other 3.

I have worded it to them as many ways as I possibly can and all I get is the same response from a different person each time (with each of them using the other requested matching items product descriptions as the email subject).

So, I now am to expect 3 unrefundable matching items with one person unmatching. In the grand scheme it was just for a nice bit of Christmas fun but, actually, with the expectation of spending almost £100 elsewhere for everyone to match… that’s that idea out the window.

They refuse to acknowledge the fact they advertise these items as MATCHING FAMILY items and clearly, from Twitter posts and other reviews I understand they do this often- allow orders for things that they do not have.

Communication is awful. Understanding is awful. Service is awful.

In addition to this, the packing and sending method for one order is horrifically wasteful.

All round terrible company. Was a first and last time using for myself and considering they are the type of company to cash in on people needing to purchase things on credit, I’d be very wary of using them and using one of the other, far more reliable companies who seemingly actually train their customer service staff.

STUDIO- don’t bother pasting a generic “contact us” message here to pretend it is any use whatsoever. If any of you bother to read what people write- they already have contacted you- hence the reviews.

EDIT: of course they’ve requested more information to be undoubtedly just as unhelpful with. (Had to provide otherwise my review would be removed- lolz)"
176851,If you visit Curry’s Burnley try an find 72 Madeleine. An absolute star ⭐️. Proper knowledgeable and helpful.

136795,"Awful service! Ordered a phone & money immediately taken. Contacted by quick fix mobile offering me a different phone on 3 separate occasions. Rejected this offer 3 times but offered a different phone again. Clearly they are selling products that they don't have in stock. Have contacted customer services 3 times but have had no response. I'm now seeking a full refund as I have no confidence that they can fulfil the original order. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!
Update....the company has responded within hours to the above review but as yet haven't responded to any of the multiple emails sent to their customer services email address regarding my order. I reiterate, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!"

151404,"This is more a reflection of packaging rather than the product or the service. It was packed with excessive single use plastic. There is no need for this as there are plenty or reusable/recyclable options available. I've been a regular customer, and apart from that I have no comlplaints."
166387,"Virgin Media ignored a cancellation letter from my mother when moving into an old folks home, even though the initial contract had ended.

I then went on live chat, the advisor was worse than useless! Kept saying he waited 15 minutes, yes but two streets away! This didn’t seem to matter that only that he tried to deliver, doesn’t matter it was wrong street! Then had the cheek to say they wouldn’t be refunding as he tried to deliver! Absolutely ridiculous, then to add insult, asked if anything else she could help me with! So beware if the driver goes to the wrong street as unable to read street signs it’s your problem not theirs.

All in all would absolutely recommend to anyone wanting a new phone at an affordable price, cannot go wrong with these guys! Also I found they're prices are cheaper than other companies in the market offering refurbs.

Very smooth buying process as always with Richer Sounds.
I've been an R.S. customer for many many years and this transaction was no different.
The online PayPal payment made the transaction quick and easy."
199250,Very efficient service my order was delayed for a bit due to stockage shortage but then my order sped through all the stages to get to me as fast as possible.
141325,The app is amazing! It gives small creators an opportunity to try new things. I really recommend this app.
136651,Brilliant service. Over and beyond what they offer.
121636,"So just recently booked in and had fibre 900 installed. Fantastic right, not for us.

Engineer arrived 3 hours past the time so waited in all day and had a time slot for nothing.
Once arrived he fitted and explained we should have a new hub, this is the smart hub 2 which we already had. We was told when we upgraded that we already had the equipment so they won't need to send out equipment. When I rang them to tell them the engineer said we needed a new hub. The lady quickly told me that we had the correct hub. Anyway installed and left and we was still only receiving our old service off 45mps.
When contacted again to bt. They told me that it can take up to midnight for services to go active. As soon as phone disconnected, we lost all Internet connection. Called the next day and went through to technical. Explained what the engineer had said and done. Explained he said we needed the newest hub for it to work. She then said that she wished engineers didn't interfere and that we have the latest hub and that's not the problem and she will send out engineer.

Engineer arrived today, onetime. He straight away said we had the wrong hub and that's why it's not working.

Now to get this right.
There are two types of bts smart hub 2. They both look exactly the same however one has a red wan port on the back. If yours doesn't have this. Then insist bt needs to send you a new hub because otherwise you'll be without Internet like me. They are now sending me a new hub however if they knew their own equipment in the first place I wouldn't be left without Internet. As we all know Internet runs everything now. I have 3 children, no sky, no cctv working because it uses Internet. I wished they listened in the first instance and just sent me out the correct box needed for this new fast Internet they provide. They did offer me £20 as compensation however the missed appointment alone should be £26 according to their own website. Plus loss of service plus compensation. I just hope when this new box comes. It works ?
I must say previously we have had no problems with bt. Just wish they listened to customers telling them what their engineers relay. Maybe we would of got Internet back on sooner.

Just be sure if your upgrading to the new fast fibre,that you have the correct smart hub2 with the red wan port on the back and this can be all avoided



**UPDATE**
So I contacted you like you asked via Facebook. However after speaking with ""Garry"" he is denying to talk to me regarding the account saying that I'm not on there as a listed person. I have been speaking to you for the last year and I'm defiantly on the account.you even send me texts and emails. I even just phoned in to double check and they confirmed that I'm on the account. I have never really experienced any problems with bt, but maybe people on trust pilot are right that when you have a problem with bt, you are not willing to sort it out."
151470,"I used CEX's Drop & Go to sell an Oculus Quest. I was quoted a good price for the item online and I dropped it into their Gloucester store on the following day.
They took the item, but no payment was received within 3 days, so I chased for an update using CEX's online contact form. Customer service emailed me to say they were contacting the store in question for an update.
The following day, 4 days from the date of dropping the Oculus into the store, I receive an email saying I will be paid almost £100 less than quoted, then another email saying payment was cancelled, and then ANOTHER email saying I will be paid even less!
CEX have failed to follow multiple of their own rules stated on their own website: They did not properly process the Drop & Go on the day, they did not contact me in any way to confirm the substantial drop in price or grading, and payment was not made within 1 working day.
Of course there's no way to get a response from CEX immediately, so I've had to submit another online contact form to try and resolve this issue.
AN UTTER SCAM AND EXPLOITING OF THEIR CUSTOMERS!"
112197,"My wife ordered a dolls house on Black Friday and the item never arrived

This was the main present for our daughters birthday. Studios guided delivery time was 5-10 days so I allowed plenty of time to ensure this would be with us in time. Studio only dispatched the item after 13 days and then the courier of choice for them ‘Evri’ never delivered. Therefore, completely missing my daughters 4th birthday!!

We attempted to contact them with numerous attempts but with very little progress. Eventually when we did have contact with them, they could only offer a refund, therefore we had no dollhouse for our daughter, and it was impossible to find a match for this at this time of year.

My wife was contacted by them via phone call, however, she was I the middle of something and asked if they could call back 2 hours later (which they agreed to). We heard nothing else from them."
149440,"They always deliver top notch experience. Shopped there many times, never failed me. Always prompt free delivery, great prices, most of the time had all that I needed, rarely I had to look elsewhere.
Keep up the good game."
149243,"Ordered it under a week before Christmas and came the day before Christmas Eve. Package was in excellent condition. Product is LOVELY, works very well (or so i have been told) and the emerald case really makes it excellent for a gift!"
181613,"Works a treat, great service from Mr Memory."
194847,"Just really hard to deal with… too many automated responses…
All I wanted was a catch ordered well before Christmas…. Arrived on Christmas Eve, in a 48hr envelope… but according to the people I dealt with, it was dispatched on the 14th….

150157,"I was wondering if Vodafone listens to their customers frustration over the network issues. I remember Vodafone used to have one of the best 4G coverages but somehow it's all gone downhill one they rolled out 5G. I live in an area where 3mobile 5G speed goes to 400mbps indoor and Guess what Vodafone speed is, 30mbps. What an UTTER SHAMBLES. There's nothing on the network status checker online and I've been checking every single day. 50-60% of the reviews are regarding network issues here and yet I doubt the company is doing anything about it although they're eager to take the money on time. The services are way below O2 at the moment. I've been telling people to avoid this network at all cost. Pay a bit more but avoid this at all cost."
181784,"I liked the product, the price & the delivery time. The price of the item went up as you put in delivery, re cycle etc but that's normal now.
The item was delivered at the stated time, we'll packaged & in good condition.
However, it is stated that 30 minutes before delivery, the driver will call. This DIDN'T happen, the delivery time was 0700- 1000, at 0650 the door Bell rang, the item was here. This didn't give me any time to disconnect the old washing machine, the drivers said well we can't wait & it's meant to be disconnected. I agreed but said where was my 30 minutes notice? It's early & people have complained about ringing early, so we don't was the reply.
So the old machine was left, 10 minutes later it was out & in the garden but no drivers to take it away.
A trip to the tip was in order.
Getting refund of the recycling cost was difficult, I had to basically repeat that it was stated about 30 mins notice twice & get a little forceful before I got the required refund.
All in all this ruined an otherwise good experience, which I have had from this supplier numerous times in the padt"
186251,I bought two rams. Delivered on time. Great product and customer service.
153085,First class experience with a very helpful and friendly person. Many thanks for the call taker !
143386,Easy all round experience would definitely recommend
146015,Matched every expectation and absolutely love it!

127067,"The system was very easy to use and upload photos onto. I was lucky enough to take advantage of an offer at the time to reduce the cost. Delivery was on time and the product was just what I was hoping for. Some of the pages had stuck together but, luckily, they all came apart easily. Brilliant, thanks Snapfish!"

187108,"Very good service. Nothing to much trouble, for the two delivery men."
134794,Fantastic service every time. FFX is always our go to when buying tools and equipment. In the Shetland’s we can experience post code discrimination with delivery but NEVER by FFX. Can’t rate them highly enough.
140289,"Constant signal issues over the past few years. They 'fixed' FOUR transmitters near me a couple of weeks ago and gave somehow made it worse. Useless customer services, who are not employed by Vodafone, but use an American company to handle calls, along with banks, media companies etc. Half struggle to understand, and they don't care.
My phone signal comes and goes constantly, it almost impossible to use the Internet, on both my contracts. What exactly am I paying for, and why is it getting worse (even after a fix!).
If you live in/near Guildford NEVER choose Vodafone. My friends, on Vodafone, ALL agree.
The most incompetent, greedy company I've ever had the misfortune to use.

Oh and ignore the custmer service responses on here. More lies and fake platitudes - if they meant it, things would have changed, but they haven't.

EDIT: I received a text to say the area's 4G and 5G has been boosted. No, it works less than 50% of the time now. What a great boost. Having taken it further, yet again, I was told it was congestion. All of a sudden, after upgrades and boosts to the area we amazingly have congestion. Utter rubbish, it's blatant traffic management, known as throttling. You are blatant liars, as thousands of people have said on here. And your checker never works, just like your customer service. I'm cancelling both of my contracts with immediate effect. Never, ever, ever again.
Oh btw their call centres are mostly farmed call centres that aren't their own staff and also answer calls for energy companies, retailers and banks. Greed.

Everyone I know on Vodafone, in Guildford/South London, says exactly the same thing."
139428,"Finally , I won the battle and they accepted to replace my laptop, however I declared another war to get my E-voucher 😠🤦😭😠.
We are in 21 century and teamknowhow still needs at least tow weeks to process E-voucher 🤦.
#TeamKnownothing."
124341,"Good service, helpful and quick to respond. Answered my queries with ease."
171229,"Never again! I ordered my dinner, eagerly waiting. Then I got a notification that the driver couldn’t reach me and deliver my food. He claims he called me on the app so no refund and no re-delivery. I can prove he didn’t. He never even rang the bell. Isn’t that the first attempt to make a delivery? Ring the bell! Not rocket science. I am wondering who is eating the food I paid for. Absolutely unacceptable and outrageous service."
150548,Swift and helpful service. Would definitely use this company again. One useful to for people wishing to upgrade their computers with extra RAM. There are some useful videos on YouTube Do please remember you can add extra Memory but you cannot mix and match so for example you cannot combine 4gb memory cards with 2gb memory cards. Now my computer is running on two 4gb cards and is much quicker in operation
124061,Took awhile to come however make sure you read the specs correctly I had to buy a new Graphics card a 720 won’t run games at more than 70 FPS please please please look into graphics cards and research
176353,"The worst and inhuman company ever. I have lost a member of family and being in a difficult situation emotionally and financially. I asked them to help me with the cancellation fee by talking to so many people from company but I came across with not human but machine which only trying to rip you off . I would never get back to this doggy company and would recommend any one not to have a contract with them. They don't care if you are in an emergency situation they just squeezed you as much as they can to get more money out of you.
The mangers are the worst who do not show any sympathy to you."
129722,"I was very impressed with the professional and courteous way in which the Shell operative Seth Martin dealt with my enquiry. He was extremely polite and knowledgeable, and understood my question straightaway. What is more, he gave me the answer to my question almost immediately, and helped me to understand my energy usage much better. My conversation with Seth Martin was friendly, cordial and informative, and has greatly improved my opinion of Shell Energy as a company. The fact that they are employing helpful and efficient people like Mr Martin gives me encouragement. Also, I made a comment about the website which Mr Martin immediately noted and referred onwards. So 100% for customer service. Thank you Mr Martin, and thank you Shell!"

188298,"So easy to purchase and arrange delivery on line. Great follow up phone call and emails to confirm details. The chaps who delivered my range cooker were really pleasant, professional and knowledgeable about my purchase and instructed me re. using and caring for my cooker. They fitted it carefully and cleaned up afterwards, also removed all the packaging. Altogether a great service. We'll done!"
120053,"I bought a S21Ultra5G and it has some problems with mic ,gps antenna and battery . I brought it back after using it 10 days,2sellers double checked me about hits scratches etc before sending it to repair,repair kept it for 40 days and when they sent it back surprise my phone it’s full of hits&scratches. Now the display it’s ruined. And I refused it . Why it couldn’t be a simple repair??now they’ll keep my phone for another 30 days they said for investigations. Now everything it’s so complicated. Curry’s needs to improve sending expensive stuff in proper packaging and repair centre back to curry’s as well!! YOU CANT SEND A 1.500£ phone in a rubber pouch like a makeup one as a packaging! Well done repairs! Luckily I took photos of everything always so I can proof now everything and if I’ll have problems with this department I’ll happily go in court"
158489,"Deceitful company, stated despatched, but wasn't until 5 days later, make all excuses under the sun and fail to send confirmation of transaction and order, plus they procrastinate like hell when you ask for refund. My advice, is avoid and use more reputable company, fortunately paid thru PayPal so pursuing claim. In one word USELESS"

Review of Three UK


Leaving after 20 years for Lebara mobile
Leaving after being a loyal customer since 2007, didn't really want to cancel my contract today but 3 have continued to remove services but increase prices over the last few years.
Final straw was the greasy pig behaviour of complete downright dishonesty, advising
its customers they would still offer EU roaming, then in a tandem,greasy pig pincer movent,
remove the roaming and offer extortionate roaming rights in their place,anyone who stays with three ,must have a serious problem.
I have signed a 1 month rolling contract for a fraction of the price
and offering EU roaming free!!!
A thoroughly disreputable company which I will endeavour to point out to any foolhardy taker of their services"
166576,"This is the first (and won't be the last) purchase of refurbished tech. Very happy with choice, speed of delivery and quality of the product"
176143,Cheaper than my local store and prompt free delivery. Well packed. Sorted thanks
133288,"Appalling customer service, currently 5 weeks without broadband, disjointed and lack of effort response from them, no end in sight"
128757,"Was not aware of company but Fast delivery, good price will use again"
185998,"The product was just what we had asked for.
We paid extra money to get the cards on the Tuesday, but they did not arrive till the Wednesday very disappointed in Royal mail the extra money was returned. And I have given 4 stars as the product was perfect"
162529,This app is so easy to use and i love the accessibility to every feature. I am very new to this whole experience and this is very pleasant.
131692,That’s very interesting and useful. Love this app❤️❤️
122164,"Terrible customer service, I went elsewhere"
135188,"Driver Dawid refused to help get our built in oven into our home- constantly quoting “I have 8 minutes to deliver “!! Due to packaging it was far too wide to get through any door. Me and my 71 year old husband had to unpack it outside and struggle to get it inside due to the weight. Totally disgusting - attitude much!!!
Update - customer services have been supportive and have arrived at a reasonable outcome in recompense due to the situation created."
138473,"Delivered OK, contents as ordered. No complaints"
106864,"My first Iphone
I bought my first Iphone from quick fix mobile and I’ve never looked back. I ordered a good condition re furbished IPhone 6 which came in mint condition and quick delivery,within weeks i ordered my daughter one for her birthday then my mum one for Xmas gift and were all delighted with the product. I have upgrading ever since. My nephews ended up with my first couple of phones and they are still in great condition. Well pleased"
115416,Easy quick process only note of caution is to make sure you delete the sample text. Last year they printed it because I wanted to leave the card blank. They replaced them though no problem.
160482,"Upgraded my iPhone on November 9th. When I got home the contract I had on the phone was not the same as I had been sold in store. It took a week and three visits to the store for the phone to pick up most of the information from my previous phone and messages has not picked up at all. My phone would not lock. I went back to the store - an 8 mile drive and costly parking - 5 times before they phoned EE who explained what was going on to both me and the sales assistant but no one in the store could sort out the locking problem and I was told to take it to an Apple store as Samsung had software problems! I pointed out that I had an iPhone but was repeatedly told of Samsung’s problems. I tried to persuade them that as I had got the phone from them it was their responsibility but they insisted it was not. Eventually, on December 9th, I drove 20 miles to Reading Apple store who corrected the locking problem in less than 30 seconds with one click to the settings. This just shows the lack of knowledge of the staff in this store."
110205,"Excellent on time and as described no scratches, battery has full charge highly recommed"
107388,"What great service best I have had in the computer business. Great communication. Very well packaged. Arrived on time via DPD, will definitely use again for any computer parts! Thank you."
120116,"Everything went well, order-collect, easy."
121821,Diego and all the staff are a great credit to the organisation. I felt enriched leaving! Helpful and sage advice.
129347,Incredibly quick and so easy. I wish I had known about them a long time ago

117586,Lovely garland and ready for Christmas 2023
155002,I wished there could be an option to give them no start . Worst customer services. Even though my contact is completed they charged Me. I had paid for the device and they are charging me same amount . I would never recommend this co . I wished I have seen there views before buying any service from them .
169066,First class service from start to finish. Friendly knowledgeable workmen who had my new oven and hob installed in no time.
151030,"Arrived quickly, was cheaper than everywhere else and the product seems great so far. I really can't fault Hughes so far."
148459,"My departing tenants had lost parts for my rather old meile vacuum cleaner. Rather then buy a new one I looked up parts on the web and found this firm selling a collection at brilliantly low prices. They turned out to be perfect , delivered very promptly and saved me a lot of money, and the one part I did not need for the new tenants also replaced a part I had myself lost on my cleaner at my home."
133903,"The PC works well and I've had no issues with it. The service prior to this was a little delayed, as the initial order stated 15 working days for delivery but it ended up being 22 in the end. It was a birthday present and I just received it the day before the birthday. One of the advisors told me it was going into building at around day 16 and should be with me within the next 3 working days. I rang again after this time period only to be told that it would be another few days as it wasn't built yet. Apart from this its a good pc and I received it in time."
142527,"Really easy website to select goods and order from. Very varied range in prices which is good for everyone. Ability to select delivery day good, I got a text first thing with my 4 hour delivery time slot. Goods arrived on time by 2 cheerful people. Great experience"
181841,"I ordered a Fridge Freezer which was delivered on time and unpacked. Sadly when the delivery drivers had left we discovered it didnt fit into the space available. I called your number and spoke to someone called Jack - he was excellent, polite, courteous, with good product knowledge. He sorted the problem and arranged for the fridge freezer to be returned and another one sent. I requested call backs twice and he called exactly when he said he would. Great customer service from AO and from Jck who is an asset to the company . Well done."
179440,"Absolutely abysmal service. I will never use them again. Delivery was never made. Incompetent driver commented : Address too hard to find! He also lied, by claiming he tried to call me and text me. Never received no call or text. When I ask them for proof or evidence they say they can not supply any ! They now say it is a good idea to track delivery via the app. But at order time they do not mention that, or that you have to go out with a hi vis jacket on and some lights and flags to help their incompetent driver find you ! Refused refund. Trading standards are involved. Thieves and liars. Do yourselves the favour, use some other delivery service."
102932,"Just received light weight joggers they are the most disgusting joggers I have ever had the displeasure to receive. sadly, I couldn't be asked to return them, my problem I know.
these joggers will be used to sleep in as that's the best thing to do with them ...... lightweight, creased and not worth even the postage i paid .......disappointed"

145672,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!

i ordered a phone on the 6th February but very stupidly hadn’t read all of the reviews. A few hours after the purchase i realised i had made a mistake and requested a refund. Although the customer service is quite fast to respond, they constantly told me it would come in 5 working days or 10 working days, which was a lie. it is now the 1st of may, almost 3 months after requesting a refund (keeping in mind the phone hadn’t even been sent off so all they had to do was give me my money back) but i have finally received my refund. It is safe to say i am not purchasing anything from this website again and i do not recommend it to anyone."
136786,The detailed descriptions and the range of products is helpful and the best things was that the laptop I chose was £70 cheaper than Amazon! The delivery was quick and as expected with regular reminders.
134403,"Stuff ordered 16 days ago has still not arrived therefore cannot review anything other than delivery. However a quick response with a full refund helped, it appears the packages were misplaced by the carrier. So out of the control of Music Magpie."
187571,worst company I've ever been involved with I gave them 2 months notice they send a load of cowboys and damage my property and install the cable wrong and illegally by having it coming out the pavement and across to my drive they send out guy to do a survey and he admits it's illegal and that they can get sued anyway I wait for them to sort it out takes 23 days and the guys who come do it wrong so they can't complete my final installation because the man hey send is new and can't find the cable he promises me he will come the next day and does not show up the worst thing about this disgusting company is that there call centre's are India and the Philippines and speak broken English and don't know what day of the week it is I have now canceled with this joke of a company and stayed with BT true saying if it isn't broken don't fix it
129054,"I ordered a fridge/freezer and paid to have my old one recycled and the new one to be unpacked and the packaging taken away. When the drivers arrived they placed the item at the top of my driveway and left it by my garage door, picked up the new one and went to leave. I had to stop them and ask if they were going to unpack and take the rubbish and put it in the kitchen for me and they said ‘no.’
I explained that as a 76 year old I was unable to get the item in the front door myself and into the kitchen and I told them that I had paid to have the rubbish taken away so I expect them to take it.
One of the men wasn’t very happy and not friendly at all but after me complaining they did eventually bring the fridge/freezer in and dispose of the rubbish but at my age its not the service I expected and paid for!!!!

Rang to complain and was told new date (would not have known had I not rung, so complained about this).
Was tod that any installation delay would be automatically compensated immediately following actual installation, under Ofcom rules.
This also never happened.
So, still waiting for my compensation - useless!"

Good HD quality items.
Good quality image.

Will definitely use this service again soon"
185974,"Brilliant service, the software for building the photo book is really intuitive and even fun to use, with lots of options for arrangements. I left mine a few times and went back to it, and was never given any cause to worry that it would forget everything I'd done and I'd have to start again. Ordered on the 19th December and arrived in good time for Christmas. Was so impressed we bought another one for a birthday present in January. I would say at the heavily discounted prices it is fantastic value, so personally I would always seek those periods out to create my books, which I'm sure I will do again!"
161237,"This review is for Halid S, not for Shell itself. Thank you for being patient with me on live chat and for resolving my issue efficiently"

167735,"TLDR: Don't even think of spending any money with Carphone Warehouse. The way an organisation treats you when something goes wrong tells you all you need to know.

Absolutely shocking response when I asked for a refund for a faulty Nokia 1+ 2019 mobile phone. They said it's not their policy to refund and that you can only have an exchange. Then they said you can only have an exchange if you bring back the original box. Then when I explained that they can't refuse a refund according to my statutory rights, they claimed that they had offered me a refund and that I had refused it. I asked them to prove that statement by giving me a copy of the CCTV but they've ignored that request. Just a little longer and I will be contacting the ICO about that part.

The service from this organisation is so awfully bad it's been almost entertaining. I've been lied to, ignored, and fobbed off, told to jump through totally unnecessary hoops (write to this address instead of us! Go back to the shop instead of writing to us!), thay've sat on things for weeks on end and have refused to take responsibility for resolution. Maybe they're hoping I will go away if they delay and frustrate me enough but it's actually spurred me on. I am applying to the Courts to get my money back, having written twice to the customer service director without receiving the courtesy of even an acknowledgement. Whilst that won't stop other people from making the mistake of buying from these people it will at least make me feel that I did my small part to push back against a terminally stupid corporate machine that's totally lost sight of its statutory responsibilities. But please don't buy from them. Please.

EDIT: Since writing this review and receiving the hackneyed ""ooh, we're utterly shocked that you had a bad experience, please email us"" response below, one of my two letters to the Carphone Warehouse head office address at PO Box 375, Southampton, SO30 2PU has been returned marked ""gone away"". This was the address given to me by their so-called customer service team. It just adds to the epic saga of utter feckless incompetence. If there were awards for being the opposite of ethical, customer focused etc this is the hands down winner. Avoid."

We were told we were going live on October 12th now nearly 3 weeks later and 2 engineer's not turning up and told it could be another week, I have spent in excess of 20 hours on the phone sat in carparks or coffee bars constantly been told how sorry they are when they don't give a flying xxxx

156180,"I bought a very expensive item from Ebuyer. £1949 to be exact. A considered purchase indeed. If you just want the conclusion to this awful experience then I will state it for you . Only shop with ebuyer if you like to be left confused, in the dark, and have your consumer rights infringed upon.

I bought a very expensive graphics card from ebuyer. They shipped it out quick. Nice. What's not so nice is that the card was faulty. OK so that's disappointing but not ebuyer's fault. No problem, I will RMA it and get a replacement. I start the process and need to call in. They agree, yes send it in it seems faulty.

They receive the card. They agree its faulty. OK so far so good. I am offered a replacement or refund. I ask for a replacement. OK they say.

Then nothing happens, so I wait few days, a few days more. I start to worry about my nearly £2000. I email them and they say item is out of stock. Would I like refund or alternative item. I determine that I should just ask for a refund, and source the item from elsewhere. So that's what I do. I ask for a refund, I am told by ebuyer that my refund is processing.

I source the item I want from elsewhere. Thinking my refund is on its way, y'know to have some hope of balancing the books.

Then guess what happens? NOTHING. So I wait few days, a few days more. I start to worry again about my nearly £2000. I email ebuyer all politely, I would be most grateful if you could update me on the status of my refund...

At this point they tell me that I am not entitled to a refund due to the age of the product....er, sorry what?

I had the card for a week. It was faulty. I highlighted this and returned it promptly.They agreed it was faulty. I asked for a refund. Am I being thick? consumer rights exist, don't they?

So no, apparently. Ebuyer wants to do things their own way. They apparently think its perfectly fine to disregard my right to reject faulty goods and ask for a refund within 30 days, which contradicts law and their own stated returns policy.

They have insisted on shipping a replacement item, now it's back in stock, despite the fact that this is against my wishes and leaves £1949 deficit in my finances.

I have had to force the communication and action process from start to finish so far. Ebuyer customer service is passive and will not action my requests or respond to me without several days delay and prompting from me.

I have been left confused, upset, seriously out of pocket and lumped with an item I have no use for. Ebuyer have acted against my wishes and contradicted themselves and established fact.

So, in summary, only shop at ebuyer if you don't care about your money (in 2022!), and don't want your basic rights respected. Then if something goes wrong, you can enjoy being ignored for days on end until ebuyer gives you an outcome that infringes your rights and leaves you with serious feeling of 'I should have gone to overclocker'.

Seriously though - AVOID AT ALL COST for any purchase above trivial."

180602,"Last week, I found my camera (Nikon D810) to be in a state of disrepair and contatcted Wex's support team, for it was under warranty. While the representatives in contact were well mannered, they were replying for each others queries (there were a total of 4 different people) with clear lack of communication and misunderstanding of previous conversations, leading to multiple mishaps, where after a week of conversing, it was agreed upon to provide a replacement model instead. The length of the messy and drawn out string of events subsequently disrupted my photography and videography, with it being my primary camera. I do hope to find that the replacement leaves me with no more undesirable impressions of the support team.

In future, I certainly hope that representatives either learn to cooperate or avoid intervention of each other's cases."

Devastated, as I not only have let my colleagues down who trusted me with the money, I don't have the £400 to replace the gift elsewhere in time, so now having to pay for it to be shipped half way across the world and explain the situation to the colleague.

When contacting customer services, I was given a repeated... 'this is our process' without any consideration to circumstances or even more disappointing not once asking for any references to look into the order. Also abruptly closed the chat session when asked if it was possible to discuss further with a manager."

198645,"I can not convey how bad my latest experience has been . I recently moved and trying to contact Vodafone is simply breathtaking…….ly bad .
As I’m writing this I’m on hold , I’ve been pushed from Tobi the automated idiot in to other folk online who take on average 5mins per sentence or reply . If I told you I’m now entering the 3rd hour of trying to move and that is just this call !
Numerous other attempts have ended in failure so this is just another attempt
I do not think I will be alive by the time it is sorted out . I’m 60 now and I feel like I’m on my last legs .
Obviously I had to use my mobile as trying to change my broadband and telephone has resulted in me not having a phone or internet and when I started my call my mobile had 95% I’m now down to 25% and no end is insight
If anyone is reading this and I don’t survive the wait please somebody let my family know I did my best and tried till the bitter end .
How hard is it ? Why didn’t I just cancel and take the hit and start again with another provider .
Why have I made the wrong choices in life and Vodafone I’d say is one of them
!
Update
After 3hrs on the phone yesterday they still buggered it up ,
Another 3hrs today online with Vodafone it looks like it might be sorted but seeing as this has been going on since September the 10th 2022 I will hold on and try to believe that it will be right now but who knows
I had to go with these as I am still paying for a phone in a house that I no longer live at so the worry is unbelievable . I have reluctantly had to take out another 2 yr contract to avoid fees but I seriously doubt I will go back when this contract ends and I can not recommend Vodafone to any one .
Ok i had another few hours on the phone with some guys and eventually got through to a guy who knew what was going on
They couldn’t supply the area 🤣 !
What an absolute farce"

I have been buying vouchers from Amazon, which are considerably less than what Now TV charge. The problem was the last voucher I applied to my account which was going to extend my viewing when the current pass ran out. Well just before it was due to come into force it suddenly disappeared from my account so they charged me £11.99. I have told them the code from the last voucher and the approx date I applied it, but they refuse to apply that voucher to my account and refuse to refund my £11.99.
The customer service is appalling they don't want to help.
Go to Netflix or Amazon prime their prices are considerably less than either the entertainment or cinema pass"
136015,"Last July I bought a washing machine from Currys, taking out also their installation and old appliance disposal package. Upon delivery not only the new washing machine was left uninstalled (for reasons never detailed), with a plumber's services cited as 'required' (verbatim), but the old one was (to this date unexplicably) not removed and left lying around the (small) flat for over a week prior to a subsequent, removal-only visit by Currys. The plumber I separately contracted certified in writing that he could see no reason why anyone ""with minimal DIY experience"" (verbatim from his report) could not install the washing machine as he could see no problem with the existing water inlet and outlet connections.

I have since struggled mightily with getting in touch with Currys Customer Services to lodge a complaint for poor service and a refund request for the failed installation and old appliance removal. Eventually a call handler directed me to Currys' (as it turned out severely unresponsive and unacceptably unhelpful) Team Knowhow. After repeatedly ignoring my initial complaint, a rare decent call handler (Mr John) instructed me to e-mail the plumber's invoice to a dedicated Currys' e-mail address which, after 3 weeks of no action, a separate Team Knowhow assistant told me was ""unmonitored"", despite me receiving an e-mail receipt confirmation with reference number which he didn't recognise as theirs. After being told that e-mailing Team Knowhow was not a standard means of communication (!) and I should instead paper-mail my complaint, in the face of having already followed Team Knowhow's instructions to that point, I opted for Twitter communication where, after about another month of ignored messages, I eventually obtained vague endeavours to a 2-week refund that would invariably be disregarded (twice). At that point, recognising that my complaint wasn't being taken seriously I threatened through Twitter legal action through the small claims court for a refund + indirect costs with a two weeks final notice. Wouldn't you know it? Team Knowhow suddenly starts engaging and, by the end of the two weeks, I got my refund. All of this for an uncontroversial, agreed upon refund they would just drag their heels about.

Currys have lost a customer, and possibly more prospective ones I'll find myself telling my story to."
126622,Why do you need money off your next purchase with monthly payments to another company to achieve it. You don’t need this.
111461,"2 hours waiting to connect to an advisor. Horrible experience. Gave up 8n the end. With multiple mobiles and broadband, all with Vodafone, you need a PIN to get a PAC code. To get a PIN you have to use ‘live chat’. Joined the queue and over 2 hours later still not connected to an advisor so gave up. Will have to try again tomorrow. More pain. Awful customer experience. Will cancel the other mobiles and their broadband as soon as contracts end. NEVER AGAIN!"

197997,"14 years I’ve had washing machine cover. 27th May booked a Hotpoint engineer. 3 visited and many parts later machine still not working properly. Knowhow told me to contact Hotpoint to do a write off report. This was done on the 6th July. Multiple phone calls later, each time being told an E-Voucher would be sent. Still nothing. Resulted to Twitter and yesterday got a response. Was told to call Hotpoint to see if the job was live or closed. Hotpoint confirmed they closed the job as a write off report was done. Knowhow are now saying because hotpoint closed the job I have to rebook Hotpoint to come and repair the machine!! My agreement with Knowhow says if not fixed within 21 days they replace the machine!! Nearly 3 months without a washing machine!!!! and because I did as they said I’ve got to start the whole process again!!! DO NOT TAKE OUT INSURANCE WITH THEM, IT’S A CON!!!!
Update 20/08/20 this is what my agreement states: “Sometimes we won’t be able to fix the problem there and then, but if we can’t fix the problem within 21 days you may request a replacement product by calling Knowhow Custer Service” it’s been 84 days and I’ve got to start the whole process again!!

The customer service is completely unworkable…..They don’t understand anything that you say to them and they end up making everything worse and wrong.

169602,"Currently on our second 24-month contract with BT, having also upgraded to Fibre, which has maintained their promised speeds of 8MB. Still haven't fixed our phone line since the first contract, despite getting in contact several times regarding the issue.

My only gripe regarding most broadband companies is their advertising for said internet speeds. This isn't directly targeted towards BT, but many companies will sell their services using Mbps as opposed to the ACTUAL download/upload speeds, and for people who are not tech-savvy, will feel disorientated by the unnecessary conversions.

Beyond that, from personal experience their customer support service has been efficient and straight to the point."

166014,"I ordered an electric cooker with installation and removal of old one. it couldn't have gone more wrong if they tried:
1 - No installation engineer: they forgot to bring the installation engineer which meant they couldn't unplug old cooker as it is wired into the mains. so they refused to take old one away. They left the new one and said i would have to wait at least a week for the installation. With three kids, this was not an option I could take.
2 - Removal of old cooker: I am not an electrician and know nothing about electrics, yet I had to undo the wiring so they could take the old one away. While doing so I told them not to pull from the handle as it would break the glass. The glass broke in a million pieces...
3 - Installation of new one: I was then left with a new cooker, a million pieces of glass and an open wire cabinet to connect the new one. After googling what each cable is I managed to connect the cooker. Took me 1.5 hours (as I didn't have any tools to cut thick cables and crimp them) for something that should have taken 10 minutes.
Do not buy from currys and use their teamknowhow rubbish service. This is the second time it happens. They argue their IT system doesn't record the orders properly online... hardly my problem. I don't get these issues with John Lewis, lesson learned."

Please take these reviews seriously, they are all accurate, also most of them are within the last couple of weeks so these issues at right now and not months or years ago!!!

and then a potential 2 weeks to receive?
Their accounts department apparently don’t have phones that take calls, just dial out, and I’m still waiting for a call back from complaints due 8 days ago, then assured by a senior manager it would be today - no call yet, and it’s 11:35pm,

Dread the moment you actually need their help due to billing or technical issues.

184238,I have been charged twice a month for my I insurance now for over 10 months which I only spotted 2 mths ago! I cant seem to get anywhere. I spoke with someone in Carphone Warehouse who gave me a UK number and was told I would get a call back which I didnt! Then I got the correct Irish number and the girl on the phone said she would have to pass it on to the relevant department and I would get an email back in the coming days....which never happened!! So so frustrating!! I am owed a lot of money now and it's getting stressful!

196164,"The process of ordering and communication was great. I think the delivery drivers need a bit more training on the products they’re delivering. I had a fridge freezer delivered and straight away the delivery man plugged in the fridge, put it right up against the wall and told me it was good to use straight away. Upon reading instructions this wasn’t the case, it was meant to be left unplugged for another few hours because of the compressed gases and it can’t be pushed up against the wall because of the vents at the back. Fortunately I unplugged the fridge after 10/15 mins or so and moved it away from the wall. Something to consider when delivering to people who are more vulnerable and unable to move heavy items."
192051,"Good prices, worked a charm and quick service."
194927,"Would have got 5 stars if they had delivered on time. I asked for a Saturday delivery but they cancelled at the last minute.

Took out a one month sports pass ONE MONTH didn't realise by buying what should be a one off pass I'd signed up to a recurring payment as soon as I realised (2 months later) I cancelled the pass lo and behold one month later another £34 has been taken. There are no phone numbers to contact them and I can't even find an email address. I'm now having to go to my bank to try and stop nowtv from having access to my account.

131791,"I ordered an iPhone 7 for £147.99, was told it would be 7-10 days delivery. These came and went with no contact to say things were taking longer than expected or anything. So I had to ask what was going on and was told it would be another 3-5 days. These came and went, same story. So I asked to cancel the order and was told the refund would take 14 working days but due to covid could take longer than normal. I asked when I could definitely expect to receive my refund and received no reply. I got the money back through my bank as I found this attitude to be unacceptable."
182354,"Absolutely disgraceful that you called during the Queen's funeral trying to flog phones. When I told the operator that I wasn't interested they kept talking over me and ignoring what I was saying. Bad enough to be cold calling but to do it when the world was watching Her Majesty being laid to rest it is beyond disgusting.
Every other company was able to stop marketing during this time."
112116,G tech systems and item good quality. Delivery by DPD was poor. First date they left a card to say they missed us. We were at home. Delivered the next day to wrong house.

102321,In a panic - after my printer suddenly died on me - I trawled the internet frantically trying to find a quick replacement. I found the printer I wanted was available at Wex Photo Video but I’d never heard of the company so was slightly wary of spending hundreds of pounds. A quick check on Trustpilot gave me the confidence that they were genuine and I placed my order. I had a slight issue with booking the next day delivery so called the company and spoke to a very polite and helpful person who went out of his way to make sure my printer arrived the next day. I cannot praise them highly enough and will be recommending Wex Photo Video to all my friends and family. A superb experience! I’d like to say a HUGE thank you to all involved!

Furious.

I was told that I couldn’t pay the outstanding over the phone without a PIN code that would be sent to me by post and would be posted there and then.
One week has past and still no letter - absolute appalling service from a massive company like BT.

I have been to two of their flagship stores recently and the experience was the same. Each had more staff than customers yet still pointedly ignored me. They came over like old school record shop staff, deciding who is cool enough for them to deem to talk to. With such a successful online business I have no idea why they burden themselves with the overheads of staff who have such low commitment to the company."

They sent an engineer who didn’t even come inside the property. He just said engineers don’t come inside. Calls after calls, a paid engineer visit, only to find out that there’s no master socket in the property! Their customer service is so slow to respond, always keeps you on hold for a long time like you have no life to live. And then when you finally get in touch with them, they’re not efficient enough to understand and sort out your problem.
PS : I am still not connected.

Edit: Today, 23rd November 2022, there was another engineer visit scheduled for master socket installation but nobody showed up. I called again and the staff member said they’ll call me tomorrow to sort it out. I am so frustrated by this behaviour. I am going to unsubscribe from BT.

125134,"There is no other word for it, shitshow!! THATS my experience of BT! Fibre ordered, openreach did a great job putting fibre in, all looked great till I realised they had not transferred over my original number which I was clear I wanted to keep after some 30 years. To get it, the order would have to be cancelled which takes a week, by 7th April, then I’d to phone up on the 8th to reorder and be clear I wanted to keep my number, just as I’d done the first time??? Then I’m told there’s no guarantee I’ll get my number back and I might not get the deal I was originally offered either and even if I’m happy to take these chanced there will be another 2 weeks before it will be connected despite fibre installation already done! I went away and thought nope, too risky and I’m not waiting another 3 wks to find out I’m in the same position again, I’ll stay with my present provider. The guy I spoke with at BT when I phoned understood and said he’d send on a Jiffy bag for the router and phones and NOW they’ve sent me an email today, the 8th telling me I’ll need to reinstate my direct debit as my first payment is due on the 13th and I’ll need it in place to make future payments - what the day AFTER the order was cancelled down?? And my account was to be cancelled too?? They are so disorganised it’s like they are new to the business??? I’ve spoken to at least 4 people who have written notes on the account too supposedly, they are not getting a penny from me, I should be suing them for the stress involved!! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER BT!!

Mandy from BT
I notice your reply mentions my not being able to keep my number but nothing about an email about me being asked to reinstate my DD as my first payment is due on the 13th April, for what exactly? I was advised I was not liable for the fibre installation, I have kept my number as I have stayed with Sky, whom BT never contacted incidentally as they said they would. I advised BT on 3rd April I had decided I would not be contacting them to ‘start my order from scratch again’ it is not my fault your system takes a week to ‘cancel the account down’. I also have received the bag and label yesterday 9th to return the router and digital phones, a clear indication to me all has gone as I was advised?? What does BT expect me to pay for exactly?? No money is going to BT, I can assure you!"

Went to my usual store but it was closed down so had to visit a Currys store.

140713,"Disgusting, appalling service.

A company that hounds you to sign up to a new contract/upgrade and has made a fortune out of me over the years because I have remained loyal.

Was convinced by a salesperson to trade-in my old phone and that I’d receive £130 into my bank account within 3-5 working days of receipt of my old phone.

Followed all instructions and returned in the prepaid 48 hour tracked packaging provided. I even got proof of postage just in case.

Nothing. No money, no confirmation. Nothing. That was 15th January. I’ve called countless times, emailed, used live chat. Half the support representatives were okay, half were utterly rude. I’ve been lied to, made to feel stupid, given no help or support other than “can you wait 3-5 working days for feedback from our trade in team”. Guess what? Been told this 3 times now. Told it’s been escalated, told my phone is being checked and the money will be sent to me, told I need to speak to Royal Mail! Despite the fact I have proof of posting and proof of delivery as of 15th January! Where is my money???

I’m being fobbed off over and over, it’s starting to make me feel ill the amount of chasing I’ve had to do and not one single person has given me an answer as to when I’ll get my money and some compensation for what you’ve put me through!

I’m going to pursue this in the small claims court and spread throughout social media that you have essentially stolen my phone and refused payment. Utter disgrace when I’ve done everything correctly and in good faith.

Don't EVER buy anything from the Carphone(y) Warehouse. Absolutely terrible company.
I ordered a sim-free phone online in OCTOBER, which I cancelled by not accepting the order, but I STILL haven't had a refund. I have spent approx 8 hours calling them (they haven't called me once, after telling me that Senior Management would be addressing my issue on 4 separate occasions).
Apparently, the phone was delivered (despite me rejecting the delivery a few days earlier) and signed for by me. I was in SPAIN when they claimed it was delivered.
I was told after approx 10 seperate calls that I would get a refund if I went in-store. My Wife went in and the manager said that is not even something the store are supposed to do, but he'd do it for us due to the SHOCKING service I have had. This will take up to 7 days he said.

I sent in my iPad in as it was charging very slowly. Promised fast fix and delivery (within a couple of days) so thought it was brilliant.
After a week and a half my iPad was nowhere in site. I called them and they said they will see what is going on and call me later that day... 2 days later, no reply.
I call them again and they say the same thing, no reply.
The next day I demand they tell me what is going on with my iPad whilst I was still on the phone. They said they hadn't fixed it as my screen had a small crack on the bottom and the screen would need replacing which would be an extra £50. I queried why they hadn't told me this when they had received it instead of letting me chase them for a week. No reasonable response given.
By this time I was so fed up and frustrated I just wanted my iPad back. So I told them to send it back. They said they would have to charge me £10 which I thought was a joke. They already had my iPad for 2 weeks and I thought the least they could do was send my iPad back free of charge as they had caused me such an inconvenience.
The staff were very rude and smug and told me if I don't pay they keep my £500 ipad- disgusting! I was left distraught and out of pocket.

182423,"Ordered a lovely range cooker from Curry’s. Was delivered by team know how yesterday. Delivered I mean in the broadest sense of the word. Doorbell goes, first word out of delivery man’s mouth is, “we can’t deliver this, you’ve got steps and it’s against our rules.” To be fair to them it was late, there were 3 steps and they had to get on! Leaving an oven on a driveway in the rain is delivered, isn’t it? Two friend later and it was lifted into the house. Took two minutes.
So, moral of the story, don’t go near Team know how. They don’t know how, couldn’t care and when called to discuss referred me to a very small print saying delivery drivers have the right to refuse to deliver!!!! I will not be using Curry’s again and would urge people to buy online with caution."

122566,"I purchased a month of BT sport just to watch a few games throughout May.
Evidently I forgot to cancel it as I was charged this month. Immediately after the money left my account I phoned to cancel and ask for a refund. After going through 3 support employees I have decided to close my account permanently and never use BT services again.

They are saying it is impossible to give me a refund as they can't prove that I won't use the service for free after recieving the refund.

This is a lie. Firstly, I have fully closed my account and it is impossible to log in and use the service.
Secondly, unless BT is the only company on the planet that doesn't keep detailed usage tracking of every customer, they know or can know exactly when I log in, how long for and what I do while logged in.

On top of this, the process to sign up was long and convoluted and getting a straight answer as to what was included in this pass was very difficult. No doubt all of this is to make it easier to accidentally leave your subscription active. (I got so frustrated with the website that I genuinely started dreading going on there at all)

On top of all this, it turned out that a significant amount of the events in May were available officially for free on Youtube, meaning that when all is said and done, I have paid £50 for the privilege of watching 3 or 4 games a month ago and having an extra, wasted month lying around.

For context, every other major online subscription provider would have refunded me. Amazon, all Google services including play store subs, Netflix and even NowTV, a very similar service to the BTSport online pass all have systems to allow refunds in this situation, and you could buy any 3 of the others for the price of 1 month of BT.

Extremely disappointed. I essentially feel scammed and will never use BT services again, and I advise everyone stay away from the BTSport Monthly Pass"

124056,"My family and I moved to the UK in early July. We chose BT as our broadband provider, but after multiple delays and customer service so poor it boggles the mind, we pulled the plug and went with Virgin instead.

We were given multiple dates when our service would begin. Then when it did not, we would call and learn from a representative that our broadband service had been delayed. (Various excuses were given.) That in the 21st century a huge company like BT would not notify us — by email, text, or phone — that a crucial service was not being delivered as promised unless we called them, waited on the line and directly asked about it: shameful.

They tend to push blame onto Openreach. When two techs from Openreach finally came, they stood there shaking their heads and told us they did not know why they were sent to our rental house, as they 'do work underground' and our installation involved fibres and cables that were above ground. They said they were not authorised to climb poles. When we called BT, the representative claimed to have no knowledge of this visit or the issue the Openreach techs were referencing. The rep insisted that we still needed to wait for Openreach to do its job before we could get service. This surreal passing of the buck seems to be standard operating procedure for BT.

Even more appalling than BT's delays and work ethic is their actual customer service. They seem to be trained to apologise profusely (most of the representatives were very nice and extremely apologetic) without doing or saying anything proactive or useful to the customer.

The final straw was when we — in utter frustration — said we wanted to cancel our order after being without Wifi in a new country for a month and counting, with no indication this frustrating cycle would end anytime soon. (I learned from other Trustpilot reviews that this is not an uncommon experience, and could drag on for many months.) The rep curtly said that he would cancel the order. When my husband then asked him if he thought we were receiving acceptable service — the multiple delays, the visit from Openreach in which they told us they had no business servicing our house, the lack of communication from BT about our account, etc — the representative insisted quite strongly that he WAS providing us the service we asked for ... in that he was agreeing to cancel our family's Wifi entire order as we had asked him 45 seconds earlier!

This is customer service at its poorest. The real shame is that I've heard BT broadband is very high quality, but after this experience I would warn any potential BT customers to run away as fast as possible and choose a provider with at least half-decent customer service."
132175,The driver claimed he delivered my food. When I informed the company they said it was delivered and there is no refund. So I am £33.00 out of pocket won’t be using them again.

They told me the phone was ready to collect. When I went to the store it was without staff all day (it's in a Curry's so looked ""open""). How can a store be so under-staffed that it can go a whole day without any staff at all? This is in a populated area (Woking)."

Covid-19 meant we all went into lockdown. I couldn't possibly book an oven clean in 2020 because my elderly parents were advised by the Government to shield. So a few weeks ago I called Team Knowhow and told them the situation and reason why I didn't request an oven clean in 2020. They told me I only had 1 more clean as my insurance was about to expire. I asked if they could extend it for a further 1 year as it was not our fault that Covid took over the world. They told me that it was my fault that I did not book an oven clean and that I should of requested a clean in 2018! Who in their right mind would ask to have their oven cleaned the same year they purchased it!!! Lloyd at Team Knowhow would not put me through to a manager and he was very, very rude. I was so fed up with speaking to him that I just slammed the phone dow. I have since written to Currys... let's see what their response will be. I will never ever buy anything from Currys again and would certainly not purchase the insurance plan. They just want your money and that's it! No customer care whatsoever."

So I rang the customer helpline number, input the repair number... only to be told after a rather long winded blah blah message ""It'll be ready shortly"" what does that mean? Define shortly? Absolute shambles, whilst I acknowledge we're all trying things differently these days - you should at least be able to give me a defined time when the item is going to be repaired - it's called expectation management.

191896,"The Virgin Trap
2 years ago during lockdown we tried to cancel our virgin, we had issues ongoing since the install 2 years prior, after promises and lies, we had enough, we spoke to a chap called Keith, who at the time was working from home (mobile) as most of us were back then, he promised to change our wifi to a more powerful one, and send us out two boosters, for the two main problematic rooms, once the engineer arrived, we soon realized that these promises were Virgin Lies. After months of calls and emails, we started to realize that we were not going to get anywhere, and were told, they don’t give boosters and that we had made this up, and Virgin lied its way out, at this point, we were out of our cooling off, and Virgin Trapped!! scammed...

Fast forward to 4 weeks ago, after what seemed like a lifetime of rubbish internet, we called again to cancel, This time a chap called Bill gave us all the promises, he advised us to take small business internet, and that this would GUARANTEE us cover the whole house and in EVERY ROOM GAURENTEED, it’s a different and MUCH more powerful router, he guaranteed us that we will never call them again with issues (we have this recorded, you can trap us once Virgin, but we won’t be trapped twice) Bill even goes on to say, you even get a £100 back if this isn’t the case…. All recorded Virgin.

So a week or so ago the engineer came, a nice chap called Sam, who installs, says everything is fine, but when we ask him to check with us, he goes into the rooms, and low and behold!!!! the wifi is crap... he tells us, he isn’t sure why but the wifi isn’t working in every room (shock horror) he was shocked to hear, that we were given a guarantee, but not to worry, as all we need is two booster (arh the old booster promise) we explain that we had been promised these before, he told us that he wasn’t sure what had happened in the past, but this time he was writing up an essay for our case, and we would defiantly get these boosters, Guaranteed!!!, We explain we don’t want the wifi as we do not have faith in Virgin and wish to cancel our contract and have it removed, he tells us, he cant do that, but not to panic, we have a 2 week cooling off period, in that time we will have the boosters and all will be fine….. HERE COMES THE VIRGIN TRAP again…

We didn't hear back from them as promised, so we called Virgin, as we don’t want to be in the VIRGIN TRAP again, we call and speak Tass who advises us, that we cannot have boosters (surprise-surprise), we have no Wi-Fi in every room guarantee, no £100 cash back for our inconvenience and worse of all, no cooling off period, we cannot cancel our virgin, we are again in the VIRGIN TRAP, after 84 minutes of being on the phone, being refused a manager call back and being told we cannot make a complaint or cancel, my partner finally got involved in the call and we have now been promised a call back, and advised that they have escalated a compliant, if this happens or not, we will see.

A week later and still no call back from anyone!! We call again, this time we are told that a call was logged, but not complaint has been escalated, or they couldn’t see that one has, they can not guarantee a manager call back, but will let the field agent (the con man who sold us this) and let him know haha. The only thing they could confirm, is that we are now tied into a 2 year business agreement!!! That they will ask that a manager call us back, but they cant guarantee.

So we are now 3 weeks later, no calls from anyone, after requesting this happen 3 times!! NOTHING

Scammed - why inst this kind of conduct illegal??

This isnt the last post on this, I will continue until we have what was promised or it removed.

137439,"I knew Vodafone is one of the worst telecom companies out there but I decided to take the plunge to get a phone I really wanted considering the alternative company offering it was even worse.
What I have experienced so far:
- Expensive ( it gets worse every year as the contract increases ).
-Issues with billing. Their system is adding inflated monthly bills that are simply not there. If you call in their customer service and you inquire about it they will give you the exact figure but the fact remains that their system is showing incorrect charges. Still not rectified.
-Slow internet ( in spite of having Unlimited data )
- Bad coverage
-Charging for roaming. I got an 8-day international pass and although I was reassured that the days would not be counted while I was in the UK I returned home after 4 days and the pass expired after 8. I got a refund from customer service but I wouldn't be surprised if the issue persisted.
- Only 25Gb roaming data for Unlimited.
- Adding random increases to contracts every year according to inflation. This year they added 9% increase which seems excessive.
- Zero tolerance on late payments. They're adding £5 ""late payment fees"" even if the late payment is their fault. Again you would have to call the call centre or live chat to rectify.

In short: I'm counting the days until my contract expires and I can leave this company - and never come back."
188246,"My Stoves cooker had a problem, a constant alarm and 2 of the 5 rings not working. Phoned Stoves for a repair and they suggested setting up 6 month insurance with Domestic and General and told me it would be cheaper than a one off repair and that I would have a date for fixing it texted to me within 48 hours if I did so. I set up the direct debit; there was no contact from them within a week so chased. Several times. Eventually had a text sent to me after 26 days with a date- which was for 49 days after my initial contact. This morning I had a letter through the post telling me 'the attending engineer has advised that my cooker can't be repaired', and they have cancelled my plan. Which is amazing as they haven't been to see it yet, the appointment is for next Friday. This is a completely inept company and I’m looking forward to having my direct debit returned."
130774,"Was receiving poor download speed and BT decided to send out an engineer. I asked whether I should call and cancel the appointment if the problem resolved itself and was told no. Engineer arrived and the problem had resolved itself. BT engineer made a passing comment about a 3rd party extender we use for a games console but as the only device connected to this is a games console and not the two laptops (laptop always uses an Ethernet cable into the modem) it wasn’t an issue. Next month we receive an £85 bill stating that the engineer (not employed by BT but a company named qube) said that the extender was causing the problem. Spoke with BT who will not do anything stating that they can only go of the notes from a 3rd party engineer. Effectively being charged £85 for having a 3rd party booster in the house. Now told the only way to get a refund is to speak with this 3rd party company and have them change the notes? Although we have been given no contact details for them.

Follow up - Someone in the social media team called me and was really helpful, they provided me with a refund and closed the case. If my review was based on this conversation alone it would be 5 stars.

I rang them later again when my wifi continued to drop out. They said they would call back on the landline but didn't.

I asked to speak to a manager but they said there were no managers available, eiother during the day or in the evening. So they appear not to have any Management responsible for customer service advisers. I think that says a lot about this company.

They consistently ask for my landline number, they don't appear to keep any records of previous calls, and they really don't seem to be interested in helping customers resolve their issues.

191500,"Used to be good but customer service is now extremely poor. Dad ordered an Xbox game for my son for Christmas. Upon opening it on Christmas Day, we discovered that the disc inside the box was a completely different game.

I've been buying from Music Magpie since 2017 and they have usually been good. When the occasional slip up has occurred they have fixed it very quickly. However, things appear to have changed for the worse.

First, contacting Music Magpie used to be easy, but they have recently hidden their contact form. Now when you click the Help & Support button next to your order, they send you to a useless FAQ page.

Thankfully, I still had the link to the Contact page from a previous email, so my dad was able to contact them to ask for a replacement, adding that we were happy to send back the box and incorrect disc if required.

First they denied all knowledge of the order, having put no record of it on his profile. Then they delayed a response by asking for the order number, which he had included in the contact form but apparently they couldn't see this for some reason.

After he provided them with the order number via email, their response (a few days later) was this:

""As per our terms and conditions, all missing or faulty items should be reported within 30 days of the estimated delivery date and unfortunately, your request has been made outside of these delivery guidelines.

Due to the length of time that has passed, we do not have access to our records for this order anymore, as such we are unable to help you on this occasion.

We are sorry that we can't be of any further help.

Kind Regards,
Tyson
Customer Services""

Tyson clearly doesn't understand how Christmas presents work. Add to that the postal delays caused by Royal Mail strikes leading up to Christmas and it's clear to see that using their estimated delivery time as the starting point for the returns process is simply absurd. And that they ""do not have access to our records for this order anymore"" is no excuse. Not only have they failed to deliver what was paid for, they have failed to keep a record of it. Both of those things are nobody's fault but theirs, but they won't clear up their own mess. (Incidentally, Music Magpie has records of my orders going all the way back to 2017. How have they lost my dad's order from a month ago?)

The solution to this is simple enough - just send a replacement. They have plenty of this title in stock and this is exactly what they have done in the past. But this is now apparently too much for Music Magpie, who clearly no longer care about the quality of their service (placing the wrong discs in boxes) and choose to stonewall their customers when they (Music Magpie) are at fault.

So after six years and countless transactions, they have now lost me as a customer. I'll be using CEX from now on instead, where the customer experience is consistently much better.

THE NEXT DAY: FROM BAD TO WORSE.

Just hours after Ziggy's response, my dad received a refund... For £1.50, the cheapest item of the four in his order, which was NOT the faulty item.

He made it absolutely clear in his original message which item was at fault. The faulty item was priced £6.39 - more than four times the refund issued - and this is detailed in his order confirmation. But Music Magpie have apparently hoped that they could get away with refunding just £1.50 for the cheapest item in his order and that we either wouldn't notice, or would give up complaining.

""Tyson"" sent my dad another barely comprehensible message stating that we ""can still order from us [Music Magpie] with confidence"". But after this debacle, that's patently nonsense. I've got even less confidence now than I had at this time yesterday, which was near to none at all.

While Music Magpie like to monitor Trustpilot and make out here that they're friendly and efficient, they also make it as exasperating as possible to fix problems without taking the time to come here and giving them a public dressing down. It should not be this hard.

Could Music Magpie have done a worse job of managing what should have been a very small issue with a very simple fix? It's hard to think that they could get it wrong from here, but we'll see.

Looking forward to Ziggy's response to this update.

OMG. THEY MADE IT WORSE.

More hoops to jump through! Yesterday they were happy to issue a refund. Today they want me to get my dad to email them to authorise them to deal with me. Like he'll get a reply.

Ziggy, here's how to do your job:

1. Find the order in YOUR records. My dad gave you the order number twice and I gave you it here to verify that this is a genuine purchase.
2. Find the game in the order that is at fault. This is the one that my dad specified in his original complaint to you. I know this because I worded that complaint.
3. Refund the value of that game to my dad.
4. Say sorry.

Is that too hard?"
154405,"Absolutely the worse company. Been a customer for 23 years. Rang them to say that I was thinking of leaving it as my bill had gone up quite a lot. Went quite some time talking to Sam one abroad who offered me a reduction of £30 on my monthly charge. I said I would think about it and call them back an hour later I called back to confirm but the new person couldn’t get anywhere near that discount. So I decided to cancel. Then I spoke to another advisor who said that I couldn’t have a reduction. After spending hours on the phone I left it called back the following day andHad to repeat the whole process again. Still not the reduction I was offered even though they had notes on the conversation confirming the price. After hours spent again I ask to speak with the manager I was so frustrated. She apologised and said the manager would call me within the hour nobody called. called again today going through the whole process again I was told I would need to upgrade my equipment. Really angry now I insisted on speaking with a manager but as usual the managers were busy and couldn’t speak with me. I was assured that they were very sorry and that someone would call me back by the end of the day. No calls received. I have now cancelled all of my services the phone and TV.

115978,"I won’t be ordering online from them again, the used laptop I purchased from their website arrived unchecked as someone else’s details were still on it and locked by their pin, 2 emails later and still not able to access it I took it back to my local branch for a refund. As the very nice staff were checking it they managed to unlock it and I kept it as no time to go looking for a replacement so fingers crossed I don’t have any further problems and inconvenience with it."

139456,Great price and quick delivery thanks
134706,Very simple to use and was offered a fair price for my ipad. Only grumble was paying for my own packaging to protect the device.
177311,"My wife's phone just died one day. So i had the phone insured with carphone warehouse, £10 month. I went in store to make a claim/get a new phone. My wife is point of contact for her 2 elderly parents so cant be without a phone for to long. The staff didnt care, its procedure to send the phone away and because we live in Northern Ireland its a 2 day delivery for your replacement phone. Which after 2 visits to the shop and 3 phones calls i found out was SECOND HAND. The money i've spent on the insurance and the excess i could have bought a new phone. After making my claim i got an email to say the phone was delayed for another day. I made a complaint with the insurance company, who said they would compensate me with £50. Guess what 3 weeks later and ''NO'' compensation....... Cheers Gary job well done.


Thanks Jim for your reply, but its your in house insurance TEAM KNOWHOW i was dealing with. You can stick whatever label you want on it (RETURN, NOT USED) but someone else had the phone before my wife and in my eyes thats SECOND HAND. This looks like the standard say SORRY to fob people off and DO NOTHING TO HELP. Very POOR customer service."
191808,Perfect product arrived in time. Easy to find and order. Fantastic
141203,Very fast delivery...some accessories not included but this is expected for most used item and weren't mentioned in the advert so all was fine. Will buy again.
113185,"Shocking company continually misleads and lies. Once again problems with Billing where BT blatantly overcharge . Contracts mean nothing to this company nor does customer service , they seem to think they have the right to do what they want . Staff are clueless even they can't follow the confusing , cumbersome methods that BT use , so you have no hope of getting anything sorted .
I just hope they don't respond to this with that meaningless useless message asking to contact them via Facebook or Twitter."

154881,"Friday 21st October at midday whilst on…

Ok, so I left a review yesterday because our internet and house phone have been down since 21st October.and Robbie responded suggesting we reach out on Facebook & Twitter .... we did, result I thought. But this evening a new issue:
I cannot believe what has just happened TODAY 27TH OCT. I haven't been able to speak to my Son because of the phone line, but sent him a text to see if he was available for me to call him from our home line (callers can't get through). Well I have just spoken to him and he told me the number calling him was a completely different number to the number we've had for the past 40+ years. Is this why we have no Internet, the account has been moved - the BT Chat line couldn't find anything for our umber either but I didn't think it could have been because the line had changed ....... A lady, 2 houses away moved out on Friday 21st, the same date as our internet went down - it sounds very much like BT closed our connection instead of hers. I'm certain BT won't own up to this, but BT have made our lives an absolute misery since Friday 21st. Three people unable to work from home, setting up camp in Costa or not working, losing money daily. Please treat this as urgent BECAUSE IT IS - Please contact us this evening, we want our line reinstated
Date of experience: 26 October 2022
THIS NOW EXTREMELY URGENT"

Sent a fully working PS4 in a fantastic condition!! I received an email back from them stating the item was faulty and the offer had been significantly reduced. I contacted music magpie as I was confused as the PlayStation left me in a fully working order even provided photographic evidence of the console on the night before sending. Their response was it’s come to us not working. Don’t be fooled by the fully insured delivery it’s a con.

Don’t sell any items here as they are con artists. Customer service is not their forte either."

And I've still not had my money back and I've called up numerous times and I get the same thing said ""we've already paid you"" which you haven't because I have bank statements proving that's a lie, when I inform you of that then I have ""it's with the banking team"" which I'm sorry it's unacceptable to be passing the blame because while I'm on the phone to you it should be dealt with there and then not have me waiting since 22nd August for my money. You are steal as far as I'm concerned. I would not recommend carphone warehouse to anyone due to the customer services in both the stores and over the phone."

You took so long to answer a simple order enquiry that I nearly ordered again from another company. When the product did eventually arrive it was left outside in the rain. Nobody even knocked, I think it was there all night. Just hope it still works when it’s opened at Xmas."
181645,"nasty, nasty company; be careful everyone what contract you sign and remember that if you sell your property they will f you for the remainder of the contract; as the agent said, they don't take into account personal circumstances 🤣"

Samsung support told me the max memory I could fit and I was not happy with their feedback so I thought that I would ask Mr Memory.

141792,"I ordered a new double oven to be delivered and installed on Dec 23rd. On the day of delivery, I got a message saying that “we are on our way with your order” with an exact time of delivery. An hour later, a new message came: “due to driver sickness, you delivery has been rescheduled for… Jan 5th”. Really? No oven, obviously no Christmas dinner. :-(. I tried to speak with someone at Marks’ on the phone for an hour to no avail. I had to resort to the online chat where I discussed with Louisa Iliffe, not to name her. A bot would have done a better job and her manager was no better. No understanding and no flexibility whatsoever to re-arrange the installation. No compensation either. “All slots with the installer are busy until Jan 5th”. So it sounds like Marks have only one installer. Haha. Marks: you have ruined our Christmas and your customer service is an absolute disgrace."

187769,"On 15th December 2022 I ordered the following from currys

Apple 10.2"" ipad (2021) - 64GB space grey

I paid the full amount of £350.00 with a voucher and £19.00 with cash.

This order was place via the click and collect service provided on the 15th December 2022.
I was expecting to take delivery of the item on 17th December 2022, but at present I have still not received the goods.

Please see below the process I have taken so far in regard to this purchase.

I rang on the 20th December to chase this order to be told there had been a delay with my order and this would be rectified within 48 hours, to only ring again on the 23rd December to be told exactly the same.

I then went into Truro store on the 24th December to ask if they could update me on this to be told by a member of staff this item had been lost in transit in which no one informed me of before.

I later that day rang the customer service team to explain that I had been told the item had been lost in transit to then be told that DPD received the item on the 16th December then had misplaced the item, found it again and returned it to the depot on the 23rd December.

After this I called again on the 29th December to ask to speak to a manager in which I got told I would need to book an appointment, so I did for the 31st December.
A manager Claudia then called me on the 30th December to offer me a refund or to re order, in which I stated I would like to re order. Instead of click and collect as now this Christmas present was late and I don’t think I should be running around for this item when it wasn’t delivered at the expected time I asked Claudia to have it delivered to my home address. Claudia then said she would re order this and once I receive a tracking number to call back on 03445611234 to give the tracking number so a home delivery could be arranged.

The next call was on the 13th January to explain I have not received any tracking number and I asked for a manager (Claudia if possible) could call me as by this point I was absolutely disgusted by the customer service I had received. I was told that a manager would call me on the 14th January.

14th January no call received

I rang again on my lunch break at work on the 16th January to be told that on the 23rd when the item had been returned by DPD that Currys did not scan the item back in to confirm the return in which another Ipad was never re ordered and that is why I never received a tracking number. I asked for a manager to call me as I had no call on the 14th as arranged so arranged for another call on the 17th January and yet again no one rang me.

Curry’s have now had my money since the 15th December paid in full and to this date 19/01/23 still I have no item.

To have had to chase this many times is totally unacceptable and is poor customer service in my opinion. Not one person has contacted me directly in regards to my purchase it has always been myself chasing.

Curry’s has failed to deliver within a reasonable time and after the agreed deadline is a breach of the Consumer Rights 2015"
166182,"Terrible and disappointing. I added the app for the first time ever to watch my football team play their final game f the season.
I paid and tried to watch the game, the streaming was terrible, STOP, then START then STOP.......
Not good and unbearable and for me very disappointing.
So I canceled my subscription with continuing question saying if I was sure I want to leave!.
Worst thing of all was NOW TV are continuing to charge us."
113686,"Excellent service, quick and kept us informed about delivery. unfortunately the part wasn't quite long enough but no problem in sending the part back, Once they received the part we had a refund. Would certainly recommend the company to any family & friends."
120420,Once again the Glasgow shop goes above and beyond with their help and knowledge. Salesman Peter spent a lot of time with me on helping choose the right upgrade for my system and took his time explaining the best way to achieve what I was looking for. Definitely a guys toy shop!!
105793,Fantastic service and price. Ordered a battery at 3 30pm and it arrived at 11am the next day.
139839,"I ordered an item for collection at my local Sainsburys through Argos’ website. I did this out of convenience and decided to pay slightly more for item, than it was available for elsewhere. I did as the website informed me that it would be ready for collection the following morning. When I turned up at lunchtime to collect the item, it hadn’t been delivered. The store agent let me know the item was available from another store, but couldn’t transfer my payment nor have the item relocated for collection the following day. So instead he had to reserve the item and refund my purchase. I had to then make a 20minutes drive to buy the item again, reserved at another store. Rather inconvenient, and ultimately creating the problem I was trying to resolve."
175591,Great service and great value would use again and would recommend as worth looking at as an option if you are stuck for money in the current problems
155118,Delivery could be tracked and was on time packaging taken away all good
142970,"Excellent service, memory arrived before 1pm next day and laptop was back up and running."
174976,Very friendly efficient service. Nothing too much trouble.
145006,"Never really worked, even with extenders and sitting next to the box. Often called for someone to help and they send engineers out who say its fine coming into the house so must be an issue getting it round the house. Doesn't make sense considering it doesn't work even when next to the box. Only option given to help was to buy another wifi hub for over £100. Paid £53 a month for way too long for nothing to ever work. I use my mobile data so completely useless even having it. Moved to Virgin for £25 a month and now we don't even use extenders. AVOID BT AT ALL COSTS."
170075,Excellent fast service and well packaged. Model look up was a big help
100513,"Worst company I’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with. Order a cooker hood in silver. Was sent a cooker hood with black chimney, was then told I should have checked contents and was told if the box was opened I can’t return. I’ve now had to buy a silver chimney hood from elsewhere to make it look like what I was supposed to get

The images on the marks electrical page for the cooker hood is clearly showing a silver hood. I’ve sent images to show this along with a link to the page. I’ve asked for a refund for the additional parts I’ve had to buy to make this right as they wouldn’t refund me. I’ve currently had to wait on hold for 40 mins plus every time I’ve called which has been 5-6 times now. Spoke to multiple customer service advisors pretending to be a manager. Have waiting on 3 separate occasions for a manager call back which never happens. An absolute joke to be honest. Still not resolved. My advice would be, but somewhere else if you want what you’ve ordered"

What a shambles of a company covid -19 or not .have emailed them 36 hours ago guess what nothing back. I only wanted to change my banking direct debit details so they just will not get paid as my account is now closed best move I have made I think ,BYE BYE team useless."

121818,"I ordered a part for my broken cooker on 2 October 2022 from ESPARES.

I was told it would be up to two weeks to get the part.

Two weeks later, the part didn't arrive. I queried this with ESPARES and I was told it would be another two weeks. I queried this as it seemed like an automated response, but was told, 'This is not an automated response, the date has been provided to us by the manufacturer but we do advise it is subject to change and the ETA can be pushed back depending on the Availability of the part. Once the part is in stock we will notify you.'

Two weeks went past, still no part. I then queried with Zanussi, the original cooker maker, whether the part was still made, it wasn't.

ESPARES sent me an email saying that the part was unavailable, and unknown when it would be returned. And I could get a refund by contacting the customer service team.

The email i had received was from their customer services email address. So I sent an email to this address saying to provide me a refund. I was returned a copy of the email they had just sent me about the part not being available and to ask for a refund from customer service.

I then replied again asking for a refund and was again sent the exact same email. I replied to the email a third time to get the refund. And I still got sent the same email. It was obvious at this point that they were blowing past my request for a refund and trying to fob me off.

I went to the website where it say there are numerous ways to get a refund by going to my order and clicking a certain button, (cancel, return.)
I went to my order and none of the buttons were available!

I looked for a contact number, but they don't appear to have a contact number either.

It is very obvious that ESPARES are not offering a 'hassle free refund service' but are in fact making as hard as they can to get a refund from them.

I am putting in a last email and going another way to try and get a refund. If this is not successful, then the next stop is trading standards and the local council.

EDIT 21/11/2022: I have now been sent an email stating that my refund has now been provided."

I was struggling to get wifi in the room above my router when using the standard virgin super hub 3, but now i can get it at the bottom of my garden no problems.

A few months ago my wife and daughter were pulling out of a retail store car park when a Deliveroo rider rode straight across the front of the his bike hit the front wing he was riding on the pedestrian walkway opposite to the flow of traffic and came from behind a bush which was obscuring the view He then stood up and gave the most foul abuse to my wife and daughter and kicked the rear wing causing a dent and smashed her wing mirror off the car. I reported this to the Police but they said local cameras were insufficient to provide any help.
I reported this to Deliveroo but suprise suprise they cant identify any rider that was in the area at the time I have sent many emails with descriptions and pictures and exact locations as requested but they keep asking for order number and restaurant involved but this was not involved They are obviously ignoring the situation hoping it will go away.MY WARNING TO YOU IS IF YOU USE DELIVEROO IN ROMFORD YOU MAY COME UP AGAINST THE SAME PSYCO THAT WE DID AND IF YOU COMPLAIN TO HIM ABOUT YOUR ORDER LATE ETC WHAT WILL HE DO!!!!!!!!!
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT DELIVEROO WILL DO NOTHING
PLEASE SHARE THIS TO WARN OTHERS"
180940,I contacted the company through the chat option. Although I had to wait a while I eventually spoke to a very helpful advisor Dino H. My direct debit had been increased recently and was due to be increased again next month. I checked my account to find I was in credit by a sizable amount. Dino H has set me up on a variable direct debit so I only pay for my usage and has ordered a refund of the credit to my bank account. Very satisfied will the outcome of my enquiry.

102902,"I have been a customer for a while and have many orders, but I apparently missed this last order (first time) and the support was abysmal. The responses were just copy-and-paste answers saying that the rider tried contacting me (they didn't) and they refused to do anything. I had my phone next to me the whole time which other riders have used to call me in the past and it showed no messages or received calls. Reading the other reviews here it looks like the other delivery companies are no better. Looks like it's back to directly ordering from places or collecting in person which is cheaper anyway. I will try and get a chargeback for this order and the next thing to do is to sell the worthless shares I bought at their IPO because I believed in the company, but treating your customers like this is not sustainable."

But as the time slot is 2 hours long I decided to just wait for them to knock. They sat there for around 15 mins and then drove off and said that they tried to deliver but no answer. To top it off after calling Argos they tell me the drivers are over 40 mins away so can’t come back, which couldn’t be correct due to the time frame. And then I’m told that I have to wait a whole week for another delivery slot!!!!! Disgraceful!"

I dont have my pre ordered phone! I had no email, no letter, no phone call, no text, no nothing from them.

I had to call up myself to see what was going on and all I got was an outsourced call to someone who barely spoke English and didn't take me seriously. She couldn't seem to understand how not having my pre ordered phone was an issue and that I should simply cancel my phone and order a different one? What sort of customer service is that??

I'm honestly so shocked with my experience. I now have no phone seeing as I sold my previous contract expecting to have my new one already

Seeing as they won't take my complaint seriously or see what the problem is I'm going to the ombudsman to see what he thinks about it.

Thought a new phone for Christmas would be nice, now I have to deal with all this instead of enjoying time with my family."

177892,Great quality for a cheap price. Also quick delivery. Often can get things you can’t buy anywhere else. Plenty of choice too.
143344,"Good afternoon, this is a genuine review of our experience with appliances direct. To summarise very easy to place the order constant emails, updating us of when the product was to arrive. Received an email one day early prompt delivery goods received in full working order. will definitely use again Faultless.

Kind regards.

198946,"Dont sell what you dont have. And then deliver when you say you will, not two days to the side of it, to a different address"
111416,Item was by far the best price and service was excellent with email notification of shipment with tracking number and delivered on time will buy from here again.
149219,"Very similar experience to Giles Cover - see earlier review of today's date. Sent them an iPhone 8 in excellent condition with no marks or scratches having been kept from new in fully enclosed case and with one careful owner - my wife. They claim over 3 scratches on display - there were absolutely none, and marks on body - again there were none. They reduced the ""guaranteed"" £80 price to £25!! Like Giles I've rejected and asked for phone to be returned, stating I will hold them personally responsible if it comes back with marks and scratches. It was sent to them very carefully wrapped in considerable bubble wrap and in a new, sturdy box. Don't use this company."
127390,Great company. Really good service
112952,My experience with overall was wondering Jasmin Z went through everything with me and took his time to help me through my enquiry.
140648,"Prompt delivery, films as usual, have long shelf life"
185798,"Quick, efficient, exactly what I ordered!"
136965,Takes to long to get what you want and no it did not say what you are saying it said delivery next day will not order from you again or my freinds
132821,Excellent Service. Washing Machine order placed on Monday 2pm; delivery by 2pm Tuesday. Delivery time advised by text - delivery team very helpful; item delivered to requested site.
113264,Quick efficient service. Easy to use website enabled me to get the correct part I needed.
192376,I love using the GTech it’s light & v efficient . I recently broke the connecting tube . I had a v speedy response with a new one arriving within 2 days free of charge .
180087,Very quick response to query and very good advice
163472,Applied for a phone contract on 16th December and FINALLY got the confirmation of getting the phone on 13th January! Very long wait to hear back but I got the phone next day delivery
156032,"The Technical support person who I spoke with was knowledgeable, helpful, and customer focused"
173998,"Since the end of November and first engineer visit I’ve been managing without working fridge freezer.
Daily grocery shopping and keeping food outdoors.
Three engineer visits later, appliance has been written off. More phone calls to D&G and Whirlpool as D&G were saying they didn’t receive a report (they did).
Finally confirmation that I will be receiving an e-voucher within 2 days! One week later I’m still waiting and just been told to ring again the day after tomorrow.
How is a family suppose to manage for a month without a working fridge? Especially during Christmas?
I have a cover for another appliance with D&G and looks like I will be moving it elsewhere."
184414,"Fast excellent service. Condition was ""good"" however it looked like a new phone! Will definitely recommend and use again in future."
198188,"I ordered a fibre broadband package from them after they confirmed it was available at my address. I was given a connection date within a week. That was two months ago. They keep telling me that they need to organise an engineer to visit, but the expected date of the visit has just moved back one day every day for the last two months. I can't even cancel the order as you have to do it over the phone and I haven't been able to set aside the one plus hours you need to wait to speak to an advisor. Hopeless."
160626,"i had a serious charge of £4.80 for a local call of 1min 19sec.i was not aware that there were time restrictions in place.
as a goodwill gesture the
company cancelled the item. i am now a happy customer and this shows the company is on the ball."
123828,"Great service and got the part in good time, thanks"
136641,reserved goods kept!helpful friendly and well informed
127585,"*update
despite Mazuma's excuse of a reply, the same iPad was sent to another company who passed it as perfect and paid me the fair amount.

I sent a perfectly good working order iPad Pro with an undamaged screen and then received an email telling me the device needed a new screen and the price had been slashed from £130 to £35! Did I still wish to accept? Certainly not.

What a waste of my time, sounds like a scam to me, beware."
178875,"I am an OAP and longtime 3 customer. I went into local 3 shop yesterday to renew phone and router contracts and was conned into getting a £20 tablet instead of a Samsung one, with an extra 2 year contract by the sales girl. They refuse to answer phone now and sent an email saying that devices cannot be returned."
199472,"Friendly, knowledgeable, staff and prompt delivery of my purchases. Thank you :)"
125616,"Staff in the shop useless
Can't purchase new Samsung tab s8
Done at home easily"
163520,"Is it because BT is a big company they think they can treat you appallingly, I spoke to one of their customer services team to ask for help with my bill, due to the financial situation we are all going through I am struggling, l asked if there was any way my monthly bill could be reduced he replied NO but we can offer you a faster speed for more money, so if that’s how they look after the OAP I will be glad when my contract finishes I wii definitely not renew nor will any of my family. Just an other big company that does not give 2 hoots once you have signed on the dotted line."
195872,The mugs were delivered in only a few days in spite of the strikes and Christmas post
193143,"Really happy with the item and it performs better than expected, it was delivered earlier than expected.
However when ordering the member of staff when asked if all the cables required were in the box said yes , but there was no HDMI cable , had i been told that one was needed i would have ordered one and saved the pain of running around late in the afternoon, but never mind the main thing was a good product and a very good prompt service with great phone service
Thanks John Gallagher"
148067,"I have been Vodafone customer for over 20 years and recently noticed that Vodafone have over changed me on my monthly sim only contact without informing and when contacted customer service I was told that Vodafone is allowed to increase the charges at middle of fixed contract, and I cannot end my fixed contract at midd terms so it is designed to rip off the customers"
107005,"Still waiting on delivery, looks like it’s stuck in the couriers"
187224,Very weak selection of 'entertainment'. Nowtv are dinosaurs extracting money from poor people offering free trials and hoping they forget to cancel. There is no appeal to the catalogue of entertainment so you forget all about them and end up paying 2 months for no viewing. Netflix Amazon prime far superior.
196840,"Ordered 4 games from CeX. Got tracking on the package and it arrived quickly to find 3 games but no worry, I know orders with multiple items can be dispatched separately. Last one arrives a few days later without getting any notification about its dispatch or any tracking. Overall a good experience, it COULD just be a bit better"
197090,"Read the other reviews to get the general idea. Very poor WIFI consistantly cuts out, appalling customer service. I strongly advise anyone. Do not suscribe to this unprofessional and terrible WIFI service."
111159,"terrible customer service on chat

got transferred 4 times just to get information about my contract order - took an hour!! Incompetent people"
162248,"There was a major problem and my order made in November had not been issued. Even after contact in early December, it was still unresolved. However, staff in Customer Services went ‘above and beyond’ to ensure I received my dvd’s in time for Christmas despite a postal strike. Well done guys!!!"
190078,"Account blocked, no real explanation after several attempts requested. The original reason given was incorrect and prompted me to place another order. This in turn used up my paypal credit limit due to pending payments and stopped my buying from Scan.co.uk. All very annoying. There seems to be a rogue accounts department that can't or won't comunicate."
156268,We have broadband and telephone through NOW TV. It is dire. Generally the broadband drops out throughout the day. Most calls have an unstable internet message coming up. When there is a general problem there is no contact. Regardless of cost would not use them ever again.
196452,"Great item, arrived on time. Thank you"
104696,"Easy to deal with, fast reliable service."
167630,I had paid £3 for packaging of our new washing machine to be taken and it wasn't. My wife was at home when the delivery arrived and she wasn't aware. However the drivers should have been aware as it should have been on the delivery note. Otherwise I'm happy with my new washer and also with the comms from Hughes.
133100,Got my offer. Sent my phone and was paid the agreed amount in 2 days. Very pleased.
138792,I’ve used this service a few times now and find it very reliable and easy to use and you get exactly what you ask for 10/10
177408,"Ordered replacement vac motor on-line. Arrived in double quick time, great price. Couldn't ask for better and will certainly use Parts Centre again when I need similar items."
168800,"Excellent communication ! Replay to my email quickly.
Will strongly recommend.Very happy with my iPhone XR. Stay in business.Wishing you best success."
142721,"Ordered one day, delivered the next. Kept me informed when my purchase was expected to arrive. All in all very efficient."
138097,My childrens happy with this fast ntework
129882,Pretty nice app. Opens doors for opportunity
148663,"Pros: Good choice of products. Clear instructions on how to use the site and purchase items.
Cons: Delivery was slower than expected. Not enough description of the wear on the used product."
120237,"Ordered my new PC just before christmas. The PC specialist website is brilliant, easy to use and has a great range of hardware to choose from. Also, it lets you know if something you have chosen may be overkill and saving you money, like the power supply, which I thought was a nice touch.

From order to deliver, it took just over 17 days for my system to be delivered! Amazing! What makes this more impressive is this was over the christmas period.

The PC they built for me is an absolute beast! It looks amazing and runs perfectly. Hard to find a game it drops below a solid 60fps on ultra settings.

Overall, what more can I say. Excellent website, great build time and what they deliverd was beyond my expectations. Couldn't recommend highly enough!

Thanks to all the guys that worked on my system at PC Specialist."
165848,The staff are very welcome to the costumers
136339,Bought a tv after 2 day broke took it back to store took over 3 hours to resolve issue was treated bad offered no compensation at all.was made to feel like a liar while they unpacked tv to set up and test only to find out I was telling the truth was offered no apologies .it was Thursday the 13th of June I thought it was Friday the 13th that was supposed to be a bad day .But seems any day at Currys pc world can be
192980,Sorry but skirt was returned as was not what I had expected.it was too fussy and more for a younger person on a special occasion.
181960,"Quality products, good prices and very quick deliver by top courier."
142370,"Really easy to use! Purchased 2 calendars as gifts, recipients very happy with them!
Would highly recommend this company."
157732,"On hold for over 2 hours, and then the phone just disconnects. I was calling to renew my contract, am now going to disconnect.

Just awful."
126298,"Used to pay extra because customer service made it worth it. Deteriorated to a black hole of "" you could do this online"" , never thought of that.... and typically none functional chat bots that are worse than a search engine that send you on circular, or 404 ending journeys.

..but hey you've reduced call volumes right? Must be because there are less problems...."
184399,"Very easy website to use, and very clear instructions"
182149,"Assistance was very helpful, knowledgeable and went out of their way to present the mass of good equipment within the store. Curry’s have had and continues to have great viewing of electrical for customer requirements. Curry’s presents a range of name brand equipment."
107121,"ridiculous and company, I ordered a washing machine for them to take two payments out, contacted them and they told me they could see two payments but nothing could be done for 24hours. I also paid for next day delivery to be told from the delivery company it would not be next day delivery as it would take two days from order. Husband took time off work for it to be delivered today to then be told very didn’t deliver in time for the load to go out and now I won’t receive it to nearly a week after the order. Can’t find anywhere on an email to make a an official complaint and no one is helpful on the phone. I will not be using very again. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
108867,"Quality of the prints were good but I had paid nearly £7 for next day delivery and it arrived 4 days later, when questioned all they replied was saying it’s busy this time of year, so a bit disappointing, so if you’re after quick delivery I’d probably advise to go elsewhere."
119341,just one word says it excellent delivery perfect after installation thanks just one point I am an engineer so knew what I wanted and how to install it
107998,"Ordered a phone last week and told it would be delivered today 12/12/22 by Yodel,waited in all day for nothing,not even a phone call"
181021,"Great support, not that it was needed. Checked to see if I was happy with my purchase and all was well. Would definitely buy from these guys again."
100102,"Best app ever love it highly recommended
Never ever had any issues"
186837,"Apart from a good price, the service was excellent, and we were kept informed of delivery - which was to the minute 👍🏻"
124093,"Installed smart meters, they don't work. Logged complaint more than 8 weeks ago, still not resolved. You ask them to call you back, they never do. They reject my manual readings and now have billed me £1990.97. What a bunch of clowns. Not looking forward to spending a day trying to resolve this mess"
192819,"I've been waiting for over an hour on the phone, and this has been the second time I've been waiting. The first time I tried, I managed to get through, but the customer service assistant didn't sound happy so she put me on hold without any explanation and had to wait for another hour before I got through the second time, and when I got through, I was then told, that I was passed on to the wrong department and was put on hold once again, so after another hour had passed, I just hung up. Now they've hung up on me, Team knowhow, you certainly don't 'knowhow' to treat customers in their times of need, you're a joke."
129491,"Wish I had read the reviews on this site before taking my laptop into Currys to be repaired by their ""Know How"" team. They have had the item for three weeks now and still can't give me an update as to when it is likely to be repaired. And if you try and call the Know How phone number you will just be left in a queue for 1 hour plus! I also think it's very poor of Currys to keep trying to pedal the ""COVID excuse"" to try to excuse what seem to be some very long standing issues with their ""Know How"" offering. A lot of these complaints seem to predate COVID. And in any event COVID or no COVID it doesn't stop you having the basic courtesy to just let a customer, who has been waiting for three weeks, know where their item - which they need for work is - and when they are likely to get it back. That's a two minute e-mail / text message. Nor does it stop you hiring sufficient staff to deal promptly with the volume of calls which you are receiving. 1 hour plus is not an acceptable wait time!! And if you know people are having to wait that long then obviously you need to hire more staff! I've dealt with other companies over the last few months and none of them are giving such poor customer service. So no before any Currys person responds to blame COVID I don't think it's the pandemic's fault. I think - as the below reviews show - you have a massive issue with your ""Know How"" service. It is not up to standard and needs vast and immediate improvement. Am personally now just trying to get my laptop back as soon as I can. Wouldn't trust them to fix it properly and would rather just take it to a local independent shop which is what I should have done in the first place! : (("
145881,The correct part was delivered in the specified time. Easy to navigate around the website. Really happy as I have now have a fully functional washing machine.
146668,"Pre-ordered new release vinyl arrived on date of release and was delivered in excellent packaging allowing no damage to occur. Vinyl plays excellently as well, so thank you HMV again for brilliant service. Recommended Seller, A++"
112808,"It was really almost an impulse buy, when we began considering a replacement TV. Pat spent a lot of time explaining the technology advances that had been made since we bought out last TV. I went home to consider, and bought it the next day. We are very happy with the product, and how it meets the way we watch TV today."
101043,Got the parts fast cheap prices excellent service from a good company
142476,"If its in stock and ready to dispatch, fantastic.
If its out of stock, you find out till after you have paid.. then you are given a 'probably' eta, which do not always occur. there needs to be some kind of mechanism to let you know when eta is before check out... and if that has changed an update. constantly having to call in is a real pain!!!"
104273,Alun Sv was very helpful and resolved my request
197611,Repeatedly had to be chased multiple times to process refund of cancelled order. Shop cannot fully access/change any online orders. All in all it seems like a very unprofessional company and I would avoid if possible
191024,What a joke Vodafone are cancelled a mobile tablet but still charging me 3 months later cant talk to them only live chat pathetic only to be told ive not cancelled it and there is no record of me calling them I will never deal with Vodafone again total joke
116790,"I'm a longtime Izotope user, but their loyalty sales aren't always attractive. I've had Stutter Edit for a several years, and I never upgraded to SE2 because Izotope offered it for $99. I haven't been a customer P.I. Boutique, but your sale popped up on FaceBook for $10.03. Make me an offer I cannot refuse! The transaction was smooth, I am familiar with Izotope's portal as a customer and I had no problems. It's already in my latest work. Let me know when you blow out Diva!"
167913,"Very pleased with service received at your Carmarthen store, professional and helpful very knowledgeble staff."
103966,"The app is so easy to order and as soon as you push buy you are informed of progress . Next day it turns up , really good way to shop"
155770,Really quick delivery and good value.
151495,Utterly disgusted cancelling my order on me this close to Christmas. My autistic 6 year old is desperate for his festive bedsheets and there's loads of presents in my order plus wrapping paper. I've waited weeks and weeks and you just cancel my order.
191868,Good delivery notification via text. The 2 guys were very helpful. Dishwasher not damaged in transit.
184926,Always great service even with the postal strike
137781,Just started using this app and so far I really like it and easy to navigate.
155245,"Tried taking over 4 lift emergency phone lines with BT. Seemed straight forward. Now being chased for overdue bills for at least 9 different numbers I can work out so far.
Complaints team were no help and have not resolved the issue.
Never come across such useless customer service and so much switching between departments as know one can tell me what numbers are active and why they are charging for so many lines."
189742,Much better second time round! CeX sent the wrong phone for my first order but they fully refunded this one and got it right on the re-order. Item arrived on time and I was kept fully informed.
184611,"Over priced tbh, they want £480 for an iphone 8..not even a plus, almost £500 for a 64gb iphone 8? can get newer ones for not even £100 more...

also got to love the ""trade in feature"" does anyone actually use this...cant you see what a con it is? they offered me £35 for my iphone SE thats pristine apart from 1 small scratch on back of the phone..when they're reselling like iphone 6 for £330! and you can buy a used SE for £200 + still...so they want to knock £35 off which makes it £445 for the iphone 8 instead of £480 and they get my SE which they'll resell for minimum £200? do they think we're dumb or something? anyone who uses this trade in service clearly is."
166006,"Very well informed about delivery date and time, delivery men very helpful"
119314,"Extremely impressed by the service given when my mobile phone developed a fault.
The staff could not have been more helpful."
185178,"I've been using PC Specialist since 2006 and have always found them excellent. My latest order (I think my seventh with them) was for a gaming computer. I have more or less stopped bothering to compare their prices against buying components separately; the price difference is usually tiny (sometimes it even saves money) and it's nice not to have to build it yourself and have to worry about electrocuting the CPU or buying a mismatched component. The initial queue took a while (24 days in ""pre-production"" i.e. waiting to be built), which probably reflected a surge in demand once graphics cards became more available again around Aug 2021, but building, testing, and delivery were quick after that. The machine was pre-overclocked and neatly built, and has worked perfectly so far. Good work."
134708,Love this site. always hooking it up with plugins and deals.
137953,Website is very easy to use and computer received on time and exactly as expected. Very pleased with the service and will happily use again in the future.
183892,"I would give a zero if it was possible. Ordered a phone for next day delivery. Two weeks later and still no phone, only a SIM card was delivered. Endless calls trying to sort it out and still no resolution. The DD for the phone has also been taken. Dreadful service and useless assistance to resolve the matter provided."
196088,"Good service. PC took a while to be delivered but with the current difficulties everyone is having getting their hands on hardware that's hardly surprising and not something I can fault PCS for.

PC came well packed with easy information and accessories needed to get set up. Only reason its not 5 stars is because the IO shield didn't align with the motherboard correctly so some ports were not usable and the front case IO doesn't appear to have been connected as those ports also do not work."
130212,The staff (Harris)at Crown Point Leeds we’re very helpful. The installation guys (Marcus) was very careful removing and installing our new American fridge freezer. Great all round experience.
182042,Very well advised by the agent. Nothing to say.
103666,"The site was easy to navigate, the filters were useful and it was relatively easy to choose my new phone."
146996,The engineer was very good and said that my dishwasher wanted a new motor which he would order and then it would be fitted when they had received it . However later that day I received a message saying my dishwasher had been repaired and thanking me for using them . My dishwasher had NOT yet been repaired and I am waiting for an engineer to finish repairing it . Your comments please . MRS BERYL VERNUM .
199510,"Sanela A understood immediately the problem with me not being able to increase my Direct debit amount out and made the change for me. It was all sorted very efficiently

It was big relief as I had been worried that I would build up a big debit if I couldn’t get it changed"
101396,"Worst customer experience ever. Absolute joke of a company. Order food, costing a fair whack, waited not over an hour but was forgiving as was new years eve. The driver arrived and opened the bag and I knew it wasn't ours. He went to the car and retrieved another bag and again, not ours. He said he must have mixed it up with another order. He leaves and I contact deliveroo who want evidence, in photo form, I have the wrong order. Well obviously I didn't take a photo as the driver took the wrong food back. What I did have was the name and the order number of the wrong food and the restaurant having contacted deliveroo restaurant support to confirm this had happened. Still no refund. Fortunately the restaurant, a chain, who said they hate deliveroo with a passion, resolves the issue while deliveroo just simply refused any refund or discussion on the matter. From now on its just eat or Uber for us."
199071,Fast and efficient ordering and delivery of a great quality product. I had an issue which wasn’t their fault but they were excellent at sorting it for me. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy from them again. Definitely worthy of a 5 star review.
112473,Fast delivery & efficient service. Good prices are a nice bonus too
195205,"Wait for my tumble dryer on Thursday
15:00 between 19:00pm
It turn up 8:45pm I was not happy because I had to go to work"
161992,Reliable broadband service over the last 12 months. Not perfect as Virgin Media has a tendency to make configuration updates (causing the line to drop for several minutes at a time) during working hours :-(
162714,"Very good from purchase to delivery, staff in store excellent and took the time to demonstrate product."
131213,"helpful telesales, got the earbuds within days. All seamless, friendly and easy."
178403,Superb The first set of photographs went missing. However they quickly sent another set.
134243,"Only paying a month to watch true blood! Nothing really on it, doesn't save where you were watching from so have to fast forward every episode!"
199006,I had a great experience when ordering my pc. It was easy to track what stage it was on also it showed how many days that it’s been. They would also send email updates when they moved up in the stages.
139842,"Would love to just give a no star review, but this arrogant bunch of thieves think that they at least deserve some credit. I have been waiting since the beginning of March for them to fix my Tumble Dryer. Have had messages saying they are coming then then cancel the morning they are due to come with the excuse that they do not have the parts. I have been on hold for over an hour every time I have called in the last two weeks. Yesterday, I was abused by one of the so called ""Customer Service Team"" who rudely interrupted me and asked if I had ""finished my little rant"" I asked to speak to a supervisor and he informed me that there was no need to escalate the call to a higher level !!! I said that under the terms of my insurance I am entitled to a replacement, as they have not been able to fix it within seven days [not even seven weeks, and almost seven months] I was informed by my stroppy call handler that it does not work like that, so once again I asked to be put through to a supervisor. He told me this was not possible and that the supervisor would call me when they had time !!! 24 hours later and no call. Case ref CC4274406 - I am not sure that is even correct as I got the feeling the little s*** on the end of the line was just trying his best to annoy me and get me off the phone. I have never experienced such rudeness and arrogance. It is like they don't give a monkeys about the customers, who are incidentally paying their wages. Gone are the days when the customer is always right and being polite are courteous when you work as a call handler were standard practice. Making people hold on the phone for hours is disgraceful."
173640,"Filter arrived on time
Good quality and good price. Would use again"
112942,Very good service from both lads Craig d and ferenc.k both were very polite and helpful
163951,"I've called Shell energy to report that we moved home. I had to wait for more than 30 min to get through to a lovely lady who took some information and confirmed that account was closed. She then passed me to the sales team to open a new account where I waited for an hour then the line was disconnected. I called again and had to wait for another 43 minutes to speak to an agent that took some information to open the new account and said that he would call me again to confirm how will the refund me a credit bill. So, waiting time is 2 hrs plus minutes just to report a change of addresses.( Note I already submitted all information online before calling but needed to check about a credit bill.) I do expect a better customer service from Shell. If the opposite was true, then I don't think that Shell will not be happy to wait for hours to reach their clients. Please do improve your customer service."
195608,I left NOW TV a while back for reasons outlined in other reviews. But I kept getting lots of enticing offers to rejoin (£1 for movies for 3 months) so I thought perhaps give it another go? But I kept getting error messages saying I needed to log in and when I did saying that I needed to try later -this would continue ad nauseam so I thought I should try the 'help' chat. This was a little frustrating - help centre callers would be better advised I think to tell you at the outset what information they need rather than in a series of questions which serve to irritate 'Please tell me your name?' then 'Are you the account holder?' then Email? then 'address?' Arrggghh! So finally got all that out of the way and was expecting to be able to log in so that I could avail myself of their 'offers' only to find that he'd done the opposite! Sighhhhhh
177687,Speedy service and item was cheaper than Amazon.
120353,"ANOTHER update - so no call or contact from the so called excellence team, I rang up today after weeks of ringing, I spoke to lady who was rude, I continued to be nice but make my point until she accused me of shouting when I merely pointed out NICELY AND CALMLY the fact that they hadn’t contacted me! This pathetic company is isn’t worth one star either, they have NIL good quality and have no customer service.
For a complaint that was raised on 26/12, this company have made no attempt to correct their wrongdoing and promises.
I have never dealt with such an incompetent company!"
115444,"I was looking for a good deal for a specific Makita cordless drill and FFX came up when I googled the model. The price was much cheaper than elsewhere and included free postage.

Registering on the website was easy. Ordered the drill on Sunday and it was delivered on Monday - can't get much better than that. The tool arrived well wrapped in a jiffy bag rather than the usual Makita packaging, but I was expecting this, having read other reviews. Don't have a problem with this as the Makita box would have been thrown out anyway, but may have been disappointing if the item was to have been given as a gift.

Overall, very pleased with the service from FFX and will definitely use again."
120483,"Great choice, cheaper than most for the graphics card I purchased, fast delivery so from my own experience would definitely recommend to others."
128974,"Good information, easy to deal with, goods as advertised, fast free delivery."
189087,This is the second phone I have bought from them as I think they are good value for money and it works well. What I should have done was join there loyalty programme
172608,I haven’t even received them yet and it’s Christmas Day.Thanks a lot ghd
194555,Ordered a mobile phone contract on 3/2/20. Next day 4/2/20 received an email to phone them so I called them and they did my credit search with O2. Credit check passed and been told that it will be delivered the next day. Ok next day on 5/2/20 got an email that order has been cancelled becoz internal checks failed I phoned them and the manager said he will email the internal check dep if they can overturn the decision. On 7/2/20 got a phone call from a manager that we will deliver the phone but I’ll have to go to the store to provide 2 forms of photo ID. On 8/2/20 went to the store with IDs at 6pm and the store guy said he can’t accept it because internal check dep is closed now so come tomorrow. On 9/2/20 I was at work so couldn’t go to the store so I sent my husband with IDs but they didn’t accept it from him and said I have to be there. on 10/2/20 we both went again to the store and now they said they only keep order open for 7 days so that order is cancelled. So we decided to buy the phone deal from the store but now they don’t have it in stock. They promised to get it from another store by next week. Ok week after I received a phone call that it will take another 1 week. So finally after 2 week on Saturday we went to the store with IDs but the girl who promised was off sick so the other girl asked us to come on Sunday. Ok now Sunday we went again and now she said that she has the phone for us but that O2 deal isn’t available anymore and the new deal is costing me £300 more than the one I ordered. So finally after 5 visits of the store and waiting nearly a month I didn’t get the phone. Is this some kind of a joke? Getting a house mortgage wasn’t this difficult.
117733,"Product arrived on time and in good condition.
They only took the money from my bank once the item was dispatched, and they arrived the same day."
113464,"Ordered 2 photo personalized photo mugs no problems great price was given discount plus a voucher if I order again,so ordered the hard back photo book /keepsake very impressed 👍,very quick delivery 5 ⭐ highly recommend"
179425,"The phone was listed 'Good' but is, as new. Very pleased with it."
193533,I did enquire if the parts I was ordering would fit my Vax hoover But when they arrived they are for a Hoover Not my model or serial number So they snapped straight away Unfortunatly They was not suited Refund was given Thanking you Mr G Davies
150351,Always had first class service from Richer Sounds. Ery highly recommend them.
153522,Wi-Fi keeps dropping! (I have a baby monitor so the Wi-Fi Carnt be dropping!!) You Carnt get a hold of anyone/ the app is crap tried to reset my password and verify my online account but they won’t send me emails todo any of this!!
124198,"Absolutely terrible experience. Been with them for 5 years now. Moved house which required a technician for installation. They missed that appointment and did not provide any update. After rescheduling they booked in the wrong date and then told me the originally planned date was no longer available. It has been 2 weeks already and I still don't have internet. If any other company offered such speeds I would not have chosen this sorry excuse of a company in the first place. If you would like to pay an exorbitant amount of money in exchange for the worst service possible, go with virgin media."
179520,"I opted for PCspecialist after hearing good things from people who'd used them. And research showing me that it would be only slightly more expensive than building a PC myself without the hassle sourcing and testing the parts.

Using the configuration options on their site was easy and warned me when cases I looked at wouldn't hold the cooling option I wanted.

Ordering was straight forward and the only downside of the whole process was waiting for my PC to enter the build phase due to their popularity causing a backlog of builds. Once it hit the build phase it was only a few days between build and delivery which was great.

DPD delivered by 8am on the day they claimed, PC was well packaged and contained all the expected documents and extras.

2 weeks into owning the machine, very happy with it. More powerful than expected, super tidy cable management. It's a massive upgrade from what I was using before and so much quieter.
Definitely going to use PCspecialist for my next PC and probably a laptop when I replace my current one."
174962,"Awful service relating to a warranty repair. Website information was incorrect, store staff unaware of latest company policy. Agents on the phone unhelpful and hung up. Completely disjointed company."
142711,"Item was faulty, new one sent and was fine, so very pleased with response. Have always been satisfied with FFX!"
115002,Great communication. Responded promptly to emails to reassure me the PC would arrive before Xmas. It did and runs fantasticly.
192163,"I had an issue with my ghd straightener. I went to check online for my guarantee period and I was told they were out of it. That was not correct as they are the Gold series and are meant to have 3 years guarantee (they were bought in Dec 2019). I spoke with the customer service and they told me I could send them back as, quite rightly, they were still within the guarantee period. They sent me a link for the return form and prepaid label to return them.
Initially, the link did not work for me. I wrote them back requesting a new one but I have never received a response back again. My email was sent on the 25/11/21. The agent I was dealing with was Victoria Fajilade.
After a number of times trying and on the lack of any response, I managed to get the initial link to work and I have sent the straightener back to Ghd.
So far I have not received any further news about them.
As this issue has not been resolved as quickly as I thought it would be, I have had to buy a new set of straighteners with the consequent cost.
Overall, really disappointed with the customer service level comparing with what I would have expected from Ghd.
I have 5 Ghd items and buy regularly products buy this experience will make me reconsider buying anything else in the future."
170018,Absolutely terrible company in my opinion. I ordered a fully integrated Dishwasher late January for it be delivered and installed by AO for a Sunday after waiting all day i got a phone call half hour before expected delivery time( 6:00 pm ) to say the driver had run out of driving hour's and couldn't make reranged for the following Thursday all was okay the driver and the installation enginer turned up and refused to fit the appliance stating it was impossible as the wrong Dishwasher door type was ordered!! .I tried to explain to the technician that this was my second Dishwasher and the first one was a fixed hindge and the broken down is a sliding hindge type . The plinth at the bottom of the kitchen cabinets was notched out to make it universal for both type of door/ hindge system's. The installer just shook his head and told me it was impossible to install and him and driver drove of ..Googled a local supplier and installer paid less for the same appliance and installed without a fuss in around half a hour ..A O need to employ Profesional competent people who know what they are doing !! .Contacted A.O customer services to complain but didn't get any where as they backed the installation guy. They did however promised to send me discounts code's to use on the website as a good will gesture however unfortunately im still waiting for them..will never use these cowboy company again..
180521,I bought my PC based on my son's recommendation who purchased one last year from them. I am glad I took his advice. Took a little longer to arrive than I had hoped but was definitely worth the wait.
179449,"Ordered a washing machine, paid £20 for installation.

Guys turned up, said they were agency drivers, not trained to plumb in the machine and they have no tools, not a great start.

Upon receipt of the machine, we've noticed a huge dent in the front, we have taken pictures. The bad start just got worse.

The machine is still working ok so purely because my wife and I work long hours, cannot be without a machine again due to having children and the inconvenience of the last delivery we have decided to keep the dented machine.

I called Very to advise them of our poor customer journey, wanting my money back for the installation service that wasn't provided and given the defected machine I expected a gogw off the cost of the machine (principle rather than needing the money).

Over 30 minutes speaking to someone only to find she couldn't process the refund for the installation service and was offered 4% in compensation which didn't even equate to half of my hourly rate (spent on the phone trying to sort)

Very, very, very, bad experience.

Hi D,

I'm sorry to hear that, but glad to hear they have offered a discount and refund of install. We appreciate and value your feedback.

Thanks,
John


*** hasn't even read the review before responding ... absolutely embarrassing service ***

Calling today to arrange a collection and full refund and wont use very again."
164439,"I sent a spotless iPhone 12 Pro Max, absolutely zero scratches on the casing, camera, screen. I had the price slashed from £465 to £375 due to multiple scratches on the casing which was completely untrue. I’ve never had the phone without a case or screen protector on it. I checked it thoroughly and it was immaculate. I rejected the offer and requested my phone back, 2 days later I got another offer of £395, I don't think so you con merchants!!
I took photos of the phone before sending so I would know if any have been added if they were to return it. Absolutely disgraceful"
180094,"Not the first time I’ve used these guys, so far to date two iPads and three phones… each purchase has been hassle free and finalised in no time at all with the delivery being like the icing on a rather tasty but affordably priced cake!
I got lucky and checked the site at around 2am and the January sale was on and the iPad Air 2019 3rd generation that I’d been looking at was marked down by £225!

Cannot recommend highly enough 👍🖖"
192890,Returned because of first class service
191643,Quick and efficient service. Great choice.
158273,Utterly useless. For the past month I've been getting cut off constantly for the whole day due to BT having such a bad service. I pay for fibre but would be better using my local coffee shop's wifi
145960,I was looking for a portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker. With Olivia's help we narrowed it down to one speaker the JBL Flip 5 which was on offer to VIP Customers. I has considered the Sonos 1 but she said the JBL had better sound quality and I had mentioned I didn't need Alexa ot the like.
134786,Was mis sold a Broadband only package which started on the 2/11/22 explained I wanted a package with the fastest download speeds was told the best one was a broadband only package at £56.00 a month I have had nothing but trouble from the start I have a recording of the agent on the phone telling me he could see my broadband had gone down over 120 times in the first month eventually they agreed to send out an engineer who from the start wanted to blame the games console then when he started testing it was the router but then with a new router still having the same problem so have decided to change my service to another provider and a faster rate and a cheaper price virgin want me to pay £112.00 I have paid them £56.00 But don't think I should pay for a month of no service that even an engineer can't fix.
157330,Worst customer service I've experienced. Refused to close my account due to THEIR order on my account. An order I did not authorise. And what's worse? They want me to call again to close to the account even after receiving my instruction.
192568,"I placed my order on 4th December, it’s 4th January now and no response to my enquiries. I sent loads of emails, and still no response. Awful customer service.
I don’t know what to do now, I NEED HELP."
169703,"I have a lot of tech / appliances with D&G and i have requested 2 call outs, 1 for my oven and 1 to sent my ipad screen to be replaced. Very trustworthy and my products were mended and fixed within the next week even in December busy month period, very impressed and always had a clear and good service over the phone too!"
132375,"Sent 2 large boxes of books using their free pick up service. I met the courier who scanned them both.

The couriers tracking showed that they have been delivered but Music Magpie claimed to not recieve one of them and will not pay out for their mistake.

Last time I use them to buy or sell."
191221,So out of the blue I was not able to stream Now TV on any of my devices at any individual given time…. Contacted their help line they told me it was an issue with my internet provider asked what was the issue they replied you are on a USA platform I was like ok… called my internet provider sky they did all the checks and definitely not on a USA platform. Went back to NOW tv explained sent them screen shots etc…. They still insisted it was my internet providers issue… so I went back to sky and they did all the checks again…. Went back to Now tv explained they then had me disconnect all the devices and reboot my internet made no difference then they said they would escalate to their technical team… I asked if they could pause the payment due to come out or make a note they said no I am too continue paying whilst they resolve this issue… I waited a week not a word from them I cancelled my subscription then I hear from them advising me that they can only work on technical issues for paying customers!!!! Unbelievable
145465,Brilliant deal found on phone. New phone and paying less. Phone came the next day.
141830,They charged me for a phone which they didn’t even give me and then refused to send me the full refund so I paid for a phone bill without receiving the phone or a refund. It’s a horrible company who are just stealing from people.
138065,"Good quality goods, well priced, excellent service."
165417,"Not only was Virgin's customer service terrible (we were put on hold, told there was a tech outage, and then when someone finally answered they said we'd phoned the wrong number, which was not possible) but after our initial installation, the WiFi was so bad we called for a second engineer - and he turned up and said that the first Virgin engineer had 'cut the wires' because the job looked too complicated and they couldn't be bothered. Literally the worst Wifi service I've ever had.

I see a lot of reviews saying that customer service is bad but the broadband speeds are at least worth it - but this hasn't been my experience at all! Broadband has been incredibly slow and Virgin have offered no explanation."
191274,"10/10, all good. A few days before Christmas, standard delivery cost for a heavy item (car battery). Ordered 2.15PM Wednesday, arrived 7.30AM Thursday, carefully packed and delivered to the door. Now that's what I call efficient...Well done Tayna, and well done DX Delivery."
106795,Very professional I’m satisfied with the service
158291,"Placed an order for a laptop, the laptop was put together, tested and mailed out to me in less than 1 week
Great service and the laptop runs very well."
144815,There is one particular gentleman that’s works in your Worthing store West Sussex that’s always very knowledgeable and very helpful and friendly!
138896,"We were served by a lady called Sharon. She told us everything we needed to know. Very helpful and we had a right laugh. She's coming for dinner, to show me how to use it properly."
176236,The fitter arrived early in our time slot & was finished in under an hour. The only downside was that we had to wait three weeks probably due to the holidays.
148836,"I had to order the phone twice due a typing error, when I sopke to team member I was told that the first payment would not be taken as the order did not go through, and I would need to order tge phone again, which I did. The original payment was then taken along the the replacement and I am still trying to get it refunded but have been told now I have to wait 14 days from the order to be cancelled and then a further 3 to 5 days for the refund. Very poor service for a customer who has just spent £1000.00 with you."
103854,"No stars would be more appropriate! 1.5 hours trying to speak to a Manager, disconnected 4 times up until now Ahmed has just disconnected me AGAIN and back to being 23 in the queue. I have asked about 15 times that I want to raise a complaint and speak to a Manager and the answer is lets cut this customer off! So directly to the Communications Ombudsman as clearly they have no complaint process! Roll on renewal of my contract!"
198816,"Very easy ordering, arrived quickly and well packaged.
Would definitely use again."
171064,I’m still waiting on my delivery. Was due to arrive between the 10th and 25th if Dec.
184157,"All I want to do is update bt cloud to the latest version and I can not find an answer anywhere to allow me to do this; maybe I am looking in the wrong place, but if I am then the guidance notes are crap."
138327,"Engineer arrived on time, tested washing machine but
had to order a new control panel which could be 7 - 10 days,
So I cannot as yet comment on final outcome."
114701,"I have used this service for several years and any problems that have
come up on my computer have always been solved to my satisfaction and I have truly found the help invaluable."
139333,"Certainly do what they say 'on the tin'
Speedy Delivery, Will use again."
108508,"Part of my deal was I will receive a £250 gift card. I signed up in September we are now in December!!! 3 mobile have tried playing the the first Direct Debit did not go through. There was no reason for it to not go through and on the day of the payment I called them to manually make the payment, the payment surprise, WENT through and the agent said as long as the payment was made withing 7 days you still get the gift card. This is 3 mobile not living up to their side of the agreement the deal and this is not good customer service what so ever!!! Resolve this issue immediately!!!"
173764,If you want a weak dribble of Internet then look no further. Tie yourself into a two year contract to enjoy substandard connection and then once you tell them you're leaving them it appears they punish you for your last days by making it even more terrible than you remember
100502,"The whole process is easy from order to delivery, product is excellent all very efficient and professional."
191222,"The battery was not delivered on the day promised, and then was later than the agreed time slot the following day. This caused me a problem with taking time off to take delivery."
150026,"Easy to order, prompt delivery. Excellent service overall"
172504,"If anyone is thinking of ordering from these folks please reconsider! Order cancelled on 24/04/2020 and still no refund, even though I have been stalled and promised repeatedly. If it looks and smells like a scam.."
158325,Excellent CD and rapid delivery again.Perfect.
123014,Excellent and very prompt service and delivery.
157195,Ordered invitations for my babies christening an they was exactly how they were when I designed them would definitely be ordering agian
150723,I ordered the Samsung QE50QN90BATXXU and it had very quick delivery would use again
137808,Great quality products at a great price. Shipped fast as well.
159465,I am absolutely fuming. I took out a new contract through Carphone warehouse and was sent 2 SIM cards. As the number in the welcome letter mentioned a mobile number I started using it and threw the other one away as didn’t need 2 SIM cards. I have waited 30 days for my old number to be transferred to pay and go so I can keep my old number now to be told that I apparently took out 2 contracts!!!!!!! Absolute joke
185056,Great communication throughout the order friendly staff at store when I collected
160487,"As always with ghd speedy delivery, great products. Will definitely use again."
153093,"I decided to replace my 10 year old PC with a liquid series PC (mid kit) and went all out with the RTX 4090 GPU. Throughout the process the team were super helpful and ultra-flexible in refunding and altering parts on my order (total bill was a little over £5K). The PC looks great and everything I wanted to pre-installed with no bloatware. Gaming is great on this machine. Although I missed the xmas cutoff (I wasn't looking to get it by xmas anyway) the build and shipping was fast (11 business days which included time for amendments)

My only gripe is that they used palletforce for delivery and as a policy they make you come to the road to collect your package (liquidseries PCs are not light and I'm injured, I live in a block of flats where the building is inset from the road) and the policy is that they won't help me to the lift (something that is not explained on the site as of 15/01/23, I only found out the day before) - luckily I managed to find someone with a sac barrow on the day. I was asked not to include palletforce in this review but PC specialist chose to use them, not me. Consider changing to a more reputable delivery company, I've always been able to have packages delivered to my property before from other businesses."
152577,"Another (attempted) call to bt ""customer service"" line and another 45 min wait before I had to hang up due to other commitments. Massive underinvestment in customer service, it's like they don't care..."
147001,After waiting over 2 weeks I still have not received the item ordered. I have chased ghd directly twice as the courier has claimed to have tried to deliver this but left no card and I have received no confirmation of where my order is an order of over £100
138459,"Received my parcel on date expected but my only complaint is yodel who delivered it didn’t leave it with my neighbour as requested as I wasn’t home but sent me a text saying my parcel was in its safe place and they had left a note through letterbox to say where it was . I came home to find parcel on doorstep , which anyone could have taken and no note ."
168982,"Excellent company to do business with. Ordered close to Christmas, given rough idea of delivery as stocks low and emailed regularly about progress.
It turned out that it came much sooner than expected as company got delivery early too and got items out to customers really quickly. Would not hesitate to use again"
102369,This is the second time I have brought parts from Buy spares and they have delivered the parts in a good time. The parts are reasonably priced. What more can you want.
118582,"I called Sky on 03337592150 to get a broadband quote. And the customer service guy offered me NOWTV Broadband. He wanted to take my details. I said I don't want to give any details until I make up my mind as nowtv is not what I was initially after. The guy spoke in a very high tone and very loud, being offended and said he is a professional. I said I'm not in rush, so I want to consider his offer first. He suddenly rudely ended the call."
130252,Swift service and no faffing. Two items arrived on time while the third got caught up in the postal strike and took a little longer. But all items arrived now in good order
121288,"Have purchased a few different appliances from here over the years. They always arrive in perfect condition and they do what they say they will. Pricing and selection of products are very reasonable and the sales are great. I was able to get next day delivery (for a Saturday) of a fridge freezer. They were the only company who could do this. Thank you.

The company you use for deliveries (Arrowxl) are the worst. Paid to have the item unwrapped but they tried to leave it still wrapped. When we said we paid extra for unwrapping and rubbish taking with them, the driver sighed and made little effort to unwrap. Wouldn't pay for extra services again. ArrowXLs attitude stinks! Please offer more delivery companies

Appliance Direct were great in dealing with the issues I raised around my courier experience and they have a lifetime customer with me. Excellent customer service, really going that extra mile and taking feedback seriously. Thank you"
194814,"They are not even worth the one star.. their staff in south Africa are very unhelpful and tell lies as far as I'm concerned. 3 oled LG TV at £1,100 since 23rd of December and still sitting at home with a faulty tv.. disgusting isn't the word. please be advised if buying from currys PC world their after care is, well I cant swear but you know what I mean."
169686,"Super easy, nice, professional, help without asking for it xx"
127138,Kept in the loop (messages) regarding my order and delivery dates and times. Drivers sent message 15 minutes out from delivery address - the guys were great. Very helpful respectful and good away the rubbish / packaging g along with my old sppliancr. Cannot fault service and delivery. Thank you.
166628,"Great and easy order process, quick and safe delivery."
103923,"Quick efficient repair , knowledgeable and polite engineer"
100115,Ordered a replacement dishwasher cutlery tray. Arrived on time and was the exact same as the original. Very happy with the item.
191439,"Absolutely horrible. It seems like on every device their app is practically nonfunctional. Nearly missed a game because it insisted I was streaming on another device even though I had definitely closed it everywhere else, and so I actually had to go uninstall it on my computer and my Xbox to get it to work. The different memberships can also be quite confusing to figure out what you are actually getting with each one. For how much the subscriptions cost all of this is absolutely unacceptable."
177306,The Engineer arrived on time and was really helpful to repair and gave good advice regarding my appliance. He was also professional and coouteous.
177831,"Hello iI gave this sore based on the fact of an engineers report to D&G. The seals around the door were gone, he didn't tell me but whatever he told his company they condemed it immediately and I got a brand new cooker. What other score could I give, excellent. Very pleased.
Ceci Taylor."
152182,The rubbish provider ever. Customer support is ridiculous. It’s been 4 months and issue will never get sorted. Won’t suggest this to anyone. Literally scam 🤮🤮
146882,Didn’t fix my machine. Cancelled my policy. No communication until I eventually got hold of them
144177,"Having had a poor experience with another phone buying site previously I thought I’d try Envirofone this time based on the positive reviews but I wasn’t hoping for much so when they contacted me to say they had received my phone and were transferring the amount they originally offered by 8pm that day I was delighted. It was a really easy, positive experience and I will definitely use them again."
154946,"Excellent customer support. Cardiff took the time to discuss options and details of specific products.
It helped me understand tech developments.
Thank you."
130467,"Their discounts give someone like me, a producer on a budget, some great options. Some of their plug-ins are quite incredible"
108253,"I can say I had a laptop until I booked it in for a repair. It was purchased at pc currys with insurance that supposed to cover what ever happens. After it stopped working I took it in to one of their stores for a repair and haven't seen my laptop or heard anything about it. So the 14day promise can be forgotten. The only message I got from them was that they are waiting on parts to be delivered. After 14 days I called to find out when I'm getting a laptop thinking that since the 14 days is up they will have to sort me out with a laptop immediately. It's been 2 weeks after the 14 days promise still no laptop not the old one not a replacement or new one. I have called them 10 times since and its quite funny because the only thing I get from them is ""tomorrow they are looking into it"". I had a care plan that I paid for for nearly 5 years and all I got back was tomorrow and nothing else mind you they have my money that I have paid for insurance all those years and my laptop. Would I recommend team knowhow for consumers absolutely not. All they said to me is tomorrow I'm sorry there is nothing we can do but wait. They had my laptop for so long that the monthly plan I got with them to pay my insurance is been taken for the second time and no laptop for me. Please stay away from their care plan and insurance plans. Nothing but bad negative feed back and now I know why. I could of saved all that money that was payed for the insurance sold my old laptop went to the store and bought me a laptop immediately and it would work out cheaper and faster would have a laptop immediately not having to wait a month."
142230,"Really bad company, signed up for the basic package and was being charged for sky sports and boost which I never signed up for. Showed all the paper work to prove what I had signed up for and somehow all these extras got added to my package without my consent and were unwilling to give me a full refund. I won’t be renewing my contract with now tv again"
112824,"Great selection of products and personalised gifts. Prices are good, especially sales.
Interest rates are high though, but for bigger items I’ve used the interest free option. Easy to use app and account"
145096,The item I ordered. Was in my house within 2 days. Great service.
108475,My experience today was so very good because of the help I received from Magdelana. She was very kind and patient and helpful. She is a shining star. God bless her. Her professional and kind help gave me confidence in Shell. She is a wonderful ambassador for Shell.
148561,Did not receive the smart extension cable.

They used to blame most issue with Customer Services, on being run by foreigners, SADLY NOTHING HAS IMPROVED but got worse. Will give them till Monday to sort my issues, failing that Take this Kit out."
132094,I came to the Bury store to purchase a laptop. As I am not familiar with them I asked for help. Along came Alirio better known as Rio. What a help full and knowledgeable young man. He completely put me at ease and answered all my question. As I am a senior citizen some of my questions my have seemed rather strange but he answered them without being condescending. We did have a giggle though. This chap is a credit to the team and company he deserves a PAY RISE. Thankyou Rio.
165522,Good site to navigate. Delivered exactly on due date.
169882,Constant flow of customer requests. Very easy to interpret customer needs based on posts. Great price structure to purchase leads.
131259,Do not touch this company with a barge pole. Ordered phone in March paid for it but not received it. They keep saying will get refund but still waiting. Now in the hands of my credit card to get my money back.

195169,"Ordered a phone (iphone 6S) , it came 3.5 weeks later. Bit disapointing for the time it took as you tend to need a phone when you order one and it wasnt within the 10 working days but it arrived and is in good nick. I have used these guys in the past for my kids and the quality of the rf phones are generally very good. I did see all the recent reviews and rececived similar responses to my request for its whereabouts as others so feared the worst. However to give credit, it arrived today, is ok and apart from the delay no complaints."
188976,I always buy from Richer sounds they are the cheapest and have great advice and the website is so easy to use. I also signed up to VIP access and got my item even cheaper. I love my new speaker.

154074,Purchased LG tv on line. Selection and order process was very easy. Good selection of products. Price was right. Local store collection was good. My only gripe was having to wait a few days as item not held locally. This is the second tv I have bought from Curry's recently. Happy.
149305,Excellent item very fast delivery super service thanks
136375,"Engineer attended and fixed oven issue very quickly and professionally. I was notified of attendance time and he arrived very promptly within the hours stated. Did a quick, professional job."
150058,"Customer service is non existent. Total liars, scumbags and complete fools. The amount of time wasted on the phone trying to do their job for them.

You can see the other reviews here, they had a nice purple rebrand but they are still losers."
190389,I have tried unsuccessful to renew my insurance with this company today. (13 AUG). after 3 attempts I gave up as it was costing me too much on phone calls/time.
109784,I try and buy most of my tvs/headphones etc from here because they are always good value and customer service is excellent. They know what they are talking about and take the time to explain anything if unsure

149213,Just what we needed! Fast delivery too!
120257,Great service from Oliver and Ellis. Upgraded from sim only Although I asked a lot of questions and they were very patient with me. Ellis was very good at explaining things I wasn’t sure. Had an issue with my email so called back and spoke to dom who was super friendly felt like chatting to a friend. He went above and beyond to make sure I didn’t leave the call until my issue was rectified (this was nothing to do with Ellis or Oliver). Would recommend thanks guys keep it up!

Excellent quality for small price."
145187,"So I was actually very disappointed as I was made to be believe by pictures that they were in photo frames , instead I spent £60 on just rolled up posters which we're a nightmare to even get straight, but the quality is good and thick not thin like paper."
185291,Excellent service. Great info - fast service.
121665,Very happy. Easy process. Only issue was that no Adda staff at a couple of branches seemed aware that they had the service but very easy in the end.

194562,"I'm going to cut this very short otherwise it will drain me more that it already has.

It has taking us nearly 3 months ( still havnt got it) to get broadband into our new property.

Atlest 10 phone calls. On the same excuse..

'Need a special engineer' amount of review dates we get is ridiculous. 3months and still not sorted.. raising it as complaints to the highest level does absolutely nothing.. its like they read of a script. They don't phone back when they say they will. It is affecting our jobs. Never in a million years did I think a company on this size can treat us so poorly.

Had a phone call saying the rest of the external work will be done Thurdsay and then get a message saying next review date is the 19th. So which one is it. Am I waiting in for them or not.

BT are damaging my relationship with them, and this rate i would not recommend them.

3 months, numerous phone calls, time and stress. Just to be told the same thing. I'm just so shocked and stressed and don't know what to do. Have scarred me for life if we move again."
193007,"The battery was exactly as described, fitted perfectly and is a better rated unit than was fitted originally all for an unbeatable price. Thank you and if I need a battery in the future you will be my first port of call."

I paid for an iPhone X almost 2 months ago I requested a refund after being told my phone wouldn’t be dispatched inside the 14 day time frame.
After countless emails of promises to refund I ended getting a charge back through my bank. I won’t be going near them in the future."

121529,"Very angry! Me, my husband and his family all changed to three pay as you go because this summer they had a deal £10 for 16 gb data which becomes £20 if auto-renewed! Two of us didn’t get the promised 20gb but it auto renewed until today! We were getting steady 16gb. When I woke up to no credit and now had to pay £10 for 10gb! The other two people didn’t get auto renewal in the first month so they got 20gb from the start but then had to pay £10 again for a 10gb package! We have been lied to! We changed provider and phone number and all that hustle because we thought 3 was providing a great deal but we didn’t get what was promised! I am leaving this company as soon as my data pack runs out because I doubt next month I will get the 20gb promised as I doubt the auto renew will go through again! Connected to live chat and all they were able to tell me was the plan I have active and what I had active before - thank you - I already knew that! The guy promised I would get 20gb next month if auto renew but I don’t trust the auto renewal because all 4 of us didn’t get auto renewal at some point even though we didn’t change the setting!"

128826,"Love how everyone jumps on here with their complaints - yet when satisfied no one bothers! I have received immaculate customer service today from Elliot C - has not only managed to find a conclusion to my problem but has done so in such a professional manner I am so impressed. I have had hit and miss customer service in the past from BT however, despite some bumps along the way I cannot fault today's customer service. Not only sorted my issue but also made me feel a lot happier in myself with a more positive attitude for the day during a very sad period! Thank you Elliot =)"

It went very smoothly without a hitch, and I'm saving £20 a month, better speed, and a digital phone/line.
Spoke to sales (Jenny) on Monday morning, and by Tuesday morning I was at 150 mps.
It's not normally so easy- so well done this time!"
148928,"Reading through the reviews and seeing a lot of negative reviews, and I could not agree more! ordered a phone well over 2 and a bit months ago, having to email them every other week because there had been no sign of my phone, and would receive no contact from quickmobilefix with no updates about the phone I had purchased unless i contacted them first! After 2 months had passed and still no phone, I have finally had enough and asked for my money back, I am now worried after seeing other reviews that they are equally as slow to give the money back, even though they are quick enough to take it! I can appreciate that times are tough for business's due to covid 19, but the company had left no indication on their website to show that it would take longer than usual for the phone to arrive but nearly 3 months is a bit excessive, and would not have given quick mobile fix my money if I had known the issues that would come my way. I hope that it does not take the same amount of time for them to give my money back as they did with the phone i purchased, as it looks like i will never have my money back, £450 is a lot of money for myself, so im just hoping as a saving grace they will give my back within the 14 days they promised."
146869,"The in-store service from Cardphone warehouse is excellent but online and remote services are awful. Sent a phone (which was less than a year old and covered by my warranty) away for repair, it was returned with no note or details and still broken. When I called for more details, the repairs team gave me three different excuses for why it wasn’t covered (repeatedly changing the reason every time I queried or challenged it). They then told me the only way to resolve it was to travel to my nearest store (an hour away) just as the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were easing/stores were staring to reopen. The store staff were so lovely and sympathetic (even stating that they could plainly see the “cosmetic damage” reasons the repairs team mentioned weren’t true) but advised that their hands were tied due to the repairs team system notes. The store advised me that the only option I really had left was to complain but I got nowhere from this perspective either. Spent a fortnight calling their customer service line only to be disconnected or hung up on every time. Emailed their team who advised me to call their customer service line (again). When I finally got through I was then advised that the only way to get feedback from a complaint was to email the same address that had previously told me to call their customer service line. Honestly such a waste of time. A series of being redirected and going in circles. I’ll never purchase from them again."

112304,"Since moving house 3 months ago I have endured delays in set up/connections and received 3 routers that I did not request. The consequences have been unbearably stressful and in spite of making all returns I was e mailed today to say that I will have £50 added to my next bill. I do have proof of postage. Am I obliged to waste my time and petrol driving to a Post Office to return goods that I have not requested? Surely BT has responsibility for dispatch of its hardware? Can a company send unwanted/unrequested goods and then charge me? Is this legal? What are my rights? BT reviews are poor so you have problems. Does this company have an ethical policy? If communication is your business you have in my opinion failed totally. Please reassure customers, not with platitudes but by immediate service improvement. Don’t send me to Twitter or Facebook, I don’t go there. This is currently a no star service."

PC runs fabulously with no problems and has not only met the requirements for all my games but exceeded them, website really shining through there by not letting me click purchase on a PC that would not function.

Raised 3 complaints to bout professional behaviour or Cs staff using BT messaging service, all 3 complaints closed without resolution, what use of complaining to raise standards if they ignore complaints.

Wonder how many customers they lose within 24 hours of service being connected, well they lost mines, treat customers with professional curtesy you may retain them, for £20 I go from paltry 30Mbs to 312Mbs full fibre and less bad customer services.

Fao Robbie, no need to get in touch with your social media team, if bt support couldn't resolve the issue less likely the social media can do differently, but after just 1 day service, I cancelled BT, still 30 days of service avail but won't use it, I have switched to another provider"

159408,"Love the Argos card, such a convenience"
101699,"It was pretty good, the service was very responsive with any answer i gave them but where very vague and needs to be more direct for new customer who know few things about pcs. The time it took for them to just build the pc was horrendous, having the expected time to be 16 to 19 days but then taking a whole month, but to be fair, it wasnt their fault since the gpu shortage and corona. But my over all experience was quite good and would strongly recommend for people who just want to own a pc and not build it."

116519,"Was sold a dream, advised I cant get my free 2 games with my desktop I spend almost £3000 on. Advisor said he cant help and wont escalate or get support.

I work in IT as a service manager and I knew what he said was all BS!

Overall experiance was poor as no support from customer service about this issue, was pushed and pared off like I dont understand. No information could be gathered with the amd combo cpu and GPU deal after and was refused on the spot and told to go away.

Would be great if they did something or tried to understand from a customers point of view, I even sent screenshots of the order, I have 2 witness who build this machine with me and still no support from pc specialist I only went with them because they where based in the UK. I would have gone with NZXT but they wouldnt deliver to the UK at the time of COVID.

Out of pocket and disappointed from a service and build point if view!

Wish I could just return this item and forget I even brought this stupid thing from pc specialist."

138796,"AVOID AVOID AVOID at all costs. I should have read the reviews before sending my iPhone 13 pro max. I was originally offered £550 for good condition, phone less than 12mths old in perfect condition. Mazuma received phone and advised me the screen needed replacing so classed as faulty and offered £190. I rejected straight away as there was nothing wrong with my screen. They then sent a further email saying they had reassessed my phone and upped the payment to £315, I mean this screams out they are ripping people off. Again I declined, got my phone back sent it to music magpie who have just paid me £590.00 saying my phone is in perfect condition. Mazuma you should be ashamed of yourself ripping your customers off.. especially as people are desperate at the min! absolutely disgusting... please everyone avoid and go to music magpie .. i ended up with £40 more than mazuma were originally offering. I will never use you again.. shame cause i have used you a number of times in the past ... AVOID AVOID AVOID the reviews are all true

*** Updated mazuma I see you post the same reply on these poor reviews … please don’t insult my intelligence!! As stated music Magpie confirmed was phone was in perfect condition and paid me £590 … AVOID AVOID AVOID***"

171993,"Paid £200 in Bark credits. Messaged 30 people with my services. (I get plenty of custom from Google) my only responses were;

First response: I only want to work with women (totally fair but Bark should not be showing me these leads as a male - I had set my preferences for this)
- Second: Please stop sending me these messages (clearly getting spammed) as I only sent one very short polite intro

I hardly write reviews but in this instance I felt compelled. I don’t know where these ‘leads’ are coming from but they were absolutely no value to me.

When I contacted Bark for a refund of credits for the ‘lead’ that only wanted a female they refused. Pretty poor service to be honest and I would certainly explore other areas of marketing/lead generation for your business.

*My business has only five star reviews on Google so am very surprised with that conversion rate. Not one customer from the whole investment. Questionable…"

To add insult to injury it took several attempts to get any kind of email from them because the first person i spoke to wrote my email address down wrong.
Not bloody impressed."

Phoned and told its an openreach issue and they have to respond. 10 days later finally someone says actually Now never put the order ID through and we’ve been being lied to the whole time. Still absolutely no resolution on when we will get internet, but being held hostage to this contract to get any kind of compensation. A very poorly run process with no safeguards, no contact process and lying about the order (which they admitted has been done)."
194639,Unfortunately it seems to have been stuck at the royal mail depot. It’s been scanned twice and not moved for the last 7 days. It’s now been 12 days since its dispatch. No it isn’t directly hmv’s fault but perhaps they should invest in another delivery service?!!!

However, I was shocked at the size of the travel case which is a very large hard case with much wasted space. This does not make the case travel friendly at all.

172473,"So after my previous complaints,
Your team have managed to start adding insult to injury by giving false information/lying.
Now your team tell me my laptop was written off.
My laptop I can assume was delivered to the wrong person as I received the wrong laptop on the 3/4/2020 - (a week after it was meant to be) , which you have now collected.
Although not a satisfactory solution to my complaint, the email I was told to expect to receive promising to offer vouchers for a new laptop has not materialised.
What concerns me is that, you apparently wrote off my laptop or wiped it clean to factory settings during repair.
In which case, can TeamKnowHow explain how I was able to track my laptop ( when it was not meant to be traceable) on the 13th APRIL 2020 at approx 20:03hrs to an address in Bexley, Kent on 21% battery charge? Also how is it the battery has now died?
Can you explain why you have not followed up the address information on last location?
I handed in the information with the returned incorrect laptop.

This is now over a month and I want this resolved.

TeamKnowHow - aka Ryan- the answer to your question is -: No.
My complaint has not been resolved and certainly not to my satisfaction.
You may track my case by making direct contact.
I want to know exactly what work you did to my laptop, when and what you are doing ensure I am fully compensated for this."

All the sugar coated words your employees use delivering a 0 star experience in insane. Just avoid THREE. PLEASE!!! NOT WORTH IT"

2. 6y warranty at reasonable cost gives confidence to purchase and from experience is honoured without any problems. I feel Richer sounds will still be in business in 6y time - unlike some competitors.
3. Mail order system gives next day delivery and saves on fuel & parking costs but I do enjoy a visit to the local store !"

171432,"Fantastic service from the delivery staff Tommy and Lee as they made sure everything was ok and give me some extra information to help with setting up the refrigerator.
Keep up the good work your both a credit to the company."
126980,Absolutely shocking. Have been waiting since 30th October for an order. Order still hasn't arrived and is now deemed lost. Studio are refusing to replace my item and have stated they need 30 days for investigation. Customer service don't speak any English & refused to put me through to their manager
148355,"After 4 hours and 4 attempts of trying to purchase over £1000 worth of electronics goods. My money was taken and order cancelled!! They are not interested in the inconvenience this has caused and have passed the buck to others.
These goods are still available to order and yet my order was automatically cancelled.
The web chat didn’t work twice, online didn’t and the store visit was a waste of time. Why are Currys staff and customers service not interested in helping or compensating for their bad company operations.
There isn’t even a working app! It is so bad that I am taking my money elsewhere when I eventually get it back."
166834,"I am in my mid 70's and found PC Specialist to be a terrific company to deal with. I am not a gamer and I will be using my bespoke PC for video editing. Advise on my build over a 10 day period before ordering was second to none. PC arrived and had an engineer to set it up, again this was a great service provided by PC Specialist. So all in all thank you guys."
160442,Delivery was prompt but i was dissapointed to find that the battery needs replacing as it runs down quickly and the mobile gets hot . I thought that this would have been checked before sale.
186537,The site is clear and the information made it easy to make my choice with a prompt delivery service. Really pleased with the product.
192148,"Very misleading, didn’t receive the feee gift offer (hairbrush) on calling customer service agent advised you don’t get free gift if you use a promotion code! Apparently it’s in the terms and conditions!"
152418,Very nice books and pleased with them BUT the packaging was inadequate and burst open during transportation. The plastic bag offered no protection to the three books.

130783,"I placed an order 7 days before moving to arrange for broadband and telephone to be deactivated/ reactivated. I’m now 39 days past the agreed activation date with no finish date in sight. In the last month I have made over 20 phone calls and have been lied to and fed utter rubbish continually. If it wasn’t for the fact I desperately need open reach to deliver a new cable, I would be cancelling the order. To make matters worse BT have still taken / payments whilst delivering no service. I don’t even have a phone number."

164994,"The company did very well and dealt with my order quickly, unfortunately it took almost two weeks to arrive due to postal strikes"
157567,Shop assistant was very patient and polite
189294,Never again will I join them the ripping me off (stealing my money) with charge of cancellation when there customer service said I can move to another company without a charge. Worst company
144811,Just a hopeless Network. Me and wife been with them and every month for the past 6months; we don’t get “auto renewal” and we have to “chat” to a robot and takes ages to set up this auto renewal that doesn’t even renew the following month… so the Best bet now is to just get our PUK codes and just leave this network; it’s poorly ram Network.

157691,"I love Argos, I’ve been buying from them for years and years and have never had any issues at all with them. They have a good range of things to buy, the only thing I wish they had more variety with is skincare and makeup but for home buys this is the place to get it from, fair prices and same day delivery. Also having the choice to buy now pay later interest free is amazing. I definitely recommend this company"
171149,Awful customer service take your money and nothing arrives... ask for a refund and nothing arrives ... avoid like the plague! If the people at quick mobile fix spent more time dispatching goods and communicating with their customers .and less time reporting honest reviews maybe things would run a little smoother!!! I have now contacted trading standards and my bank as it seems to be the only way to get a refund....
151742,"Excellent service! Early delivery … Garry J and Shaun F were polite and helpful!

Thank you"
145826,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I ordered Ralph Lauren trainers, and got sent a Studio’s own lounge set. I contacted them as soon as I knew and got told that they’d need to collect the item, I’d have to wait 14 days to get a refund and then I would have to repurchase the item. They said they specifically could not resend the right item even though they were collecting the wrong item, and still had my money - I could t be sent what I had ordered and paid for because of their mistake. Honesty I’m disgusted, annoyed and upset as everywhere else online retails these trainers for around £40 more. I couldn’t afford to simply repurchase whilst saving for Christmas presents and I work at a very similar company where if a customer receives the wrong order, we send out the correct item immediately and even let them keep the wrong item. I’m absolutely not saying I expected or wanted to keep the wrong item, but to be made to feel like I’m in the wrong at a fault of this company’s is in my opinion unacceptable. To top it off, the item is now out of stock and they can’t tell me when it will be back. I will NEVER purchase with them again.

You have now replied to my complaint saying you have been in touch (with a copied and pasted response that you’ve sent to every other complaint on here) YOU HAVE NOT TRIED TO CONTACT ME - YOU ARE LYING TO YOUR CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!"
153830,"I found the product I needed super easy and even got advice about the install.
Only negative is the ex VAT pricing. I would expect that most people pay VAT so why not show it at the outset.
Those who can reclaim VAT will know how to do that."
190659,"I purchased a £150 of keyboard for my son. Unfortunately it was the wrong one. They took 7 days for the goods to land by which time I was in hospital having surgery. When I contacted them within the 30 day returns period they told me ..""no it's only 14 days for unwanted goods"". I explained I had had surgery and been in hospital and asked for some help...their answer?...""tough turkey"".

Nice to see customers, customer service and basic human compassion is this high on their priority list. Won't be buying from these guys again.

196537,"I ordered my pc on 1st of December using the automated process to build my PC as I was unsure about specifications, ram CPU graphics motherboard. So I was very pleased how it worked. You tell them what kind of pc your looking for it give a basic build of that system and the you can tweak it to your hearts content then once you have the PC you want you simply sit back be patient. I received my build on time as was specified and the build quality is great. If you are in the market for a pc I recommend PC specialist unreservedly."
101972,"Cancelled our iPhone contract orders two weeks later with zero explanation, and after a hard credit search being conducted. They have also gone against their own T&C’s cancelling after the orders had been accepted.

Customer service have no intention to help or respond to complaints or queries, only false promises of returned calls from a manager.

Will be avoiding using Currys for any future purposes after being treated like this."
160065,The buyabattery team did an excellent job on the batteries I needed. They are excellent value and were delivered quickly. It was a good experience I will use them again in the future.
113552,"Would love to see if I receive another 'thanks for your feedback, get in touch if you have further issues' comment on here!
I've been trying to get in touch for over 12 hours over the past 2 days!
Including being made to go to a store during the pandemic, despite currys 'putting the safety of their staff and customers first'!
This resulted in the same outcome - absolutely no help.
Then, I am told to call up to make a complaint, after another hour on the phone I'm suddenly told complaints can only be handled via email! I email the address provided and guess what... failed to deliver!
So I use the curry's online chat service to ask for the appropriate email, just to be told one doesn't exist! Need to call up again!
So for my 2320394 time, I call up, just to be told no one can assist me.
Still waiting for a reply on the social medias as so far I've just been palmed off with the classic 'sorry for your inconvenience'.
If you're sorry, how about compensate me for the absolute waste of money you have conned me out of with the 'care' plan, which is anything but!
My family were in the middle of redecorating the house etc, so glad we saw this awful service in time as well as all the other bad reviews so we don't make the mistake of buying all of our kitchen appliances from this hell hole too!"
102192,"I purchased an extended warranty with my tumble dryer, I contacted team knowhow when I needed a repair.

194675,Great price and great service. Many thanks
162780,Have had two lots of birthday invites recently. I found them easy to use. The designs are many I was very happy for the choice. Then the personalisation was easy too.

189194,Ordered Hairdryer ..19th Dec with next day delivery . Sent via Evri and from getting to depot the tracking stayed static! I rang and wax over 2 hrs in queue. So many E mails to be told to just keep checking! Needless to say no delivery of Xmas gift. Phoned after and apparently phone lines down! Emailed promised a reorder and free gift ( after numerous emails) on Thursday 29 th. No confirmation and phoned today to be told hadn’t been reordered ! So many excuses and not expected from a big company like this. Very disappointed customer

162655,"2 weeks ago spent several hours trying to contact knowhow to get my oven valeted which is part of my care plan which I pay for each month.
After finally getting through to the cancalations department they talked me round in not cancelling and stated the valet company would call me within 7 days to arrange a date for my oven to be valeted.
You guessed it 2 weeks later and no one contacting me, same again several hours and end up at the cancellation department who inform me the valet company is a third party and I need to contact them but the operator does not know the contact number or name of the company, you could not make this up.
When I asked to speak to a supervisor was told none available. When I asked if my monthly gets paid into knowhow or the unnamed company and was told knowhow but not there problem which is mine.
When I took the plan out I forgot to ask about the crystal ball I would need to find out who the company which carry out the work is called and the contact number.

DO NOT TAKE A PLAN OUT WITH KNOWHOW, THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY"

I've dropped one star because the security features (e.g. secure boot) weren't turned on in UEFI and had to be done manually. I would prefer security by design, especially as this is now required for Win 11."
109661,Easy to do and got exactly what I was quoted
172796,"The build time and delivery was slower than I had hoped for. PC Specialist did keep me up to date with my order throughout the process though. The website was easy to navigate and easy to find what I was looking for.

The computer has developed an annoying issue, but this may have nothing to do with PC Specialist as it wasn't a problem when first delivered."

136032,"Having just had a series of cockups trying to move to Digital Voice (beware everyone, they use this to tuck you up with other charges), I thought I'd look see how they rate on Trustpilot and was not surprised. A near-monopoly without the competence to engineer risk free processes."
194093,"Honestly wouldn’t bother selling here again. I had my phone diagnostically tested and checked professionally before selling to them, as it was in perfect working condition and I was cautious of any issues given the value of the phone.

I received an offer from £500 down to £175 for a speaker issues and scratches. I have photographic and diagnostic evidence prior to sending this to them, that there were no defects. I’ve now been advised it will be 3-5 days to return the item to me, and this will not cover up to the £500 postage value.

I will sell this privately, or go o2. It’s quite clear that there’s no issues with the phone and they try to just pay you less."

The UI is horrible to navigate and adverts on a £34 a month (sports only) subscription, seriously. The £10 one month offer is bearable for 3 F1 races, but i won't be renewing."
127620,"They have a get hired guarantee. Or, so they say. But it's not - it's a ""you get to try again, but if our leads suck you don't actually have a guarantee."" At least for photographers, just stay away. I complained to their customer service team, but all I got was a statement that said:

""We do not guarantee work, but provide a platform that on average garners professionals a 1 in 5 conversion rate - providing them with an excellent return on investment. We do not charge commission and so do not take any earnings from you, nor do we take any earnings from repeat business you may win.""

I don't speak on behalf of any other industry/line of work, but for photographers, it's a false promise."

177749,"AWFUL company with terrible customer service. My first order with Studio and most definately will be my last. My item has been stuck with the delivery company for over a week, I have been querying with Studio who have told me they have contacted Evri and will respond within 24-48 hours (they havent) it has been over 7 days since I placed the order so I called again (fifth time) and asked them to cancel and refund me, as the item would be too late. Studio's response is that they will investigate the 'lost parcel' and I should wait up to 30 days before I get a refund. Absolute violation of Trading Standard Laws and the Consuner Rights Act. The parcel, until it reaches me is the retailers responsibility, therefore any dispute or investigation between Studio and Evri should have no impact on me receiving my refund. I have never experienced anything like this in all my life from a supposedly reputable company!

Update.. although a generic response has been posted to appear as though customer services are trying to help resolve this, what they havent told you is that I called in my half hour lunch break and spent the entire time on the phone, as well as again at the end of the day and replying to emails sent to me also. All responses are the same. The parcel is very obviously lost but I should allow Studio to investigate with Evri before I get a refund! Shocking. Another well know high street company I have just dealt with, sent a replacement next day when I queried my lost item, not only that, issued me a discount code for future use! As I said, my first and will be my last dealings with studio. Im reporting to Trading Standards as the item is not my responsibility until I receive it therefore Studio have no right to withhold my funds whilst they investigate. Appalling."

182806,"I purchased a couple of Adata SSD's back in June, one for a linux mac mini, which has not been used since & the other was for a PC build for a client.
Initially the SSD was working great in the newly built PC, windows literally installed within minutes.
The day my client finally came to collect the computer, it blue screened whilst he was checking it out & failed to restart due to no startup disk. The Adata SSD had totally died & I felt totally embarrassed.

Arranging the return & replacement with eBuyer was hassle free & could not have gone smoother. In no time at all the PC was back up and running, but I can't help wondering for how long.
It appears that my experience with the Adata su630 SSD's is not an isolated one, but fairly common. I will be avoiding that particular model in the future.

The quality of service from EBuyer is always second to none, 5 stars every time."

Good job I have the mobile but not everyone has my number."

I've lost count of the amount of chats I've had today and so far got nowhere. Last message I sent on the chat was over 2 hours ago and I've had no reply. This isn't filling me with confidence. No idea what's happening, probably better just going to another provider.*Update. Finally chatted with someone who changed my appointment."

We have a problem with our NowTV stick (plug into TV’s HDMI port) not working.
I have since contacted NowTV numerous times with no reply.
After two months, I decided to write a complaint to them describing the issue. The complaints procedure states that they will aim to reply within 24 hours...6 days later and still no reply. Paying for a service that I can’t even use and there is no customer service.
I would avoid using NowTV at all costs as they clearly do not care about customer satisfaction.
I’ve never known such poor service."
145623,"An item was ordered on 16th December with an expected delivery date on the 19th which I had an email confirmation for. The item was not delivered and so when I phoned on the 20th, the original order was cancelled as they believed it was lost in the warehouse and re-ordered on the same day which I was “guaranteed” would be delivered on Wednesday and that the customer service person would be telephoning me to confirm the expected delivery time. Again I waited in and yet again it was not delivered and no phone call. I then had the inconvenience of having to go into a busy store to purchase the item from another company which wasted a lot of time and was a very large item to have to go and collect. I then cancelled the order with you (which still hadn’t arrived) on 23rd December. Then to add insult further I received a text message this last week to advise that my order was being delivered which I had to chase around to the courier to cancel. A further issue was that my account still showed the delivery charge as being outstanding which I’ve had to call up again to rectify. I’ve been left totally unsatisfied at the poor service as well as losing out on the discount offer that was being offered. The customer service staff do not seem bothered by my complaints and did not escalate the issue further when this was requested. This has not been the first delivery issue that I have experienced with yourselves either."

It was missing an item that Appliances Direct advertised as included in the box.

Appliances Direct refused to take responsbility and kept fobbing me off.

192701,"Appalling service. I had the free pass for a week, they tried to take the payment of £7.99 at the last day by surprise but luckily my card provider declined ""suspicious transaction"" (lol). Seeing this awful practice I tried to close my account. I spent 2 days trying to figure out how to close my account, there is no option on their webpage. There is also no option to remove your card details, name and address from their database, which is in breach of GDPR and illegal in Europe. In the end I had to change my card details to a randomly generated one and address to some random company in London. They should be sued for for breaching ""right to be forgotten"" law (not sure how it works outside Europe though).

No network service most of the time when it works it's only in certain areas of the country nextdoor to a mast.
Three nothing but a con, should have their license revoked after being a customer for a number of years worst customer service in the world.
In my opinion, but before you buy check out other reviews.
Bad network Mumbai based customer services, no UK customer services at all.

198767,"Awful - I’ve been waiting almost a month to get my new broadband set up, get a message to say my broadband box has been delivered - not to my address , and it turns out Bt have registered my account and processed an order for a different address to mine despite checking it multiple times with me over the phone on order - so my data protection gdpr has been breached sending my details to other addresses, I have also been told my start date for going live in a few days now won’t happen and the order will be cancelled very very unhappy - don’t use these incompetent morons - absolute cowboys"
152309,"We booked delivery 3 days in advance and we had a text, NO delivery and no communucation from Hugh's untill I contacted them, then they could not tell me if the TV would arrive that day.
I contacted them later in the day and they confirmed at 4:30pm that the TV would not be arriving that day and could be booked for a deliver 5 days away.

I canceled my order and went with Ao.com who dilivered ontime."
170883,"Firstly, happy with the TV aspect which is contract free and via dongle. NOT HAPPY with Broadband/phone service - lost telephone number due to being 'cancelled out'. Number belonged to 84 year old dad who has had the number for roughly 40 years and all those who need to know it, know it. Not been able to retrieve it and the customer service experience is dire. So both dad and I have taken our business to BT (who I might add desperately tried to retrieve dad's number but coulnd't be done)."

Can't ask for more!"
171266,"They claim to offer a fast service, it was a week before I received the pack to send my devices off. I sent them special delivery so I knew they’d had my devices for a week so I contacted them via email to which they said they hadn’t received them. I ended up having to call them to get clarification that they’d actually received them. After another week passed I contacted them again as I still hadn’t heard anything and they finally made me and offer. They reduced the offer on both devices saying the wrong models were sent. I sold them 2 64gb iPhone 11s and they said they received 2 64gb iPhone 11s, so I’ve no idea what they mean with that. They also claim there is an issue with the speaker on one of the phones, which just simply isn’t true. They basically lure you in with good offers, take far too long to process your items so that by the time you receive an offer you’re so frustrated you just accept them to put an end to the whole saga. This company should be avoided."

185692,"I have an essentials fridge freezer 8years old. Unfortunately over time the freezer draws have broken, water/gel under salad drawer, over freezes and milk holder have broken. I have paid £2pm over the 8years. I went in store to buy a new fridge freezer and was told that as I had been paying the warranty for the 8years that if they couldn't replace the parts I would get a like for like fridge freezer. Yesterday whilst working and my daughter was at mine an engineer looked over the fridge freezer. He contacted another engineer and I have been informed no spare parts and I am not allowed a like for like. I am livid after spending our nearly £190 over 8years!"

109484,"I have spent hours trying to get the correct tariff/agreed package price applied to my account and this has (I believe) now been applied to the account. Appointments agreed and unattended, promises made and not kept - it’s not been good. On and off, ever since I went with Virgin for the first time, I have been trying to get a pair of extenders as the speed of the WiFi is good but it doesn’t cover the whole house. I still haven’t got them. The latest explanation I was given as to why this wasn’t possible is that I had to wait until the new tariff had been applied before I could get them although I fail to see how the two things are linked. Would it be possible to get this done?"
120245,The worst company ever for 2 months 4 Different inginers 100 phone calls and my broadband still not working I don't know what else to do only continue paying for something that I don't have and paying extra for mobile data thank you for the service Virginia.

I almost can’t believe it and am really chuffed! Thank you. And to previous reviewers who made me think it might be alright."
199441,Because of the lack of knowledge of store staff the hob was not able to be installed even though I explained the existing hob did not have a suitable installation socket but there was one 2 metres away . But the installation engineer said he wouldn’t be able to do this after paying for installation and disposal
131994,"Installing virgin media went well the engineer who came was great. Really friendly and polite chap. The issues came when I tried to chase up my volt benefits. My speed was doubled but they added another £20 to my monthly bill. After 5 calls over almost two months my contract is still not correct and I still owe Virgin the bizarre amount of £4.33 in the app but according to the call center I don't owe anything! Who knows!

Edit: I am now being overcharged despite numerous calls to virgin media. Absolutely useless."

188622,I ordered a Nintendo switch bundle which I had to wait 2 days to be delivered to store . No email confirmation then I went to the store and was told to wait another day . Got home same day email confirmation arrived at 4.30 half an hour after I had left the store . Went back Monday only 2/3 items had arrived annoying as it was a present . I told the managerhe didn’t seem concerned and even thought it was funny . He rang customer service who did a lost in transit form I now have to wait 7-14 days for the game for my switch so it’s useless . I rang customer service they were no help and told me I have to wait for a manager to call me . Waited 24 hours no call so I called again they told me to wait longer. I am infuriated with the awful customer service that I have received and have paid £350 for a switch that I can’t do anything with . Absolute joke won’t be shopping there again
162472,"Just all around a bit rubbish. Where to begin. The apps are poorly designed and not very user friendly. You can't hide things you don't want to see (or don't pay for) so despite having no interest in sport or reality TV both those sections remain cluttering up the interface. In the latest update to the Apple TV app there is still no 5.1 audio despite charging extra for the ""boost"" plugin. And as an added bonus it doesn't respond well to the remote control, the fast forward / rewind controls are terrible, only allowing you to select the multiplier of moving forwards / back once you can navigate to the buttons - the nice progress bar isn't actually something you can use to move back and forth in a video unlike every other streaming app I've used. On the iPad the apps still don't recognise any controls on either my Airpods or B&W headphones and if you pause playback for long enough it then won't resume and you have to drop back to the interface and reselect the programme, hoping it'll resume where it dropped off.

Oh and if you want TV and films you'll be spending at least twice as much as other providers charge. All in all it does a good job of being replicating the Sky experience, leaving you feeling somewhat disheartened that you've paid good money for such a shoddy service. Avoid unless like me there are certain shows you want to watch and can only find here, but don't expect it to be a positive experience!"
133843,Excellent service and Excellent site.Thanks Mr Memory ;)

131306,"I paid for NowTV fibre on the 24th of June, had an engineer visit booked for the 8th of July. I still hadn't received the hub on the 4th of July, I had rang the help centre twice and both employees misinformed me and told me that my hub was on it's way, which it wasn't. I still hadn't received the hub by the 4th like I'd been told so I rang again and was told my order had been cancelled, given no explanation as to why or any help in resolving it. I asked if a hub could be sent via next day delivery so it would get to me in time for the engineer visit and was told that's not something they do, even though the issues were on NowTV's end. I was spoken to rudely by the employee down the phone, who had no real interest in helping me, which is confusing as his whole disappointing career is to help people over the phone, surely? Following from this ordeal I asked to be refunded the initial £24.99 set up fee , which the employee scoffed at and tried to make me feel bad for asking for it. `from now I'll make sure to steer clear of all products and services by yourselves, and will encourage others to do the same."

I've tried to contact them several times to explain them i don't want the phone anymore and that i want a refund, however i get an automated reply saying they are trying hard to dispatch my item but can not give me an exact date when that will be...seriously??? And the live chat on their website, 30 minutes waiting for someone to talk to about my complaint and never gotten a reply. Very bad and disapointing experience. Not recomended."

114861,"I have been a BT phone, broadband and TV customer for a number of years. Contract is up for renewal and BT kindly send me their latest offers all of which cost more than existing package and all of which cost substantially more than those available to new customers. I rang up to discuss a new deal and basically got told how lucky I was to be with BT cause they were so good and that if I wanted to leave that was fine. So the conclusion seem to be if you are an existing customer you will be charged well over the odds and they don't care if you leave. Strange business model but there you are. Don't bother will the we are really sorry reply to this and contact us via twitter or Facebook cause I have been ignored there as well."
110991,"I sent these guys my mobile phone, an they've had it for over 2 weeks an still not paid me. I have contacted them numerous times, with no response. I have messaged them saying pay me or send me my phone back. They have blatantly ignored me, an answered other people instead. I'm a vulnerable person an they've been told this, but still they're not contacting me back. I am still paying for the phone, until i can pay it off with the money i was supposedly meant to get off them. I'm recently unemployed due to the virus situation, i have shared all this info with them numerous times, yet i'm still being ignored. I have no other option now but to either seek legal action or contact the paper, which is more stress for me. But at least then i can share my experience with other people, as to how they treat vulnerable people that have mental health issues. I will never deal with this company again."

GHD blame the customer and do NOT offer refunds for a consistently faulty product, only replacements. I have my doubts as to whether these are new or repaired returns.

Do not waste your money - buy Cloud 9 or Dyson instead if you wish to have a pleasant customer service experience. I was considering claiming through the disputes tribunal. However with a narcissistic company like this, that chooses combat over kind customer care, it's not worth my energy engaging with them."

195244,"My husband purchased a Samsung phone in December for me which was faulty. I contacted Carphone Warehouse, which by the way took 4 hours, and I arranged a collection and a refund. I was assured that the refund would take 3 to 5 days. I received an email from Carphone Warehouse on 5th January confirming receipt of the phone but still no refund. I was told today that a cheque was raised on the 7th January and it could take at least 2 weeks. At the moment most of the UK is in lockdown. Many people are either shielding or isolating and banks (if open) have long queues. Who in this day and age refunds with a cheque (other than the Inland Revenue) when you have paid by debit card?! Are Carphone Warehouse going bust? Absolutely disgraceful and shoddy run company!!!"

164919,"TERRIBLE customer 'service' over a 5-day period.

I contacted Virgin Media (VM) to arrange a package transfer to a new property. Things appeared to go well, and the call ended. The next morning, I received email confirmation that a second direct debit mandate (DDM) had been set up, which I found unnecessary & more pertinent, intrusive.

I did not discuss setting up a second DDM.

VM claims to want to make the moving process as stress-free as possible, yet out of every service provider I have dealt with in connection with my move, VM has, by faaaaaaaaar, being the most aggravating.

With services being available in my new home, this should have been relatively straight forward, but not with VM. Every call I have made to VM has been handled by a different rep, none of whom seemed to understand what it was they were supposed to be doing, but all of whom did promise things that have yet to materialise.

Come on VM, I have been a customer for over 2 years. What is the problem? Can you get it right just this once?

Awful, awful, awful!

********
UPDATE
********

Before I was due to move home, I contacted VM on several occasions because I wanted to make certain that my package would be up & running when I move in. I was assured & re-assured by VM that my package would be ready. On the day I moved, I received a text message with a link to activate my account. I clicked the link, waited the suggested 20 minutes & received a further text identifying a problem and providing a number to call.

Before I called, I searched every room, looking for the central point to which I needed to attached the cable. There is no VM box. There is, however, a BT box. I am now wondering whether VM knew this & sought to poach BT's business... after the month I have had, anything is possible.

So, here I am. My second day in my new home with no WIFI. I am having to tether my devices to my phone (thank you GiffGaff) via a Hotspot, which is chewing through my data like there's no tomorrow.

This is wholly unacceptable VM! I have been misled & lied to by your 'advisors' on multiple occasions. This has left me not only out of pocket, re my phone data, but out of pocket in the sense that I am unable to earn a living.

It may have escaped your attention VM, but we are in a recession & the cost of living is going through the roof. How are customers meant to survive when VM's prime directive is to keep the cash flowing in, regardless?



Your business model is clearly broken."
124794,The phone came with a good condition and on time
125534,Water dispenser on fridge leaked within a few days. 10 days later still waiting for an engineer visit with parts to fix problem. Your after sales call management system is awful with far too many menu options and repetition of the same information requested. Not a happy customer
169111,"I've had terrible issues with BT in the past (for business), decided to try again with FTTP. Placed the order, all appeared well. Before I had even agreed terms, they sent an email saying engineer will arrive within 2 days. I immediately contacted them to advise I need to install a duct from the road to the front of the property as it's blocked so don't send the engineer. They sent the engineer who has delayed the order due to.... no duct between the property and the road as it was blocked!. The duct is now installed yet they say the order has gone into delay.

They keep phoning every two days to say the order is being progressed but they have to send a team out to dig (I'm assuming they haven't listened about the duct).

They have until the 25th of this month or I am cancelling. When I gave them the order deadline for install they said it'll be in by 1st March. Too late, if it is not in by the 25th then you lose the business.

Seems they are worse now than before which is saying something!


UPDATE: 25th February 2022.

Have been chasing BT for a month for updates, they keep stalling. They have now sent a phone for the cloud voice service (unsolicited). FTTP is still not installed, delays delays delays. Just cancelled the order.

If you value your peace of mind and sanity, avoid BT at all costs, they are terrible, can't even install a FTTP!!!!

Update 26/2/2022. Openreach have now been out and resolved the block duct issue in the road, bit late now though, order cancelled.

Terrible service from BT, you lost the business now, I've renewed with Virgin who were no trouble at all and negotiated a cheaper deal with ease. I'm very happy with Virgin so will stay with them."

167237,"I have used Mazuma Mobile many times over the years, and have never had an issue, however this experience was a little disappointing.

I posted my mobile and smart watch to them on a Friday, Royal Mail confirmed they had received them around 8:30 in the morning the following Tuesday. I had 1 email from Mazuma to confirm the watch was received at 10:21 and 1 email from Mazuma at 11:36 to confirm the mobile was received, both on the same day as Royal Mail confirmed delivery. As Mazuma confirmed both devices were received before mid-day I expected payment that afternoon, as Mazuma advertises ""Mazuma will make payment on the very same day* they receive your mobile!"" - providing the devices are received before 2pm Mon-Fri.

However, payment was not made until the Thursday - over 48 hours after the devices where received.

I had contacted Mazuma on the Wednesday to check progress, however, they replied on the Thursday ""I can see that we received your device yesterday, it will currently be in a queue to be assessed and then payment will be made."" Firstly, the devices were received on the Tuesday, not the Wednesday, and the reply came after full payment had been processed - which led me to believe they didn't even check the orders in question.

Overall, Mazuma did not meet it's advertised promise, and the customer support didn't fill me with confidence.

Knocked the score down to 1 as Mazuma’s reply has nothing to do with my feedback, which adds to my point that Mazuma’s customer service is poor."

They apologised and asked if it was ok or would I require the original part. I wasn’t bothered by this, they were still able to build the pc in time, and had the pc delivered to me on Christmas Eve. 👌
My son loves it, it’s his first one having only had consoles previously.

I would 100% recommend PC Specialist to anyone looking for a bespoke PC."

140982,Ordered a lens cap (I think). Once I had paid for it a box appeared on the right side telling me there was a problem and to pay again! I didn't bother and decided to wait for an email just in case I ended up paying twice. 10 minutes later the fraud team phoned from my bank listing suspicious activity. Gladly there was none and the problem of it not going through properly must have done that. Nothing wrong my end - there was plenty in my account. Never again.

197982,"Explain why it's taking this long for a company to refund several amounts of people. Clearly all they seem to do for their explanation is write ""sorry about this, don't hesitate to contact us via...."" and then put down their email which I HAVE DONE but got no response. I expected my refund today and I have no refund. I will contact my bank to get through for this and I don't recommend them at all. It takes additional services such as court and the banks to get then to fix up."
149568,"Don't go near Virgin Media, the worst company I've ever had the misfortune to deal with.
They provide an appalling service and as for the customer service, they couldn't do worse if they tried.
Criminally expensive too, if you live in London Community Fibre is 1/3 of the price for better speeds up and down and Rolls Royce customer service.
I was with Virgin for over 20 years (as no one else provided fiber to the router). Their parting gift to me was to steal another month's subscription despite my canceling my contract the previous month.
Well rid of them, all my neighbors are moving to Community Fiber."

169300,"My internet went down last Tuesday 10.01.23. Workmen came to my street and changed a telephone pole. They put all cables down, changed the pole and put cables back up again. During this whole process, my internet went down and never came back. My boyfriend (billpayer) has been calling TalkTalk since then, no solution has been given and we are still with no internet. We have spent countless hours on the phone with their customer service going in circles. A new router has been sent even when we explained that was not the problem (and it wasn't), then 2 hours on the phone doing tests making sure we had no internet (why are we going to call them saying we don't have internet if we do, nobody will want to go through that experience). Finally, after many more hours on the phone, they have decided they had to escalate the case to the their Technical Support Team. This team was supposed to call us today 16.01.23. No call from them today at all but, when we got in touch with TalkTalk, they said they had called us when obviously they did not (also having to deal with their lies). Now the call is scheduled for tomorrow. Who knows if they will bother to call us tomorrow to sort the issue which is really simple. An engineer has to come out and sort it out this end. There are more people affected by the same problem on our street and they have sent engineers to sort out the problem for those people. I work from home and I need the internet to do so, tomorrow it will be a week since it went down and we are no near to sort out the problem. It is utterly frustrating the way they do not care for their customers and are happy to follow their long processes without bothering to find the best and fastest solution for their customers. They are been paid for a service they are not providing in this case and they don't seem bothered at all to keep this service up and running again as quickly as possible. Customer service team acts like machines following a script with no solutions to the issues they have to deal with. I would not recommend TalkTalk at all to anybody after our experience and I think we are left with no other option that looking for another provider as our experience has been totally horrendous."
166866,"Awful experience , customer service non existent , no phone number , just horrendous .!!!!!

Please have them check the 1000’s of emails I have sent from the email address that is attached to my account .

152007,"Ordered new broadband package 25/11/22.Initial installation date was 14/12/22. Engineers arrived early December to carry out external works to property. Installation date was then pushed back to 29/12/22 and then again to the 21/01/23. Less than 24 hours before engineer was due to visit I received an email saying installation would be delayed further to 07/02/23. I raised a complaint on 20/01/23 about the shocking service and the fact we have been left without broadband and received an email from Virgin's Resolution team on 23/01/23 at lunchtime. The email said that installation would be done that day (23/01/23) and to contact the preinstallation team to discuss. Rang the preinstallation team only to be told that installation would not be carried out until 07/02/23, the delay they explained was due to external works needing to be carried out. I advised them that the external works had already been carried out, that I'm sick of having installation delayed again and again and to cancel my order. The person on the other end kept putting me on hold and disconnected the call twice. When I asked about my initial contract and cancelling it I was told they couldn't put me through to the correct team and asked me what I wanted them to do!?!.

Eventually managed to cancel the order after submitting another complaint and ringing around their call centres. Was passed from pillar to post and spoke to 3 different staff members before someone actually cancelled the order.
If you are thinking of taking out a broadband package with Virgin take my advice and look elsewhere. I've never dealt with such an incompetent and unprofessional company who blatantly lie to you. They use delay tactics when you try and contact them, such as sending you around various departments, putting you on hold numerous times during the call for no reason whatsoever, and even disconnecting your call to deter you from proceeding any further. AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
169915,Lovely photos which arrived just in time for Christmas!
149236,I love Studio. Their prices are very good and the products they sell are great. I am always ordering different items which I need and they arrive in good time and the fact they are delivered by courier helps me very much as I am disabled. Out of all clubbooks Studio is the best.
123314,Absolutely abysmal customer service when things go wrong. My ex-wife bought me a Nokia 1 Plus last May and it failed to charge up just before Christmas. The staff in the shop refused to change it or have it repaired as my wife was the purchaser and I cannot contact her as I don't know where she lives now. I also wanted to change from ID (another Carphone Warehouse company) to EE and again the staff in the Penzance store were extremely unhelpful and couldn't give a damn. I got in touch with Nokia who sent me a prepaid label to return it free of charge for repairs and had to buy a secondhand phone elsewhere as a stop-gap. AVOID CARPHONE WAREHOUSE AT ALL COST AS THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T CARE IF ANY FAULTS ARISE.
108111,I am very happy with your service at the moment after 6 months. I have no complaints
115610,"Ripped off 14 year old.
I set up an account for my daughter so she could try NOW tv in her room on a free 7 day trial - cancelled at the end of 7days as the streaming was so poor and intermittent , but guess what, charged her £20 stating it was no cancelled in time even though after contacting them they have confirmed it was cancelled on the 7th day. Daughter wanted the experience of online purchases so she entered her own Debit card details (early lesson learnt). Now TV refusing to refund her, so have escalated complaint via Ombudsman. -its only £20 for gods sake but its the upset it has caused her. Multi million pound company and no customer service, cannot even get to speak to someone, all has to be by chat or email. -NEVER again will l use them"
173992,"I have had issues with this internet since day 1. Keeps dropping. Engineers have been and gone but issue still not resolved. Spoke to the team previously and asked if it can't be resolved, could I cancel and move provider...sadly it was no. So I'm stuck with an internet which is terrible to use especially as I work from home. I sometimes have to use my mobile data as WiFi hotspot to join my teams meetings. This is just ridiculous but as I unable to pay an exit fee and leave, sadly I have to sit here and count down the days."

This is a joke, I spend more time manually draining the machine then the load should take it total. I work in a nursing home and it's been tough during covid to then come home off an exhausting and sometimes upsetting shift only to then sit on the floor manually draining the machine just to get my uniform clean.

109242,Ordered a sofa on 3/11 still haven't received it. The said they could reorder it on the 6/12 without any fees as they can deduct it from the refund I am due as my order has been lost (how you can lose a sofa I don't know) They haven't issued the refund and said they will not complete order until payment is made which isn't what I initially was told. Requested a call back 2 weeks ago. I am a business woman so my phone is always close by they haven't called back once and the complaints team don't respond. Below on this comment I want you to record the time you called rather than say we attempted to call Because you don't attempt

100677,Quick efficient delivery. Well done 👍
194009,If i could give it a minus i would. Just dont waste your time buying from them. I purchased a phone from carphone warehouse. Got the delivery yesterday and the phone itself was missing from the box!!! I tried contacting them through calls and emails. Spent hours on the phone but no one received the call or responded to my emails. Took the package to the local currys and was told they couldnt do anything and i would just have to keep trying the number. Its just a scam. Now i have to raise a dispute through my bank. Just a waste of time and really unhelpful service. I honestly wish i had checked these reviews beforehand. Never trusting them again.
177533,Avoid like the coronavirus. I have probably spent close to 5 hours on the phone to get a repair booked for a washing machine. Nobody has been able to put me in touch with the right person.all that happens is I get told to phone a different number (which has been tried many times before) they really don't appear to know how to help. Beginning to resent every single penny spent in a plan that I've been unable to use when I need it
128667,"First purchase from AO after bad experience with another retailer. Easy purchase, phone call to follow up on purchase, check delivery etc. received a text and email on day of delivery could even track the driver. Even received a call and hour before.

I suggest you use another delivery company."

How has now. TV got my bank details!!!this company should be shut down!!! Asap
111106,Absolutely retarted company. First they slowed my network coverage. Then they said its because you need to upgrade your handset so I did. Still same issues. Calls cut of all the time. 1 day I have Internet and the next no Internet. If you can't offer 6g then don't offer it. Absolutely slow as anything. Nearly lost my job because of these guys as I use the phone for work and rely on the data. Many times I had to leave work cause I had no Internet. Please guys stay away. Nothing but scammers
134267,"Lowest price for Shure Aonic3 earphones online
Had to wait for a couple of months.
Was lucky that one day I checked stock levels, one was available.
Was dispatched within 2 hours of placing order"
177595,"Extremely poor network coverage. I have complained and complained. Nothing to do with my phone and everything to do with a cell site being down slightly further away from my most local one. This causes over-subscription issues at my local cell site.

Vodafone's lack of understanding of mobile network architecture is startling. They have simply offered me the option of leaving my contract and not resolved the issues. I stayed loyal however until...

I called an American Landline number and for 3 minutes on hold, I was charged £9.00 before the call was cut off.

This charge is wholly unfair, particularly since Vodafone are extremely unlikely to be charged anywhere near this as Vodafone also operates stateside. This would be nothing more than a local termination (I.e. calling as if you are Stateside) for Vodafone.

I have asked for a refund for the call and Vodafone have refused. I asked for my PAC code and to make a formal complaint and online chat have made this as difficult as possible.

I don't particularly appreciate my calls to customer services being transferred overseas to what appears to be outsourced customer services with little understanding of customers or mobile networks and with obvious language barriers.

I'm afraid I do not recommend Vodafone any longer although I have cared for the company for a long time, I have experienced issues every time I have been with Vodafone over the last 15 years, particularly with poor customer services and low bandwidth.

Furthermore the Very Me awards do not detail anyone I shop with and I never win anything on the prize competitions."
110284,Unreliableroo. Slow delivery (double the estimated time). And dangerous riders without lights (general observation)
198512,"I had ordered a Iphone 8 and decided that I didn't want it anymore. I had then emailed them and sent it back to them the same day. Once they had received it they said that I would get my refunded money within 12-14 days. I still hadn't received my refund by that time period. So I emailed again and this time they said that I would receive it before or on the 11th of February. It is now the 13th of February and I haven't received my refund.
I would not recommend buying anything from this company as they are not replying to any of my emails and I shall be taking legal action against the company.
This is absolutely disgusting behaviour from both the customer service team and the company itself."
194281,"Never purchase a PC or laptop from them!

I bought a HP laptop from you in April 2018 which was faulty and continually crashed, so I returned it and was replaced with the same product. This happened again and I then decided to switch to another product which was a Lenovo Laptop. I have since this time had the ongoing problems.

I use the laptop for work and often have to travel for months on end and it is has been an ongoing problem which I have attempted to fix while away with your phone support to teams by doing bios updates and even reinstalling windows on several occassions. Over this time I had the warranty as well as a paid for care plan. Towards the end of my care plan in May this year I called and explained the issues and handed the laptop in for repairs, since then I have had nothing but further issues.

The first repair came back and they had done exactly what I had done multiple times myself when on the call. The problems carried on and it continually crashed to a blue screen as it has done for months. I explained the issues multiple times to your team and the people in store who stated this was a hard drive issue and the updates and reinstall of windows would not fix the problem. Even though this is what your repair time did again!

I then had no choice but to take the laptop away for work again over June and July. I made sure I informed the support team that I will be returning the product for a proper repair after this time and they agreed. I then went into the store when I got back to hand it in again for another repair and explained in detail what the issues were.

Again it came back with the repair sheet saying they did exactly the same stuff! Just reinstalled windows and bios updates. This time they didn't even install the latest updates. As soon as I started using the laptop again it crashed again and again! I was actually told by your customer service team in the store that this is what you do reguarly:
You badly repair products until peoples warranties/ care plans run out so you are stuck with a faulty product and have to replace it. Firstly to have your staff telling customers this is a disgrace! And secondly if it is true, surely this is completely unethical!!

After this I called again and went through the whole process again and tried to do the latest updates myself, but they failed and windows stated they do not support the latest updates on the hardware on the PC.

I then spoke to Manager in the customer are team called Lisa who said she would take this on personally for me as it is honestly a complete joke that I am still going through this! Lisa assured me last Wednesday when we spoke that she will get it all sorted. I was then told to take the laptop back to the store again, this is now around 5th time I have had to visit the store which is almost an hour out of my journey each time.

When I got into the store on Thursday morning, I was told that the system was down then so I would have to come back another time. I was not prepared to do this and the lady behind the counter then refused to deal with me as I was clearly frustrated! As you can imagine as this has been dragging on for multiple months!!!! All I had asked is that she signed the laptop in and when the system came back on added it to the system. She said this was not possible and I would need to come back.

She then ignored me and started serving other customers so I eventually got a manager to assist me who said this was no problem at all. His name was Max Moram and stated there was no issue with doing this at all. So I wrote down all my details, gave them. He and I both signed a sheet of paper that stated the time and date plus the items details on Thursday at 9:26am. I then left and was told I would get a text once it had been booked in correctly.

I have still not received any message or text now and it has been almost a week. I then called the support team yesterday to try to speak to Lisa who had postively assured me she would help and make sure this is all sorted.

I spent 30 minutes on the phone yesterday and the guy on the phone confirmed they had not received the laptop or there was not a record of it there side at this point. So the likelihood is that my laptop is sat in the store in Brixton with Max having forgotten what he was supposed to do with it or not even bothered to do anything about.

After 30 minutes on the phone yesterday the guy helping me said he would make sure that a manager ideally Lisa called me back yesterday once he had a chance to speak to the store to find out where the laptop is. I have now still not received a call back with any updates or details.

I am now so over these issues and refuse to take this laptop back or go through your systems or procedures any further. It has been a stressfull, mess of a process and the only outcome I will now accept is a full refund.

I will only accept that a manager responds to deal with this issue now that is able to approve the above. I refuse to accept another product from your company or have anything to do with you ever again!

This has gone on long enough and I can no longer handle dealing with your teams that are unhelpful, rude or not able to even repair a product that all it probably needed was a new hard drive or similar. This is beyond an issue now and will be taking it further unless it is dealt and a resolution is sorted within the next 24hrs!"

181995,"Excellent service from the AO engineer and delivery updates were great, quick and easy."
106883,"Customer service is absolutely appalling and when you make a complaint the customer service representatives are bordering on rude. Wouldn’t mind but only trying to move a number from one Vodafone contract to another Vodafone contract. Hours lost on the phone, the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing. Such an inefficient organisation. If we had known it would have been so hard would have just gone to another provider, requested a pac code and all done. Instead as loyal longstanding Vodafone customers we are now left going round and round in circles again. Lesson learnt, won’t be making that mistake again."
103789,"DO NOT USE this company!!!

Now demanding her lease agreement and other hoops to jump through because they didn’t cancel the account when they should have. Unbelievably unbelievable!

197340,"I have been with Virgin Media over 10 years. My contact finishes end of Dec 22. So I phoned Friday 25th November and got a offer of £35.00 for a new package due to the time I had been with Virgin Media. Was very happy and next day I recieved a email saying my new package was £79.00. I phoned again Saturday 26th November and they said they don't have any records of the new package and tried to sell the same package again for £48.00. I said I was not happy and wanted to speak to someone about this. They said someone will phone me in the next day or 2. No call. So phoned again on Mon 28th November 22. Got cut off 2 times and again try selling me the same package again at £56.00. They said I declined the £35.00 package which was not true and all of a sudden had a record of £35.00 Package which previous they said they did not. After 3 times phoning and being cut of by Virgin Media I was so stressed and feel really let down so I just thought no more and cancel my account. I have never been treated this way before by Virgin Media and the Customer Service is poor. Someone needs to look into how Customer Service conduct themselves. I didn't really want to write this review has I never had a problem with Virgin Media before but feel really let down by Virgin Media. My contact with Virgin Media mobile is coming to a end so will be switching providers on that too. Looking at other peoples reviews and how low there Virgin Media trustpilot reviews are there seems to be some ongoing problems with Virgin Media. I can only end by saying I hope they sort things out how there Customer Service operates.

Update I have tried so hard to sort things out and even though someone has left a review from Virgin and said phone these numbers ( You Just Cannot Get To Speak To Someone ). I am leaving Virgin, Disconnection is 28th December 22. They have charged me £50.28 from a period from 13 Dec 22 to 12 Jan 23. So now being charged for a service I don` t have. I read on there site you have to wait upto 45 days to be credited. I can only say what a experience I had with Virgin. 10 plus years customer and in the end total kick in the teeth."
174923,"Bought an iPhone 12 Pro Max grade C from CEX, rather pleased with the condition of the phone. Performing well so far with decent battery life for my medium usage. I could have actually gone for the 256gb now that I've sync'd it with my old device data. Nonetheless, Happy customer!"

169631,"Vodafone has declined over last few years. Network service unreliable, even though I have full signal on multiple devices, ""no internet connection"". They are quick to take your money, by not willing to provide the service. Customer service is terrible and takes you around in circles. It took me 1.5hrs just to get a PAC code. Before that over 3 hrs just to talk to someone. Vodafone is unable to resolve network problems in my area and keep blaming my devices. Tested with other networks and is works perfectly fine. I've asked them multiple times to resolve and failed. I'm leaving and going back to O2."

197305,"I'm waiting to hear back from the ombusman after getting no where with official complaints to now tv. Resulting into deadlock.
I cancelled a now tv promotion offer before I had to start making payments to them. Unbeknown to me, now tv continued to take payments from my credit card every month for a year. I only found out when I cancelled the credit card.
I contacted now tv explained that I had cancelled blah, blah, blah.
They confirmed that they could see that I ""tried to cancel "" but it hadn't gone through correctly. I hadn't read the 4 pages that come after you've pressed the cancel button, therefore I hadn't cancelled even though I was led to thinking that I had. But apparently it's my fault because I didn't read the extra 4 pages!!
They offered me 3 months as a refund, this went up to 5 months.
I am fighting to get a full refund and have had to take the complaint to the ombusman.
This company should be closed down. It's dishonest, manipulative, misleading, sleazy and a complete shambles.
Avoid, avoid, avoid!!!"

199255,"The best thing that happened to me 2022, was that BT sales converted my online deal selection. Diverting me to sales they did an upsell and concealed the upfront cost I’d be subject to. Well thank you for ripping me off. I cooled off after numerous calls to you to try and fix this. Your staff were totally inept. Glad to lose me even. But then my past provider Talktalk arrived to our new postcode area. The deals ! £165 better than you ! £75 of which will be a tasty voucher in 42 days. Thank you BT for ripping me off and then failing to fix it. Yes I tested the waters with you and never will dip this way, ever again. But thank you for 3 mths free internet with Talktalk. I’ll thank you as I spend my £72 bonus voucher ! And smile every mth hereafter free or when I pay £28. I was upset before but could not believe my luck today. I hope you get a returns bag here real quick and get your junk out of my house for good…."

191392,"Absolutely shocking service from BT Business, placed a order for BT ICloud on 10th June, needed to have a new broadband line installed to allow for the existing line to switch to digital. First open reach engineer came and said we didn’t need another broadband line, said it was BT over selling so went away again, then had the privilege of being charged £130 for being unavailable on this visit. Had another appointment rearranged for last Wednesday 23rd June waited from 8am - 1pm no engineer showed up. Had another visit from openreach this morning, engineer said we would lose our existing number so he said he would call head office to sort out for us with this he drove away without installing another line. At 16.46 had an email to say new broadband service has been installed and is now active. He didn’t even enter our office so not sure where he has installed broadband too.
Tried to call BT this afternoon and have been cut off 4 times. I now have a new broadband contract with is totally useless.
Basically I have had enough of this disgusting service, worst company I have ever dealt with, If I ran my business like this I wouldn’t have a business. I suggest a business manager contacts me in the next 24 hours before I report to Ofcom and also the Financial Services for entering me into a financial contract for a service I haven’t got."

We thought as computer is 6 years old, that's it, we would have to buy a new tower but phoned PCspecialist support line anyway. After speaking to the wonderful Dylan Ho for just over two hours, he remotely fixed our problem.

He was clear with his instructions, was patient with us and fixed the problem in the end.

congratulations PcSpecilist for having a very high quality of staff in Dylan."
160853,"Overall good service with many customisable templates. I am leaving only 3 stars because of the paper quality for the wedding invitations. I found the paper quite see through and not thick enough. Perhaps mentioning paper thickness or being able to choose better quality paper would be a good additional feature. I am glad i managed to get a large discount on the order, i definitely would have been super upset paying the full price for produced paper quality."
120407,"At first i was very impressed however it changed when a plastic hook on the frame came off. I assembled it inside to get it ready and followed the instructions, which are easy to follow. When putting the net on the plastic hook one snapped off the frame. So now a ball goes throw the back of the net. The plastic holder isnt a screw so i cant remove it to take out and add another myself. It needs a new part 5 to fix it. Poor design on the plastic hooks which hold the net to the metal especially when they take a lot of force again and again."

Plus I’ve called there customer services 10 times or more and still hasn’t been resolved or getting the call backs that they said I would get I’m still waiting now they are a absolute joke of a company false promises and they won’t do anything to resolve it so I have taken this further to trading standards and now court! Because as I said they have ruined our lives because of incompetent employees and the shambles of a customer service team"

106449,"Failed Upgrade and Return
I have upgraded my I phone 7 on the 18th of May, on the phone with
Carphone Warehouse.
I wanted to upgrade to the Iphone Xs, two days after when I received the
phone I’ve realised that was actually an Iphone Xr, annoying but not the
end of the world.
I didn’t even bother unseal it, so I went to the nearest Carphone
Warehouse, and they suggest me to return it, as I had 14 days available
to return it, so I did.
I returned the phone through Royal Mail first class with Signature,
which I have the receipt and tracking number.
After many calls and email and after complaints to customer service,
apparently saying that the warehouse have to close the return from their
side only when they have received the phone back.
I have track the phone on Royal mail and it has been received and signed
for it on the 23rd of May.

We are now on the 10th of August and if I call the customer service and
their reply will always be;
“we are waiting for the warehouse to close the return, please allow 3-5
days for it and/or someone will be in contact with you, but I‘ve never
received a call from anyone from Carohone Warehouse.

I’m paying for this new phone and contract every month since May, and
still using my old phone, which is obviously beyond ridiculous.

I hope this review will help me get the attention from CARPHONE
WAREHOUSE and sort this out as soon as possible.

164796,"I have been dealing with Customer Services for CarPhone Warehouse for the last 2 months. My problem is still not resolved. It is extremely difficult to get through to them on the phone, they are based in Cape Town, but have no choice as the CarPhone Warehouse shop I bought my phone from is now closed. I have eventually spoken to 7 different Customer Services staff. They all give different reasons why I have not received a payment from them. Their training seems non existent. I would give a rating of 0 out of 10. I would not recommend people to buy from CarPhone Warehouse."

Cheerful and helpful even in really icy conditions, delivery couldn’t have gone smoother."

Sent special delivery as they say will be processed and sent payment the same day, which is load of rubbish as they received it at 8:45am and didn’t do anything at all the whole day, into today I then receive an amended offer of £110 saying there are black spots on my camera lens and will need replacing , which is absolute cr*p my phone has had case, screen protector and camera protectors the whole time I’ve had it, it doesn’t have 1 mark atall on it. They are just scammer mate , and Ive seen so many bad reviews after sending my phone that I instantly regretted it. Do not use them!!!

113669,Updated. Called.back monday took almost 2 hours of different departments but in end was able to move forward mu upgrade date to Monday and sent new phone. Should be here in couple hours. If any problems with vodaphone I'd call Monday to Friday. Weekends no decision makers it seemed. Happy got resolved.Useless. Bloke spoke to wanted to help but hands were.tied. I am disabled and recently lost my home.to a fire started in neighbours property and am in a hostel. changed my plan to max with 5g thinking the phone I had thats only 2 years old.be 5g compatible. Turns out its not. Called.to see if can add 5 g phone to my current plan so on top of the extra 12 quid they getting for me upgrading my package would also be getting payments for new phone. Told me I can't upgrade until 22nd June as this only renewed in March. In March however didnt take a new phone asked if anything can do to help as am house bound as the police allowed my scooter.to be stolen from my garden also after the fire incident. Think terrible way treat customer whose not only just renewed with you but whose also disabled and now house or hostel bound. Updated. Called.back monday took almost 2 hours of different departments but in end was able to move forward mu upgrade date to Monday and sent new phone. Should be here in couple hours.

111232,"I Bought a lumix TZ90 this an upgrade to my TZ80, I was struggling to find it at a reasonable price. Then I found it at Wex Photo Video. I ordered it the same day was very happy with the whole experience. Would recommend them to everyone. And i am happy with my purchase. Thankyou"
145259,"The fitters who delivered my new dishwasher seemed to be in a great rush to move on to their next delivery.
So much so that once they had left and I turned it on, it flooded my kitchen.
I paid extra too to have it connected so this was a great disappointment. I had to wait for almost a week before they sent a plumber to sort it out. Not good really."
106699,"Next day delivery without dramas! Happy to exchange batteries within 30 days when I was not happy with my original purchase, replacements received next day and refund once they had received batteries back. Excellent customer service!!"
162118,"I will say this. They have the absolute worst customer service ever!! Absolutely avoid these scumbags that are running behind the phone. They don't care, they don't know what they are doing and they WILL mess around with you. For the sake of your sanity go with a different company.

I'm having issues with my sim disconnecting and for some reason, the system switched my sim to pay as you go, when i have a pay monthly contract with a phone! I'm a taxi driver who earns as a sole trader and have to keep a business running where customers need to be in touch, and my phone suddenly disconnects, unable to call or receive calls.

I call Vodafone who tell me someone switched it to pay as you go, when no intervention was done to switch it to pay as you go. They tell me its going to be switched back to my pay monthly contract within 24 hours. Now, this is a Friday for a taxi driver, and I lose customers as a result, sacrificing my business.

Next day, Saturday, I call them again, which is a series of 2 calls that went on for 3 hours!! They wasted my time. They keep telling me sorry, thinking words will fix the situation, and I told 2 agents to keep a note to compensate for my work. These agents said they made a note, but guess what, none of them made a note, which shows they were lying. These workers don't have a clue what they are doing and lie. They told me the sim is cancelled and I thought I'll use another company for a sim and that's it, my contract is cancelled 5 months into a 24 months contract. That's what they told me!

I then try webchat to get a PAC code, and they have the audacity to tell me the fee is £846.10, when the worker on the phone said its cancelled? Why are your workers saying whatever they want when it's a complete lie.

One of the workers was called Menna (Friday 6th August). Kumar was one I wasted 2 hours of my time with! Another one was Sobhan Shaikh. I've told them to bring the manager, but they say there isn't one?? What??? It's been pretty much 24 hours with no sign that my network is back. Your foreign call centres fail to do anything.


I ask for a PAC code and it suddenly fixes itself, as if they decided to rush it up. I thought okay, that's it. I insisted on them to compensate for my earnings for a Friday, which would be several hundred pounds, and 2 of the workers told me that they would make a note - which was to compensate £30 per hour that I couldn't work due to not being able to recieve calls from customers. They had the audacity to tell me they will only compensate £40 at the end with the last agent, even though the previous workers told me the £30/hr request would be noted. Absolutely disgusting liars that don't listen.

Now it's a Saturday night, the phone disconnects again, with the sim card unable to give or recieve calls. They told me the issue was over earlier on today, but it's come back.

I'm now completely stuck over the busy weekend without a working phone, and the customer service don't care, refusing to let me leave their absolutely shocking network that disconnects by having the audacity to insist on a cancellation fee when they are putting me through all of this. They are the reason I am several hundred pounds down on my business through ZERO fault of my own. Absolutely disgusting.

I will consider raising this up to small claims court since they are providing me with a service that clearly doesn't work, and even though they told me that it won't happen again, it just did! They aren't compensating me for their issues, and the workers there just say whatever the hell they want without knowing what they are on about. Many times in the call they kept getting confused, verification checks weren't adequate and they looked at the wrong number at first, further showing these workers I dealt with have no clue what they are doing.

I will never go with Vodafone again, and will take my wife and son's vodafone contracts out. They are absolutely shocking with customer service when you have a problem and will not do anything to help you!! You lot owe me for the several hundred pounds that you've cost my business for not being able to use the phone over the weekend, yet you have the audacity to think £40 is enough.

You need to put me in touch with a manager Vodafone! Your 3 employees failed to solve a problem which you are behind and is of no fault of my own, and has cost my business several hundreds, as well as customers that i've built up a reputation with over years. It is very clear I need a manager since I keep going in circles with your employees who don't know what they are on about or doing.

These scumbags have the audacity to say that you have to stay with their terrible network for 24 months even after all the hassle they put me through, and with a sim card that does not work.

Do not go with vodafone, and for the sake of your sanity, go with a different company. You'll do yourself a big favour."
190669,"Awful company!!!

My husband and I took out phone contracts with three 2 months ago and was going great until we received a call to “upgrade” to an iPhone 14 pro max for £30 a month, accepted it and waited for it to be delivered, an iPhone 13 arrived the same as what we already have so we contacted the WhatsApp customer support that originally called us he was very persistent not to call three to complain and said he’d give us a series 7 I watch free of charge to protect their reputation as compensation, which we thought was strange. He told us the address to send it to which we did straight away and we paid delivery. Phoned three 4 days later as we hadn’t received the iPhone 14 to be told it was never coming to us. After speaking to someone on the customer support he told us the iPhone 13 was linked to our account and the phone number was live and had been set up, after Googling the address it was sent to it turns out it was sent to another house address! We were told our case was under investigation with the fraud team. My husband and I have been trying to get in contact with three to discuss this as it’s been 3 weeks now and everytime we have called the phone line gets cut off! Now today they’ve taken £50 out of our account for this new mobile contract. We are super unhappy and now very tempted to cancel the contacts we already have with them!!"
132881,I was nervous at first and never heard of your website before and this was a gift for my brother. But it was easy to use and I was kept informed of my delivery and what to expect throughout. The website and check out was easy and the product that came was exactly how described and packaged well

Called them up, gave all the correct details of the problem which was a cracked glass and the light in the top oven, fine, now, technician turns up and he says that he only have one hob, really? A piece of glass that it would need to be glued or melted down into the cooker? Bare in mind that I have browsed the internet before writing this review trying to fine a 4 hob INDUCTION cooker that has 4 individual pieces of glass. Of course I did not find one. I said ok, then he says that he also don't have the light bulb, really?
He had a two hours slot to come, he calls close to the end and says that he's an hour away, fine, I just don't understand why, oh why would one turn up to a well described job without any replacement that's needed? only excuses, and for that I also give 0.
KNOWHOW why waste peoples time? Of course I will now be taking to this site for a well deserved RED star for poor customer service feedback.
I will have to request another unpaid day off from work and hope that he gets it right next time around."
145917,"I ordered a Vodafone sim with mobiles.co.uk on 3.6.22. I cancelled this order on 8.6.22 (5days later) with mobiles.co.uk. The law allows me to change my mind within first 14 days of an order for free. Mobiles.co.uk staff did something on their computer and said order has been cancelled. I have not even taken the sim out of its packaging. I am prepared to post back the intact sim if Vodafone or Mobiles.co.uk send me a prepaid envelope.
Vodafone wrote to say my account had been cancelled but i owe Vodafone £15.00 for 1 month. It was signed by Vodafone debt collection department.
I spoke to John of Vodafone on 8.7.22. He kept repeating he couldn't discus my account with me because Mobiles.co.uk did not send my
Security details to them. I asked him why he needs my security details when i closed the account within the first 14 days of the order. He has my Vodafone account no. And my name and address. He does not need any other information as i closed my account within the first 14 days of my order.
I then had to ring Mobiles.co.uk customer service and spoke to Arfan who told me that their disconnections team will get in touch with Vodafone to get the £15.00 charge eliminated.
I wasted half an hour on the phone speaking to both Vodafone and Mobiles.co.uk.
I am so tempted to contact the telecommunications ombudsman to complain about Vodafone's unreasonable behavior!!!!
This has made me angry that i wasted my time complaining about something so straightforward!!!!!!!
People, if you want to enjoy your lives, don't have anything to do with Vodafone forever!!!!!!"
148093,Very good service . Ghd kept in contact with me . Will order from Ghd again . Definitely
105800,Really quick delivery to replace broken fridge shelf. Perfect 🤩
135821,Great service and value easy to use website pictures look great really happy with finished result
130969,Absolutely disgraceful. I was told 2 weeks in advance that someone would be out to replace my hob on the 4th of June. I since had a text days prior saying it would be between 13:10 and 17:10. At 17:40 i phoned the helpline and i was told my visit had been cancelled but no one had told me. So my wife took a day off work unpaid for this. Disgusting. Curry's and teamknowhow are an absolute disgrace and i will never deal with them again or recommend anyone else. Disgraceful behaviour and i am expecting a full refund and more. Shocking serive. Would not recommend
167435,"Just awful. Forced us to renew an expensive contract by reducing our service (they denied it). Saw they were offering significantly lower fees for new customers. When we asked them to match it they refused, despite a public pledge to the opposite. Finally switched to Sky but getting mixed messages about whether they will keep charging us anyway"
148426,Easy to use site. Clear and concise information given about order. Kept updated as to time of delivery.
164327,"HALIFAX STORE.
The 'staff' in this store have to be the most disrespectful, disgraceful people on earth.
The bearded manager is useless, nasty and and unbelievably arrogrant. In this store do not expect to feel valued, to be treated with respect it's just not their style.
When I visited this store on 8/9/22 to TRY and upgrade my phone I was almost abused by these awful people.
My experience of on particular woman who from her strong gutteral accent I would assume was Spanish just amazed me.
She just couldn't have cared less, she even yawned during her time dealing with me and told me she was ""so so tired"" . this absolutely vile woman couldn't have cared less about me. I had to repeatedly ask her to repeat what she mumbled at me because of her accent. I've actually never come across such a disgrace of a customer interfaces person. AVOID HALIFAX Vodafone if you don't want to be treated like less than dirt, and be talked AT instead of being talked TOO. If you don't wanted to be insulted by this guteral 'Spanish' woman, and/or be disrespected by the ginger bearded MANAGER, AVOID this awful company and store."

179726,"The worse service ever. My TV has slight screen problems, in great condition to watch. They took in my TV on the 1st of Feb for inspecion, the drivers signed the form that they didn't find any marks on the screen. After a week, they dropped the TV back with all the screen from up to down smashed up. Can't turn on anymore. I rang them up, they refused to do anything to help. They suggested If I want to repair this TV I need to pay all the repair cost by myself, that will be expensive than what I paid for the TV. I won't buy from currys anymore, nothing is to my satisfaction in the store"
154000,"This is the second time we've used Marls Electrical, this time to order a Samsung Tall Larder Fridge and a Samsung Tall Freezer. Whilst they encountered a delay in getting one item in stock they regularly kept us updated by e-mail and text until both items were delivered on a Sunday. The delivery was on time the the two Marks operatives, Craig D and Lee G were very professional and helpful, good job."

121733,"They limited my internet traffic without telling me for months, the internet was unusable for months. The hub settings not compatible with safari. When I finally got through to customer service they told me there was a child lock on the account that was on by default, even though their account page stated there wasn't anything limiting my traffic. I just feel like I've paid for internet and not been able to use the internet. It feels like it's almost normal for companies to treat us like this now :("

120575,"I has to cancel my service after they Stopped my account due to a credit cars payment not going through. It took me 5 phone calls to finally receive a semi clear answer from their staff as to why they would not let me change my payment method. During this time one of your staff did take a payment from me, after the payment was taken they told me even though I had paid for the service they would not be turning the WiFi back on until they had a statement from the bank. And I even then it would take 2 weeks to turn on the service I had already paid for. At this time I said please cancel my account and refund my money. I was then told they would not give me a refund or cancellation until they had a bank statement. After much arguing I finally receive my refund and cancellation. I am blaming this situation on incredibly poor training by this company as I was passed about between 5 people and not one seemed to know how to handle the situation. This unbelievably horrible treatment has costs me 2 hours of lunch breaks and I am now without WiFi."

DA11 followed by ME7 (housemove) same so called issue. Asked nicely over Facebook how long this was expected to continue for and was given the standard usual answer, along with many others. Great you want to 'improve 5g' but at the expense of current customers having little to no service is not the way forward.
Cancelled today, over the last few years coverage has steadily declined to nothing, in fact for the last week I cannot even make a successful call. Its not the network it was 10 years ago. Voted with my feet and left."

After 12 days, I emailed to be told it would be still be 7-10 days. This continued for days, even though they said initially 7-10 days. I then requested a refund. They said 14 days. Still no refund. I advised that I would go to the small claims court. They emailed back to say 14 days for refunds. I have now applied to the courts and am seeking full refund , application fee and interest. I have now bought another phone of Music Magpie, they delivered within 24 hours (brilliant) and one happy daughter. Do NOT deal with this company. Look at the other reviews, I wish I did......"

Thank you gift goes strait in the bin.
Update on your response...
Nice attitude as always. Make sh***t and blame others.
As well your black Friday deals are terrible I can buy with the same price on any other retailer shop without a deal. Why do you think that people around you are stupid 🧐"

Even chocolates! A 4 pack of Buenos costs 1.80 in store, deliveroo 3.00..minstrels 1.90 in store.. £4 deliveroo.
They should have change the name to DELIVEROB. 😅"
192937,Great price. Speedy delivery. First class customer service.
199554,What I ordered was the correct part that was needed took a little while to be delivered likely been with the Christmas post
162583,Exactly what I needed - ordered children's birthday invitations and there was a nice range of designs to choose from (although would be great if they added more racing car options for boys). They were great quality and each card was thicker than I expected on arrival. Came with envelopes included and looked fab for not a lot of money at all. Will be using this company again and highly recommend.
132230,Absolutely Brilliant. I was kept well informed with order and delivery information. Mobile Phones direct were the only place I could order an iPhone 14 pro max that was in stock and they sent it next day free delivery! Would definitely recommend.

Promised there would be no break in service when switching accounts over. Then, when the internet stopped, was told this wasn't possible.
I've explained our situation 4 times on the phone. The first person cut us off. Second fobbed us off. Third had no idea what to do.
No one apologises."
175655,"Excellent service from start to finish. I used my own protective packaging to ensure the phone wouldn’t get damaged. I sent it via special delivery on a Monday, the following day (Tuesday) I received an email to update me that they had received my phone, and to say I would receive my payment the same day. I got the full amount as agreed, I have used this company before and will use again in the future. Thanks for a great service. Sales Ref: 5291909"
147997,"I have been with BT for broadband for over 3 years. After my contract expired and I was placed on a higher rate (over £90 a month). I called to renegotiate the price and this was brought down to just over £60, this is high but circumstances determined that I couldn’t enter into a new contract at that time. I entered into a new contract to bring this amount down further to £34.99 which I was happy with. The issue I now have is since entering that contract BT are billing me for the old amount of £60 and the new amount of £34.99. This has been going on since October. I called customer services in January and the agent said I’d need to “give notice” on the original account/amount and my bill would be coming down to the £34.99 after 31 days. That doesn’t seem right for a renewal? I accepted it and expected a reduction after a month. This hasn’t happened. I called to make a complaint on Monday this week and was told by the call handler that she’d need to speak to a manager and would call me back that day. It’s now Thursday and I’m still waiting. Absolutely horrific experience from BT."
102852,"Great service delivered next day.
Very happy with phone."

186431,Ordered a washing machine on friday for delivery monday(already off to a good start). The couriers called to give me an hours notice of arrival but when they got to my item they found it to be damaged so couldn not deliver. I contacted hughes on webchat at about 4pm and was assured that I would get a replacement delivered next day !!! It actually turned up at 7am !!!! amazing customer service and the price was superb as well
182857,Bad callback service that doesn’t call you . Poor internet that drops off at a premium price
101027,Easy and excellent service from ordering to delivery.
153621,Shocking. Utter thieves. They fully acknowledge cancelling my cancellation and continuing to take unauthorised payments from my account and then expect me to waste hours and run around trying to rectify their mistake. Utter shambles of a company. I cannot begin to describe how utterly incompetent they are
138484,Signed up with them took over 4 months to get me up and running told me I would get £5.23 for each day It was not running so I made it 120 not running they made it 59 but only paid 22 days and could not tell me why I did not get a payment for the other 27 days and then testing my speed over a number of weeks to see I was only getting 50 to 270 mb when they tell you your speed will not go under 423mb and staff are not that helpful and some got ignorant with me.
112446,"My case was handled by Elaine. Elaine was extremely professional, she demonstrated empathy and worked quickly and efficiently to manage the case. Elaine kept me up to date regularly using all methods of communication. Thank you so much Elaine. You are fantastic at your job and I would definitely recommend you."
164606,Very disappointed with the service. Refused to look at faulty phone within warranty without first receiving £89 (!) to fix the screen. I was faced with paying £90 to give them the chance of fixing it. They may not have been successful or subsequently charged me something else. Very poor.
180532,"I’ve rang up about four times now and still no refund for something I didn’t want. Was told four times it would be back in my bank within 10 days, it’s been 3 months. Even with covid staff reductions etc, things like this can be dealt with quicker than this. Complete scam, money was taken from my bank account without my consent, I’m sure they still have my bank details on file. Some knowhow employee called Ryan told me on this site in reply to my complaint, to call and they would issue my refund.. still nothing. Shop elsewhere."

104029,"Hi everyone, im a customer of Vodafone since 2016, but the experience I get in the previous month is disgusting, I order Iphone 14 on 14 October, after that I get some message “” sorry we don have available your phone we will come back to you in 4 days, after another 4 after another 10 days, in middle of this day I call couple of times to see what was happening, getting just people promising that I will have my phone soon as possible the phone is available in the warehouse, not to worry we will send you soon as possible , just laying, another phone call couple of days later, again promising that I will get the phone in 48 hours, laying, laying again and again , im in the position to don't trust anymore non of the workers of this company already past 3 weeks I didn't get the devices my contact end already in 15 of October and today they charged me 86 pounds for what??? Very bad experience can't trust them anymore, I will complain everywhere I can, they use people and them money not professional.

Now today I spoke with one of the manager of the company tell me that I have to wait another 2 - 3 weeks embarrassing."
113678,Bought a tv cabinet for £150 which wasn't very good quality a piece of the wood broke when fixing it up. Argos asked me to review the product which I did. Basically said it was poor quality and in my opinion wasnt worth the money they were charging. They then emailed me saying they would not be publishing the review!! Hate company's that work like this and only publish positive reviews. I would not shop with argos ever again and certainly would not recommend them to anyone.
169428,"Things were easy to find, delivered quickly and in good condition"
136894,"Not only is there coverage very intermittent but even the offers they push are not backed up by reality or working systems- i.e. I keep getting emails on offers linked to partnership with O2 and I cannot even get onto the app using my Virgin Media login!
They send me emails that my broadband speed has improved but we still have black out periods in service and we are definitely not seeing any improvement in speed.
Perhaps if they spend less on marketing budget sending out spam that does not deliver what is promised and focused on their core services, people would be happier with what they deliver!"
199860,"Absolutely stunning service the best I have ever experienced
Every aspect of my interaction was faultless

127042,Had great service from the staff at your Maidstone store. TV is outstanding.
106229,Unless was supposed to install over a month ago and still haven't nothing but excuses been trying to talk to a manger for over a week
145789,NEVER USE THIS COMPANY. I bought my phone on the 28th April. It didn’t work. I sent it straight back. I eventually got my money on the 9th of August after A LOT of emails. They kept promising the money would be in my account on a certain day and then the money didn’t appear. They did this 4 times. They kept my friend’s 9 year old daughter’s phone - which they were repairing- for 5 months! Quick mobile fix! What an insult!
105733,"Excellent service, great information on compatibility and delivery exactly as stated at the time the order was placed, all a rarity these days but always standard with Mr Memory, add to that the detailed and informed guides for performing the upgrades why would you go anywhere else"
112235,"Currys Price Match is only effective if the human can actually apply the competitor price properly. In my case human error occurred, but then Currys don't seem to appreciate customer resolution to honour the price match. When i complained, it was clear to me that the complaints side may not be unbias, and in fact being managed by the same group of non-UK Currys personnel. My complaint reference was eventually raised by evasive Currys staff, but they think its perfectly okay to not provide any form of resolution to me.
Also - when you provide your email address and don't receive any chat transcript - it tells you as much as you need to know about how your personal data may be sold on by that foreign call centre. What has happened to Currys these last few years has nothing to do with Covid, but all to do with profit at the expense of customer service.
I have raised this on resolver as the current complaints process is not-fit-for-purpose. ""Letusknow"" response for CC0004672433 was really embarrassing""..."
137634,"Another great experience with richer sounds never go anywhere else for my home entertainment. Had a issue with a 2 year old lg that was not able to fix, Felix from customer services was absolutely amazing in helping me choose another tv was a pleasure to talk with sounded so happy every phone call extremely helpful thank you so much a++ for richer sounds a+++ for the service received from Felix"

197339,Wouldn’t even give one star was messed about on so many occasions I was in the shop for hours my little boy was histerical because nothing could be solved
166920,"The rider couldn’t find my flat. I called three times. The 1st time he picked up then hung up on me. Second and third nothing. Spoke online to someone and they couldn’t call him either eventually he picked up and told me that he went to make other deliveries and will be back to me. By the time he came the food was cold. Went online to complain and the agent said he’d refund £9.71 I said I was confused as I paid over £38 then he apologised for the confusion (his words) and said I’d get my £38 something back. Fast forward to the next day I checked the voucher and it’s only £9.71. I spoke to someone on the chat and he said that’s it he can’t refund it reflects the items damaged. I said everything was cold! I asked to speak to someone higher up and was waiting for nearly an hour and no one came. So o called. I spoke to this woman who claims to be a manger and kept interrupting me and she said £9.71 is all that can be given and I told her she just doesn’t want to give me a refund not that she can’t. She said many factors are involved but refused to tell me over the phone saying it’s internal and I’ll have to email. I told her the chat agent the day before said he’d refund me the whole amount she said it wasn’t there in the chat (she was reading it as we were in the phone)
I hung up and called back and spoke to another manger who told me he didn’t have the option to read chat logs. I said can any of the managers see chat logs he said no. So somebody is lying to me … anyhoo now I have to email them and I doubt they’ll refund I’ll just have to try a chargeback them. SMH"
142033,"Signed up for a broadband and calls package, 4 days in and intermittent broad band and no phone. Called customer service and was told following a line check that I needed an engineer visit, that would be the next day. Got a email about 3 hours later saying that I would have to pay £65 for the visit. Called them back and queried the charge and was told to ignore the email and there was no charge. They did another line test and said the fault was an external line fault and that it didn’t need an engineer to visit and this would be sorted by Open reach within the next 24 to 48 hours. After 48 hours still no service, phoned them back and was told that it could take up to 72 hours and that was working hours! So it could be 11 days before it was fixed. Every time I speak to someone you get different information. The good news is that all this has happened within the 14 days cooling off period, just invoked the cooling off period and cancelled the contract. As I have paid one month in advance I still expect the fault to be fixed."
162785,Great advice and excellent customer service in the Norwich shop from Peter. Also did me a great deal and quick delivery. Would definitely recommend Richer Sounds if looking to upgrade your old HiFi.

106635,"1. I spent ages to get in touch via messages wth costumer service. Once I managed to spoke to someone, they lied to me that my contract expires next year in Nov. Also my contract is not in the account and I have no control over what they do.
2. Today I got an email that my new bill is £20 more! This is due to contract being expred and paying the wrong amount as if I was in rolling contract.
3. It is unbelievable that in times of fininncial insecurities, Virgin treat custumers so disrespectfully"
104156,"Quick delivery, everything packaged well, items as described! Thank you"
174564,"I bought a pay as you go bundle from vodafone at the beginning of December 2022. I had no problems and was happy with the network etc. However, because we had such a good reception from the network I decided to transfer my husbands number over to Vodafone (we had just moved house and the reception on his phone had been poor to non existent) My husband is 72 yrs, it’s crucial he has a reliable phone at all time. I obtained his PAC code from his old network and registered with Vodafone who I turn sent me a new sim. The intention was to change to a contract at a later date. The new sim (with his old mobile number) worked for a few days, then, no Service at all. I phoned Vodafone at least 5 times over a period of a few days. Every assistant I spoke to took me through the same procedure of resetting my network etc.etc. I was so fed up with this and eventually gave up and bought another £10 sim to take my husband through Christmas. I contacted Vodafone just after Christmas as I just wanted his old number back so that I could sign up with some other provider, however, I couldn’t remember all of the details to take me through security. I explained that my husband had had this number for 20 years and was familiar with it and all his contacts had that mobile number. I also explained it was detrimental to his well being that he retained those contacts. Vodafone was un sympathetic and couldn’t help. Last week I thought I would give it one last shot to get his number back. I was assured that if I was sent a new sim card with my old number, it would definitely work. I was so convinced by what I was told and was/am desperate to get my husband ‘back up and running’ with his old number that I entered into a contract for 18 months. I waited for over a week for the SIM card and had to phone again for another replacement, however, after activating the new/replacement SIM card the phone still showed ‘No Service’ I then received a message saying Vodafone is unable to activate the sim. I spoke again with an assistant last night and she went through the procedure of activating it (again), she assured me it would become live within. 24 hours- now- over 24 hours later, I have switched the phone off and restarted it, put the sim card in and still NO SERVICE. I will phone again tomorrow to cancel this contract and by the way, Vodafone has already taken a payment for the contract and taken a payment for a bundle I couldn’t use. Inexcusable service and exploitation of people who have no ability to fight these rich companies because we can never get an answer or remedy to our problems and decent services are ‘out of the window’ We are just cast aside after they have taken our money. No wonder they are able to startup new companies like VOXI. Capitalism rules!!!"
169583,"Stay well away!!
I'd give no stars if there was an option. This morning I called broadband customer service, was on the phone to the woman, she was only interested in extending my contract for further two years, I told her part of the house doesn't connect to WiFi. She didn't seem interested and when I told her of my earlier issues setting up, she just hung up!!! Unbelievable!!! How dare she...I should have seen the poor reviews and never have signed up! Stay away!!"
173477,"If they had would have beaten Amazon on price and sold the CD online with free delivery for the price I paid then they would of given them 5 stars , as it was I collected the CD from the store to save on postage and packaging"

My last call today was for 50mins (excluding the wait time, and i was told that they moved the date to the 5th and they cannot give me any reason whatsoever and was basically told that there is nothing i can do and nothing they will do, and just accept that fact. Not even a simple apology"

We were kept updated at every stage and the item was delivered on the day we'd asked for, and delivered within the 2hour time slot given. Packaging was in very good condition so no problems with our items. A good experience (as usual) dealing with AO."

103439,I spoke with Robyn. I was moved to shell energy after my last supplier went bust. I’m off grid with no gas and only use electric (oil for heating) so I get no dual fuel rates. I was on the standard variable and she’s helped me move to economy with night rates and advised about using appliances at night to help with this cheaper rate. More than happy with Robyn’s help :)

I then went on the live chat & was taken through a few sim only options by the lovely lady at the other end. She cancelled my original order & put a new package in place for me. It was all done quickly & efficiently & I was not made to feel that I was incompetent. Nothing was too much trouble. Thank You."

111286,"Overall very Happy with my PC.
Encountered a few minor issues. There was only one pcie cable installed into my 3070 which isn't the recommended fitting, however this is as simple as fitting an extra one really easy. The GPU bracket rubber spacers were slightly resting against one of the fans which made a god awful noise when I started up, again really easy fix just moved it slightly. I imagine this happened during transport so just one to check before using your PC.

The customer service was outstanding throughout, always spoke to the same person. Very professional and helpful. Always quick to reply.
Thanks PC specialist I'll definitely be using your services again

147012,"I purchased a S20 contract from Vodafone, after problems with signal with my previous supplier. I signed up 2nd July, with transfer of old number happening 6th. At the time of ordering I made the service rep aware of my reasons for changing suppliers. He checked the network at my home address and told me there were no issues. When I received my phone, I placed the sim provided with phone into my new S20. I got very little signal. Once my number transferred, I still had very little signal. I called Vodafone over the week, every other day to try and establish the problem. Had to put a complaint in as never had very good response. I was then told that there is an issue with signal and it has been there since July 1st. Vodafone could not help me further, told me to contact CWH. As I could cancel my contract, as it has a 14 day cooling period. So I have until 16th. TodAy I have been on the phone to CWH for 20 mins now and still no response. The service that I have received is appalling. What does one have to do to speak to someone. Terrible!!!"
189307,"I had a Tech Expert supposedly arriving between 2-4 today. No show. No phone call. No message. Since this service is subcontracted to Qube I will know nothing more for 24 hours. Colin from BT customer Services and I spent a pre-determined 10 minutes waiting for the engineer to answer the BT chase up call. Inevitably the Tech Expert who didn't turn up also did not answer his phone. He is expected to submit a report to BT before a new appointment can be arranged. I wonder if that will happen? In addition to all this the hold music is dreadful with song lines ""where are you now? It's been too long"". Has any thought been given to the customer at all?

The Tech Expert finally arrived at 6:20. Fortunately we were home. He was thorough and competent. Additionally, since good internet service is critical for an all day exam on Tuesday he provided clear advice on what to do if the service was not seen to be improved by Sunday evening. Thank you Martin."
135196,Delivered in two days. Great quality disc at a good price.

128555,"I have used Envirofone before, the price quoted is realistic and they always buy at the price quoted.

Really pleased and highly recommend you use them"
196936,Very surprised to see the bad reviews on here. I previously had a bad experience with a trade in with mazuma and decided to trade in my phone in store to carphone warehouse. This was done very quickly and stress free. The experience was great and definitely recommend people trade in via store then sending off
196105,"Envirofone made a very fair offer for my phone but I was also hugely impressed by the speed of payment. Unlike other companies who seem to retain the promised payment for ever, I received payment in just a day or two. I would highly recommend."
179997,The problem is with the delivery service. I live in Independent Living accommodation. My flat is accessible by door intercom I buzzed the delivery driver in but they couldn't be bothered to bring my goods to my door and just left them in a communal area. Luckily I was able to retrieve them but they could easily been stolen.
145626,"They're cheap but why not 5 stars?
One word YODEL!"

186831,"DO NOT order from this company!!!
i ordered a phone about 9 months ago and it never came after months of emailing and just getting the same excuses eg. covid, delivery problems, and then i asked for a refund and still 5 months later haven't received it after countless times of asking and no response back from them, absolutely ridiculous and horrible customer service."
139405,"I would recommend Team knowhow to family & friends. The advisor who assisted me with my mobil phone problem was very acknowledgeable, helpful & very patient with me as I'm not very savvy with mobil phones being a pensioner. He talked me through the process to get my phone up & running again & told me to ring anytime if I have any more problems. Thank you very much team knowhow."
169028,"They are bad company, charging £225.00 per month, I moved to another company like for like £10.00, ok I left them, I asked why is it so costly, they can’t tell me, 3 weeks later, passed to zinc, a credit company, they were nice people to talk to, but at the time all this taking place, I was trying hard to explain to Vodafone, though breathing problems I had, my temper was short, a deal was set by zinc, but Vodafone put more marks on credit, up to date, zinc told me why my phone bill was high, 4 phone numbers on it, 🤔 I only use 1, as off yesterday, phone call to Vodafone, I was calm and collected, pills for breathing helped, I spoke with a girl called Veronica, that was Saturday 30th she said she would sort it out, Monday 2, we see, I told my friends about Vodafone, they did not believe me, till I showed all letters, any questions I will answer really, rating would be-5"
165888,Television was delivered on time.Have used Richer sounds before and never disapointed.Very helpful and knowledgeable staff.
106300,I know it is busy at Christmas so deliveries will be longer but it was the fact my emails weren't answered for 4 days and I couldn't get in touch by phone that bothered me. Sorry won't be using again.
185326,It’s very nice to have the opportunity to repair my appliances & keep using. I’d rather repair than buy another item.

with them ,one staying after 6.pm to take my order which was follpowed up with an email offering any further help with setting the TV up ( I am in my late seventies) I think Mark quest I was elderly during my
converstion with him , I do not like buying items on line but this experience was as it was explained to me
all very good would buy again from you"
133046,"The Customer Service for this Company is second to none - very helpful lady, who resolved my problem straight away - would definitely recommend to anyone - far superior to other hoover companies"
140886,"I change my phones quite often and these companies all give the same excuse, mazuma are trusted but they gave a excuse for price drop as the bezel on iphone has chips in it, well iv taken a video and photos prior to sending, as its had a case on it from new, im waiting for the return so will update after then. Looks like ebay again."
196263,"Every section of this company seem to work independently, for weeks I was bounced between 'call the help team' and 'go in-store'. It got embarrassing towards then end having to go into store so many times, as your staff are more interested in making sales, no-one wanted to assist me. Out of all of the phone calls and trips I experienced (at most) two people that actually knew what they where talking about, everyone else where a complete waste of time. Will not be shopping with Carphone Warehouse again and would advise others against it."
159769,The delivery was great however after very few uses the smeg kettle device started to create a weird layer on the bottom
102377,Chap on the phone was very helpful and despite being sent two left hand fittings we were able to make it work

102712,"My daughter signed up oct/nov last year.. no connection, rang numerous times to complain that she was not getting their service but were happily taking money out of her bank..each time told ""it will be sorted"". 14 days ago.. she was told she would be refunded within 3/5 days and someone would ring her. Today still no joy and was told this morning a manager would ring her! Now its 4pm and after another call to be told it will be refunded 3/5 days and when asked about the so called call from a manager.. the telephonist said is it necessary? Very bad customer service.."
123227,"My question was dealt with efficiently and politely and I was impressed that while I was waiting for various procedures to be inacted, I was kept informed of what was happening.
Thank you for sorting this without any hassles."

184046,Easy booking and exceptionally quick appointment time with excellent communication.
173498,"I ordered a custom built pc for the first time and I didn't know much about what parts I was picking, after I finished selecting and placed the order I then emailed them asking for any advice on whether the parts I picked were suitable for what I wanted. I got a swift reply advising me to change / upgrade different bits to make it VR ready and I was really pleased with the honesty as they could have raised the price more.

Once I finally got my pc and set it up, it took me roughly 2 hours of difficulty dealing with the WiFi as the signal strength was terrible, I then called for advice and they said that there was antennas to install, there wasn't a mention of this at any point nor in the booklet so I was surprised as I've never seen a pc with an antenna before.

Overall, I'm very pleased with my interaction and the pc is absolutely amazing and I'm very happy :)"
158932,"Bought this AirRam as a replacement for an existing one which has provided great service. It is an excellent product, but I found the new one to be rather stiff in use."
168686,Joanne was lovely on the phone. She really listened to what the problem/issue was and was able to send an engineer who knew how to resolve the issue. I felt listened to and valued. The engineer who came out was great at explaining what he was doing and where he believed the fault was coming from.
148393,"Prompt next day delivery. Well packaged. Works very well, just right for using upstairs to avoid carrying a heavy vacuum. Only downside is it feels a little flimsy. But so far excellent for our purposes"
165017,"love these products this machine is used every day at least twice and the last one lasted 5 years plus and still works though had got a little tired
local business to us and brilliant"
153965,"Needed a new broadband supplier, thought i would give these people a try. Filled in the form and a couple of days later their router arrived. i was given a date for connection (10 day wait). On the said date nothing happened until around 9:30pm when the website said my broadband was now connected. It was not, I tried all the self help tests to no avail. Finally, I rang them to be told that they had connected the wrong address. How is that possible? The only solution was for ME to cancel and re-apply, obviously waiting another10 days in the process. No thank you, please cancel my contract."
178209,A very easy simple order process. Always have what I want and both the company and the products they sell have never let me down.
121087,"I'm using an unlimited sim, for the recent weeks in alternate days...there were outages in my network coverage! And while I was streaming the world cup final ! I lost all the network and because of this i missed the crucial final moments of the match! The most embarrassing thing was that I tried to get solution from the customer care ..they told me nothing except something about resetting!!!!
It's not the first time it's been happening!
And this thing they say it almost every single time to every single person"
132204,bought a 65 inch .had it a week and the screen is coming out like a cowboy had done a cheap glue job on it .dont waste your money here.took me ages to save up to buy it.wont make the same mistake twice
104467,"Very polite and professional, new his stuff and resolved our issue very quickly and explained everything 10 out of 10"
136482,Customer services try their best but the language barrier makes conversation difficult especially if they have to go off script. My service is intermittent to the point it is not usable. They offered to send an engineer out on the 26th Dec but I had to explain this is boxing day. Then they said the 28th Dec which would have been 3 weeks without a usable internet connection. Rang again today totally frustrated and they offered me 22nd. When internet works it's great for speed but boy does it drop out alot. Was with EE before and never had an issue but Virgin just take your money and don't really care after that. Bring your call centre into the UK and treat your customers with a better service. I hope more companies get fibre to the house because I'd drop Virgin like a stone.
153635,"Excellent customer service very helpful,patience,and trying to resolve all of your queries especially the lovely lady I've spoken today Mejra M has excellent customer service skills.
UBA"
115250,"I would like to advise BT of my recent experience with them. I recently switched to BT as my broadband and landline provider. Initially I was under the impression I was switching to EE, my mobile provider, and, after a terrible experience with BT years ago, I vowed never to use them again. After the switch I lost my broadband, it was so weak that I was unable to even open an email, let alone conduct normal useage. Emily, the BT agent, took on my case and has been amazing. It has taken many weeks to resolve the issue, but she has taken personal responsibility of ensuring that she checks up after every visit from a BT or Outreach engineer and works out where we go from there. I am happy to say that I am now sitting at my computer, able to perform any task I wish, and I credit Emily totally for ensuring we've got to this stage. She is very personable, with humour and compassion and is an excellent example of how customer service should be. BT appears to have a UK contact centre and I would now highly recommend them. I hope Emily sees this message, along with her bosses, and she is rewarded accordingly for her fantastic attitude and getting the job done. I now feel differently about BT and I hope this isn't reversed in time! Thank you Emily and I wish you all the best - you deserve promotion and be a trainer in excellent customer service 😊"
165761,"Lovely and friendly. Called before arrival and were helpful when here with our order. Thankyou Craig D and Steve H, would use again."
183930,Very helpful and polite customer service operator
145831,Absolutely brilliant pc runs any game like a charm. Good price built beautifully and literally came the next day honestly so happy with it. The staff are very helpful and include a bunch of emails to guide you with your pc. Would 100% recommend to anyone and order again.

You trusted my word that my old phone was good condition .

Money paid within days.

Many thanks"
172832,"My ex-wife Karen was named as account holder and had her mobile phone and email linked to the account for broadband and house phone; this man payed the bills though. You cannot change any of it on the account in the app or anything else and the only way to do so is to supposedly get a new contract. Everything has to be done through the 0345 number which is a nice earner for them!! I raised a complaint with them as after having started the new contract she is still getting the bills to her email. To rub salt into the wound I am still being addressed as Karen ***** on any correspondence, emails and bills. The complaints system emails, calling me Karen, state they have solved my issue with technical help and any problems I should of course call the 0345 number. Good luck with anyone doing that as you end up in a call centre somewhere in the Far East where English is a problem - 3 hours so far and no end in sight. The name is Tim by the way. I see that they reply to reviews but I will scream if they tell me to contact the 0345 number. Update - You will see their standard reply and yes they told me to contact the 0345 number, can these people not read!!!"
143524,"Hi, wrong item sent, I’ve been charged for delivery when I suspect only the cost of the item will be refunded ? Went to place order for said item and it’s now unfounded on your website. Poor experience overall."
141043,A very straightforward process from order to delivery
198080,"Popped in their website and entered some details regarding a possible upgrade from my SIM only to a Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 128GB version.
Got a phone call back from a gentleman called Ali who offered a brilliant deal on it, better than the website. Too good to miss so ordered it.

No hard sell, no trying to sell warranties or anything like that. The gent was polite, quite jovial and gave me all the info I needed regarding both the handset and the Vodafone tariff which was unique to them.

It arrived the following day, fully tracked via DPD fully sealed, in perfect condition and c/w a new SIM. The handset was all up and running in minutes and is the easily the best handset I've owned as things stand.

Top service from Carphome Warehouse and from Ali
Couldn't be more pleased."
192861,"Great price, no hassle, fast dispatch and delivery"
147553,"Fair price, easy posting, fast payment, perfect!"
164744,"Appalling! Have just been in touch regarding my elderly parents' phone line being out of action and the person I spoke to refused to help as I was not the account holder.
I was not asking for information, just reporting a fault, which they could have checked. I pointed out the danger to my elderly parents of being unable to contact anyone and they refused either to help or pass me through to someone who could. Shocking!"
120930,"Awful service, internet always having problems and despite explaining this and even pointing out that another company offered me a free trial where their internet was a million times better they still want £85 to cancel my contract early. Fine take my money, but rest assured I will be telling everyone I know not to go with your company if they want internet that works on occasion. £85 is worth it for the piece of mind that my smart tv isn’t going to constantly be buffering while watching anything, my internet isn’t going to cut out every 5 minutes and it doesn’t stop working every single time there’s a slight wind."
191642,"I personally wouldn't recommend Now TV at all. I recent purchase the Now tv stick and it's not working at all. The remote sticks, can't turn over or go to new apps because in constantly crashes etc.
Also, when purchasing the movies, it's really bad if you have children. They show content with images I'd prefer my child not to see. It's not filtered at all. They may have a child lock you can put on to stop a child from playing a film but I feel there should be an option to have profiles like Netflix does. Which is why I have decided I will not be using Now tv. Really not very good on many levels. They have a lot of catching up to do if they want to come up against their competitors, which in my option are much stronger."
146847,This network is shocking I've not been able to recive calls or txt for 4 weeks and all I get when I contact them is our technicians are dealing with it and will be resolved soon I claim benefits and my appointments are on the phone because the job center couldn't get hold of me they stopped my money this network all ways has issues and needs closing down shocking I would never recommend this service to anyone SHOCKING
175652,"Awful, worst customer service I have ever experienced at the Darlington branch. Have used them for years, needless to say I will never use again. Returning a phone should be a simple process. Lost count of phone calls, cut off several times and asked to leave a store!"
147519,"Recently called BT to speak with them about switching over to their broadband service, I had been massively let down by Virgin Media and needed internet ASAP having been without for a few months. I spoke to a sales advisor called Zain Fayed who was incredibly helpful and he was able to sort internet for me in only one week (something Virgin couldn't manage in about ten weeks).

An added bonus was that as we were opting for the additional EE booster hub, the moment it arrived we had broadband so it was even quicker than one week. Thank you Zain, you legend!"
193216,"I have been with Vodafone for over 25years with my wife and my own mobile phone.In all that time no problems and have always been offered good sim only deals to continue with them.I would rate the servcie 5* up to that point.
Our 2 year SIM only deals ended in July and I contacted them about a new deal but only wanted one year for both phones.The deal I was offered for one year was totally uncompetitive against the other 3 major networksw,let alone the VPN providers.
Went and looked elsewhere and came back to see if the deal they offered for two years they would do for one over both phones.The customer service adviser tried her best but there was nothing better she could offer.
both customer servcie advisers could not be faulted in trying to get me to stay with Vodafone but the deals were so uncompetitive.Vodafone used to have the best SIM only delas but now they are way behind the competition,hence the overall rating.
Intersetingly ASDA mobile who use the Vodafone network offer good 30 day rolling contract sim only deals.!!!!"
177075,"Avoid for a mobile wi-fi hub! I bought a 16GB 3 data card for mobile wi-fi gadget (TP-link M7000). It worked great at first then I thought, ""I'll top it up"". Boy, what a nightmare that turned out to be. I needed to create an account on the 3 website - fine. I created an account but when I went to log in for the first time the website wouldn't recognise the number that came with the card and I couldn't log in. I contacted customer support and spent about two hours trying things they suggested. To their credit, they remained on the live chat until they said, ""Take the card out of the hub and put it back in again."" I said ""But then I'll vanish - I'm travelling and that's my only internet. Our live chat will go."" ""I'll be right here,"" he said. I guess that's the way they lose people they don't want to deal with anymore. I think the truth is they can't comprehend what to do with a card that's not in a phone. I put in a compliant about not being able to log in to my account and they replied ""We've replied: just log in to your account to view our reply."" You couldn't make it up. I've used 8GB of the 16 GB and now I can't get on the internet because the card in my hub is saying ""Top up now. Just log into your account."""

Apparently I can contact the delivery person, call not connected. The app then tells me it’s still being cooked yet the details say Delivered! What do I believe, should I wait? I call the restaurant who tell me this order is not due for collection for another 2hours. I speak to your call centre, what’s going on? they tell me I can’t be refunded and that my order is now in its way I know this is wrong due to info from restaurant. They then questioned if I had received my order yet, twice???? Of course I hadn’t, I’m calling you to tell you it’s not here! My 2 teenage daughters my wife and I had looked forward to getting a “ Deliveroo “ how cool we thought, but it’s far from cool, I feel like I’ve been scammed, your technology failed, but yet you still tried to take my money knowing full well the delivery time was inaccurate.

After that it just became a horror story of not being able to get my exchange done to an advisor neetham having a bad day and failing my verification even tho its always been the same details provided. I am still waiting. Now I've been asked to send ID. Its really disgusting I would never go back to them again ever"
187624,"Absoulte shocking. Rang them up because my tv is on its way out. One bloke sounded like he just woke up from bed and give me another number to ring. After speaking to some1 after ages of trying different ways to get in touch they said it take up to 7 days to fix my tv. But il be with out the tv for 7 days also. And if the tv is written off il have a voucher. So plus working all the time i got to hope the voucher covers the tv of the similar spec or put money towards the tv and somehow use a voucher? Easter holidays. My boy is home, no TV for 7 days. Covid was the excuse. But they can collect the tv, but not drop 1 of for us to use for 7 days which the agreement plan was. Reason why is because they would have to basically deep clean the tv. So if my tv goes off to some strangers to have some work done and one of those engineers have covid, will they deep clean my tv before bringing it back? Its a scam. You paying this money and they got no intention of helping you. None at all. Save the money your selfs and purchase a new tv.. never use team knowhow, because they don't knowhow to deal with customers or run a business they a scam.

Oh and by the way. I havnt asked them to come fix my tv because I'm going to either have to buy 1 first or borrow one. 7 days I a long time"

This is all because of a shocking shopping experience I had with them FIVE YEARS AGO. Suddenly they start sending me their unsolicited garbage.

So 17 days later, with no computer, no way of earning a living without it. Spending up to 50 minutes trying to get a reply, I am told, ""engineer agrees, new speaker needed, no further notes, don't know when it will be renewed or returned.""

I was FORCED to ask for computer to be returned without it being repaired! It took a further 3 days for it to be returned.
Received a text saying computer would be returned with covering letter
Received back without covering letter. Noticed on their website that they claimed it had been repaired, knowing that it hadn't been.

Today they have had the gall to invite me to tell them in a review how BRILLIANTLY they have PERFORMED IN COMPLETING MY REPAIR!!!

They, in my experience, are totally and utterly without any moral scruples.

Curry's have dealt with me in an unscrupulous, dishonest, under-handed manner.
They want your money and that is it in a nutshell.

Team Knowhow you are:
RUBBISH, RUBBISH, RUBBISH.

How about my Guarantee Ryan?
Presumably Guarantees mean nothing to ypur company now then.
SO AS MY COMPUTER IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. YOU HAVE FAILED TO HONOUR YOUR PROMISES,
I ASSUME YOU WILL NOW GIVE ME A COMPLETE REFUND?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Update. 05/07/2021.
Despite dialogue with this company, there has been no repair, no offer of such.
Another totally dishonest company. If they were not dishonest, repair would have been completed or refund would have been made."

191012,"I went to Carphone Warehouse in Cheshire Oaks today with the intention of buying a pay as you go phone. I already have a sim card with o2. The unlocked sim free phone I wanted was £139, I was going to purchase this package but then noticed that the same phone with a pay as you go with sim was £109 so seeing as I already have an o2 sim card I said to the assistant that I would just do that, get it with an o2 sim and switch mine in after I'd bought it. The assistant would not let me do this and was insistent that if I was going to buy the phone I would have to pay the £139 as I had told him I was not going to use the new sim card. At first I thought he was joking as it makes no difference to them what I do with the phone after I've bought it and it makes no difference to o2 either but he wouldn't budge. So basically if I had just not said what I was going to do with it he would have sold me the phone at the lower price. This is the most ridiculous sales technique I've ever come across in my life, I didn't buy the phone and left speechless, it genuinely felt like I was in a Monty Python sketch or something. Carphone Warehouse must rely on people being stupid to make money, anyway it did me a favour really as I found the same model for £100 on the net but they missed out on a sale through pure stupidity and bloody mindedness, I like to try and support shops by going in in person but would definitely never use this place again."

He was looking for a number 11 that dose not exist not 72 where I live."
186074,"Horrific experience. A Customer Experience Executive (Jonathan Phillips) actually told lie after lie in a recent response to a complaint that wasn't actually made.

119550,A totally abysmal “service” during a bereavement where an uncle had died. I tried to change some details on a bill to another relative to take ownership of the line and then get the bill from my uncle frozen. It was for Probate to pay from his estate. However after several calls and emails all I got was I needed to pay the bill regardless and there was no real show of empathy or care. It was also suggested if the bill was not paid immediately the case would be referred to dept collection agency. Utter tosh!!! We will be changing to another company ASAP. BT are in my opinion just greedy and uncaring bunch.
185937,"I ordered a Helios hairdryer for my daughter for Christmas, but the box has arrived with slightly damaged corners.

I also thought I was meant to be getting a free heat protector spray with the product, but this has not been sent.

I have tried to contact ghd to sort this out and ask for a replacement, but have found this difficult. I have looked at their website and cant find any contact telephone numbers for them. The only way to make my complaint and ask for a replacement seems to be to fill in a form they provide.

I would like to resolve this quickly so I know what is happening and can sort out my daughter’s Christmas present. I therefore want to talk to someone, not wait for them to respond to my form.

The product was not cheap (£128.70) so I would have expected better customer service than this. I also looked at purchasing a Dyson hairdryer, and am beginning to wonder if I should have bought this instead as Dyson’s customer service may be better?"

Told pack of lies about not loosing my space in the fiber cabinet. Lost space in fiber cabinet. Bt told me nothing they could do and advised to go to another provider to see if they had fiber available. Pretty poor service for a company that I have been with for nearly 10 years and told to check daily to see if any slots open up in the cabinet when I only moved one Street away and was being connected to the same fiber cabinet. Would I recommend bt ? Straight answer no. Seem to be happy to lie and dodge questions. Sick of phoning them constantly to be told different lies on what they could do to sort the issue.

141136,"Absolute Disgrace.. They dont have knowledge of their own billing system, company policies and how to talk to customer. Its regarding grievance I faced during my Store order in Slough.

I had One4All gift cards and I wanted to purchase iPhone11 64GB model at Queensmere Slough store. However the representative at the store told me, the One4all cards are not accepted due to Frauds and I should be trying at Argos or Tesco instead of Carphone Warehouse. On hearing this, I called One4all and they told me to connect to Store manager on phone and work this out. When I told same to the sales representative he hesitatingly accepted my card and started giving me other reasons this time like, it may cost his job if he bills using one4all cards.

The cards went through the billing, even though he wasn't comfortable and experienced in billing using those cards. Upon completion of order he told me, that the product cannot be returned, it can only be exchanged in 14 days but not refunded. Fine, I asked for the VAT 407 form and I was told that they dont keep it since its not coming from apple.

I would like to understand what kind of customer service Carphone is providing to the customers with such rude and unwilling responses ? Also, on asking the details and information the customers are given raw answers without any meaning, thinking that their answers will work with customers. Please, I dont understand is this how Carphone should build up their customers and carry the trust going forward ? I dont think so this experience will bring any help to CW."

I ordered from a restaurant about .3mi away, but delivery took over half an hour. The food was ready, but waiting for a rider. When it did arrive, it was stone cold.

Deliveroo are really keen for you to rate the restaurants, but don't give you a way to rate their riders or their performance. Restaurants ought to do more to hold them to account. A bad delivery may be Deliveroo's fault, but it affects perception of the restaurant."

I already had Economy 7 electricity and accepted their offer of increased sheap hours if I agreed to a Smart meter, I agreed but, when came 1st October price caps, mine was way over the top limit. I challenged that and received 2 calls, each offering a different justification: 1) I live in a high distribution cost part of England (E Midlands) and (2) it was because I have an E 7 installation! If I agree to give up E7 they reduce my all hours price by more than 6P per kWh.
Then they asked for me to provide meter readings (their Smart meter not working?) They took £50 off my bill for that, thank you. New meter coming shortly.
Due to their cavalier abuse of the variable direct debit I queried advice I'd received - what happens if I cancel that and substitute a Standing Order under my control? The reply - your prices will be increased all round.
Makes me suspect that they are determined that theywill have no problems with collection of annual settlements because they will always be overpaid by we customers.
I can't see that Ofgem is actually looking afyter our best interests at the moment, HMG is helping but reallhy needs to address excess profits and return them pro-rata to those of paying through the nose for energy at this time of incredible ptice rises in everyday survival costs."

Set up DD to pay in full so I got 15% off the price of the furniture; they didn't take the payment but instead sent me a bill with a late payment charge on it!

It's even worse applying to be a a deliveroo courier, applied to deliveroo over 7 weeks ago the same time as Amazon and Uber eats, been delivering for them for over 5 weeks now and deliveroo are still requesting I add them on my zego insurance policy which zego will not do on a 30 day policy.

I email back to inform them of zegos response to the request and get absolutely nowhere but the same request, pathetic deliveroo, come on get your act together this is turning into a terrible experience they Ng to deal with you.

Daughters phone is still off. Have been informed today that there will be no signal for at least another 7 days. In total she will be without a service for 12 days and for this privilege she pays three £60 a month.No compensation agreed for lack of service and buying a Vodafone dongle. Unable to look at account unless I can get the four digit code they can send to my daughter from my daughter. How can I do that when she has limited use of her phone and lives 25 miles away. Asked to speak to a manager but as not a priority bearing in mind she has a new born baby lives alone and is uncontactable have been told by the customer service advisor a manager will call within the next 48 to 72 hours. Disgraceful."

171259,"Been with Vodafone for 2.5 years with a mobile phone contract. Offer excellent customer retention packages even after your contract has expired unlike some other companies.
Now we have their broadband service, offered a seamless transition and an excellent price in comparison to other companies.
We have been on there broadband for less than a week and I needed to upgrade to full fibre - speaking on the phone to an adviser was very quick to get through, helped answer any questions and sorted out a new contract.
I have found their customer service excellent both via phone calls and online chat. There prices better than other ""leading"" competitors and offer great discounts for existing customers compared to other companies.
I am very impressed with Vodafone and have no negatives so far in my time with them."

Told VM to end the contract for Feb 7th- They cut me off January 9th- since then no connection, Call center in Inda, got a formal complaint from the family- VM did the investigation and merely offered feedback to the agent. Also closed my account.
So we have a breach of contract and consequential losses. Also, the Subject Acess request was not Acknowledged so a complaint to the Information Commissioner's office. SO IT'S THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT. Beth and co your sound bites are laughable and meaningless, and so transparent. So my guidance to you bunch look at the Truspoilet site have a group think what is the common denominator??. A big hint it's not the customers"
148999,"Purchased an expensive dehumidifier which I discovered within 4 days that it didn't operate properly under the advertised conditions (5%-30%). I'd suggest that firstly avoid making exaggerated claims in product specs and secondly, when a customer attempts to return an item under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 then don't limit his/her right to two options: 1. unwanted item (buyer to bear postage) or 2. faulty item (forward to technical team to go on a merry go round). Other options should be: not advertised correctly or not fit for purpose etc hence seller arranges postage, return & refund. Thirdly, be apologetic, resolve quickly and arrange for return rather than argue and try to pass on customer to another technical team that is unlikely to resolve the problem nor appreciates the reason for the call: arrange for return & refund due to not being fit for purpose and not operating at a reasonable level at the temperatures advertised.

Also don't offer a vague discount followed by omission of the specifics.

Don't start by explaining that you understand but....

Irony is that I was about to purchase two more appliances from them that I'd set my eyes on but I don't think I'd like the hassle.

UPDATE
A UK based customer service rep called and she was polite and straight to the point and had the return resolved in no time. Hence I've upped the rating to 3 stars."
155592,Be careful. I have been a customer of this company for five years. I have five mobile lines in this company. Their antenna signal is very bad. Their bills are not transparent. They have taken a lot of extra money from me in these five years. I do not recommend this company.

And also cut my current wifi off to say they have put new one in which is a lie have taken 160 pound in two months I’m paying for something I don’t have. They don’t have a clue what they are talking about or doing the AVOID THIS SERVICE.
106984,"The overall process was easy enough, but it stated in a email that if my parcel arrives at the warehouse before 2pm and undergoes a check and all is fine then I will get paid the same day. I received a email saying my parcel arrived and is all good to which they stated they have paid me but the payment will go in the following working day which is a Monday as they received my goods on a Friday.

One time I needed an itemized copy and I had to call since I couldn't get it the normal way. I've had to call 3 times over the last few weeks and I'm still unable to get a copy of that bill.

Also, when traveling, the data passport purchasing is a joke, and would also consistently be broken. I'd have to pay for a 24 hour passport but never got a full 24 hours b/c I would inevitably lose several hours trying to (manually) purchase a new passport every 24 hours.

I've subsequently left three for these reasons. I can't work with a company that's so bad at delivering their service."
172918,The delivery was before we expected it and delivery driver was polite
164976,I ordered two calendars as a present. One calendar was fine the other came with its spiral bounding unattached as the paper had been cut incorrectly. Either Snapfish have no quality control procedures in place or they're not working very well as to send a calendar with half a spiral bound hanging off is poor if not laughable. I got a full refund when I complained. It's the first time I've used Snapfish and it will be the last time.

However, despite my having contacted them on several occasions over the last few months, they have failed to send me the cheque as agreed, leaving me with no option but to take them to court.

I strongly suspect this is not an error, but a deliberate ploy to conserve cash resources, as they are struggling financially. I wouldn't recommend them to customers or investors."
115649,"Just received letter to say price of each of my 3 kids contracts for 12gb has gone from £8 to £19. called straight away and were told if we had called yesterday we could have changed it, but too late today. Asked to log as complaint and were refused. This has over doubled, in a cost of living crisis, way to lose loyal customers with multiple contracts Three. and we don't even use up the 12gb. Was offered to upgrade to 12gb for £14, terrible deal. Absolute greed and horrible customer service at a really bad time."

Sickening

Order MPD103549427 and MPD103549197

We have confirmed hard credit searches on both our accounts just days before trying to confirm a mortgage. Your manager who has been due to call has not rung for two days, and your CS rep suggested we need to phone 3 to get credit searches removed. On top of this you have delivered phones and sims to people who ordered half a day later than us. There is absolutely no goodwill or attempt to sort this, the promised call from a manager hasn't happened and we have laughingly been told by your reps to order again despite the credit searches expeiran and trans Union have confirmed exist. How can it be that we are short of money, have hard searches against us and your CS reps have advised we need to sort the problem directly with 3, a company we have never ever spoken to. The lack of attempt to even match the deal or get close to it is a disgrace."

127982,"I placed an order which was fulfilled quickly and efficiently. With that I have no problems.

However, returning is proving to be exceptionally difficult bordering on impossible as the only response from their webshop email is ""Unfortunately we have experienced some technical issues and haven’t been able to respond to your email.""

You have 14 days to return starting from the day of arrival, but how is this possible when I am unable to contact you by phone or email for a return label?

Thus a five star experience with a recommendation is turned into a one star experience. All it would take is a working email address from customer service."
113885,"Not impressed whatsoever. I placed my order on 17th Nov, on the 29th Nov recieved an email sayin order was delayed due to out of stock item but would be delivered 2-3rd Dec...

I then recieve an email on the 6th Dec, the same as the first now stating delivery would be 12-13th Dec but thats tomorrow and I've had no dispatch email or DPD tracking sent to me so I already know its not coming. Customer service has not responded after a week and so I've now had to escalate my messages to ""Paul"" whoever that may be. Its been 4 weeks now and the item was for a xmas gift. All i want at this point is a refund. Why advertise items and take peoples money for things that you don't even have in stock!!?? What a shambles of a company!!

114651,Excellent service. Really hoping way to arrange a trade in for my old iPhone. Easy to post and the response was extremely quick.
102387,"Wowza what a terrible account set up experience. For a platform that requires an account for you to even use the service, the rules behind account creation is appalling. I had a Deliveroo account a couple years ago but deleted it as I didn’t need it anymore. According to GDPR I exercised my right to be forgotten… WRONG. I tried creating an account again recently but customer support informed me that my phone number is registered with an account already. Ok that’s fine, “can I use that account?” The support staff informed me “no, the account is deleted”.
I’m confused now, how is it that my account is deleted but yet my number is still associated with an account?

The “resolution” they gave me was to get a new phone number….. how is that a resolution? You can’t create an account without a number and most people only have one phone number, but yet my number is registered with a DELETED account. How does that make any sense? And you recommend I get a new phone number just to create an account? Unbelievable.

A caveat should atleast be provided when you delete the account to inform the user that once the account is deleted the phone number used can’t be used again.

What makes me chuckle is that the support staff was so fed up with my question of why would I get a new number (that I would have to pay for) just to create a Deliveroo account they said “that’s the only resolution we can offer you. Thank you for calling Deliveroo support” and they hung up!

It’s so horrible I can only laugh"
158693,Avoid at all costs! Signed up for a free 7 day trial however it would only let me enter an Ireland address even though I live in the UK. They took money from my paypal without my permission even though the sign up never worked and free trial didnt get started.

An nightmare company which should be closed down and Im now reporting to FCA!

137791,"STAY AWAY FROM BT!!! Any other provider would surely be way better than BT. We only took out a contract with BT last November and they are absolutely the most useless provider ever!!! Customer service is useless, unhelpful and confused! Tossing clients from one department to another with no solutions. Pathetic liars. Customer service are very unprofessional and will continuously give silly excuses for not dealing with issues- Either their systems are down or they have to discuss with their unavailable team and get back to you in 2days!! They're always armed with a bag of excuses!!!

SIMPLE ADVICE: JUST Don't waste your time and money with BT. I'm already warning all my family, friends, colleagues and anyone who would care to hear to steer clear!!!
I really don't know why they don't do the decent thing and close down if they're unable to provide the service they claim to."

Couldn't get a copy of the live chat despite specifically asking for it. Couldn't get a straight answer to questions. A waste of time and money. If you can't deliver hot food to people then your business model doesn't work hence all the one star reviews. Partial refund but frankly this isn't enough when the whole order is ruined.

118537,"Stupidly signed up for BT again at 67mbps and then discovered how superior Virgin is at another property I own - 350 ish mbps for £2 less than I’m paying for BT. To top it off BT broadband now worse than before, plus I wasn’t sent a new router and can’t be bothered chasing it. And yes, I’ve troubleshooted and it improves on a reset but then slows down at again. Hopeless."

The order arrived on time at the date scheduled.

I recommend this supplier"

110897,Adverts on a paid service!? You're taking the Mickey. How greedy can you get?

will use again in the future."
111707,"I had a really bad experience with a competitor who were sent a perfect iPad Pro and then claimed it was damaged (when it wasn't) and offered 15% of the original price.

So I booked my Samsung S21 for recycling and the price was within £10 of others but most importantly Envirofone had better reviews. The packaging I requested was immediately sent, and received next day.

The 'phone I returned was in excellent condition, not quite perfect with a couple of minor scratches which Envirofone said was allowed as it was normal wear. I was skeptical and was awaiting for the email saying the value had been reduced.

It was returned on a guaranteed delivery - at 2pm that day I received an email saying it had been accepted, and money would be in my account by 8pm (it was!)

Hence the title of my review - they couldn't have done better if they tried!"

Rang DPN and rearranged-arrived nxt day 10.30am-success at last!!
197015,"I've just spent well over half an hour trying to make a payment via the automated system, without success despite three attempts.
In early August a meter reading was submitted by the tenant of the property we own as the tenants were leaving the property on that particular date. I submitted a further reading meter reading on 2nd September, having been advised to submit readings at the beginning of each month whilst the property remained empty. I was further advised that Shell would send me a total bill when the property was re-occupied. At that time, the customer service was fine.
A very different story today however, as on 23 September I received a small bill dated 8 September stating payment was expected by the 26 September. Having tried but failed to make a payment via the automated system, I spoke to THREE shell customer services staff who all told me they can't access the automated system. The third member of staff confirmed there was a fault on the automated system, but why aren't customers being informed of this from the start? All three offered to transfer me to someone who might be able to help! I was left waiting and listening to endless music but no-one answered the phone. The service today was a total shambles and I've been unable to either submit a reading OR pay the bill. I would never choose Shell as an energy supplier but because our tenants were transferred to Shell when their chosen supplier could not continue. As a result, I am stuck with Shell until new tenants move in, when I will be advising them to change the energy supplier ASAP."
141491,Very informative staff in store regarding chromebooks. Currys also refunded us the difference when our product went into the sale a week later - no problem.
193579,"Never again, I have been a frequent buyer at Argos for many years, I can safely say that now has come to an end, I ordered 3 large appliances from Argos, a fridge freezer, beko, great, a washing machine again beko and again great and here we come to the problem , a NEW WORLD COOKER, it’s one of the worst cookers I have ever had the unfortunate of using, firstly came got it hard wired by a local very good electrician, so the rings work but no display or oven, apparently if there’s no display the oven won’t work so I try Argos who put me through to some uncharming man at new world, they l get someone out so now I have to wait at least a wk if not more and because it’s still within the Argos 30 days I think ok I’m not putting up with this and I’ll send it back but then Argos say no because it’s been wired by someone else they aren’t interested so don’t worry Argos I’ll sit and wait with nothin until some has the time to put it right so that’s our story done and any advice to anyone wanting a cooker stay away from new world as some others have already said, only reason I got it was there were no others at the time but Argos have shown their true colours and now I will be shopping local. Natalie I am not on twitter or Facebook so how does that work , if you send me an email I will reply to it with my details"
162280,"Very efficient, checked everything over.
Was easy to book online and was kept informed throughout.
Engineer came with his ID and was very respectful."
139195,"Having to give another 1 star review as Mazuma have flagged my previous review because they don't believe its genuine, this is no doubt how the company keeps such a high rating. I have had my previously mint condition samsung s20 returned today, I previously sent it off and was given a price decrease as mazuma claimed my phone has serious screen burn and a crack on the back glass, having turned on the device there was no screen burn at all however I was devastated to notice there was a new crack on the back of the phone. Now I sent this in perfect condition and this crack has very obviously been done at the warehouse after if was received. It wasn't on any of the corners of the phone which it would have been had this occured in the post. It was clearly dropped on the corner of a table or something similar due to the placement of the damage. Futher proof that my phone has recently been damaged is that the glass is still loose from the crack and there are still shards falling off, had the crack already been there it would have smoothed off at this point. My phone was always kept in a heavy duty case with a screen protector and I know this wasn't my fault. Absolutely terrible company won't be using them again! Now having to pay to have my phone repaired so I can sell it to an actual reputable company. Thank you Mazuma."
145958,"Paul was very professional, resolved the situation that we had been stuck in for 2 years and so pleased with the service delivered.
Was worried at first because had to pay for survey before visit but so glad I went through with it. 5 stars from me."

Ive just had to renew my contract and this time im out of pocket with a less crap deal
Im paying nearly £10 more and having a less deal , ive had to scrap my free weekly calls for weekend calls which are important for a week day due to lots of calls for my health and my sons health weekend calls are no good but it was the only way to get the cheapest deal and i still uave to pay more than i was the contract before"

184360,Totally unreliable - stops to load constantly or simply doesn't work when other apps are working just fine. It's the most expensive of the streaming services yet it still has adverts... the huge pro of streaming is that it's uninterrupted by ads. It's a shame because it has great shows but the app just doesn't work.
166531,Excellent service and no messing about. Very efficient
103563,Great product excellent service and will be using again shortly.
132267,"NOW tv is an absolute scam, even more than one year after cancelling all their mickey mouse memberships, for sub-mediocre content, they keep reactivating randomly, and (you guest it) start charging monthly fees from my credit card.
Trying to delete my NOW account entirely? They made it impossible.
I will never sign up to any paid TV subscription - it's the land of cowboys and bandits."
122716,Been without a working washing machine since 9th of December 2022. Engineer visit slots not readily avaliable for a week. Had 2 engineer visits; 19/12/22 & 4/1/23 none of which resolved the problem (s). The latest visit of 13th January 2023 didn't resolve the problem despite several parts being changed.
120948,"DO NOT BUY

If your product is faulty, they will string you along with fixes that don’t fix the problem, until it’s out of warranty.

Customer service is shocking, and really hard to get through, I’ve had to send my product back 7 times over the last two years. And they’ll fob you off, and you’ll have to fight to get some help.

So far they’ve replaced:-
Ram
Wifi card
Ssd
Ram again
Motherboard
All associated daughter boards
Motherboard again (the first didn’t work)
Cmos batteries
They also said that two faults were in the system bios.

The last change was the motherboard, I gave them an additional two weeks of testing. Then when the product arrived back, it wouldn’t boot properly and kept coming up with a cmos warning.

I’ve sent it off again and requested a refund. Giving that this laptop has never been working for more than 8months, and it cost £1600+
They’ve said there’s nothing they can do. They’ve suggested that the faults are caused by my electrics at home, I’ve told them I don’t even particularly want a refund, I’d be happy with an exchange, all I want is a working laptop. To which they said no, they said my machine is only worth £325 despite most the parts in the machine being recently replaced, and that’s all they can offer.

They are currently still working on the fault but it’s looking to be another motherboard replacement.
And in future if it goes wrong again I only have the 3month rma warranty. They cannot extend it at all.

So basically when it next goes wrong I’ll have to pay for it to be fixed myself.

If your machine has a fault they cannot fix, you will basically just have to put up with it.

Also to note, RMA’s are not a quick process, I’ve tallied up how many days I’ve been without my laptop over the last two years due to it being fixed. And it’s at 124 days + this rma.

You won’t get through to management, or someone who can authorise exchanges etc without a lot of hassle. I had to post a previous review to try and get someone’s attention, to which Matthew Brown responded kindly, but then didn’t sort anything or respond to my emails.

I will not buy from these again. I also urge you to learn from my mistakes.

I’ll post the specs of my laptop for reference along with my order number.

116943,Speedy delivery. Good communication.
102838,Terrific deal on 2 for £15 Blu ray HMV premium collection films. Very good click and collect service from local HMV store. Only blemish (4 stars instead of 5) was confusing multiple emails regarding dispatch and “available for collection”. Never quite knew when and how many had been sent and when!
178027,Order processed quickly and sent out the following day. Communication was very good.
156407,"I kid you not, Vodafone without doubt have the most appalling customer service I have EVER encountered. The staff are not rude but the systems they have are an absolute joke. The chat is horrendous passed around like you wouldn't believe. People have no clue what is going on, I was honestly on the TOBi chat nonsense for over 1hr 30 and then the agent (3rd one) just disconnected and issue not resolved! Wow! This company is bad!!! I cancelled within the 14 days as knew it was going to be painful dealing with them, that was on July 1st when it all should have been terminated. STILL having to deal with them as they are still taking money, so I've stopped direct debit, and was told that still showing as service is live!! Avoid like the plague/the bad version of COVID. Please just choose any other provider from compare the market! Literally anyone else would be better, even Bob the one man band, or even his dead dog would be better!"
197452,"very bad customer service
and very wrong delevery
always messing food"
176314,"Excellent service ,very fast delivery.
At a very reasonable price would definitely
Recommend."
188589,"Having read previous good reviews about musicMagpie I decided to go ahead and sell my Apple Watch to them.
The price offered was good and the amount I received was the amount offered.
They made it very easy to send the item too."
163352,"Only gets a 1 star because they do not go into negative.
If you want to spend your life on the phone sorting out issues, pay top dollar for bottom draw service, and still not getting anywhere like a service after, so far, 8 months, then this is the company for you.
Words that you cannot use with this company are; professional; competent; caring; can-do-attitude; responsive and timely.
The words you can use are not printable"
158575,Consistent updates showing me the progress of my order. excellent setup instructions and protective packaging. worked flawlessly upon setup.
104944,"Network coverage is terrible, steer well clear of this company when my contract is up for renewal there is no way I'll be renewing it"
182242,Easy to sign up. Can’t wait to use.
126867,"Worse fake piece of crap company ever, i used to have giffgaff sim worked absolutely fine, best network coverage and internet, then someone suggest me to join 3 and I did. Since then its a nightmare, garbage network coverage and worse internet. I made a complaint about it, they said whoever suggested it must be for reason because we are good company, the reason why someone suggested me so he can get some sort of cashback or money from 3. Anyway I made a complaint, instead of fixing the problem they blamed my phone, I have a BRAND NEW samsung s10 and samsung s10 plus, not to mention I explained them when I was using giffgaff I never had any problems and they still blamed me for where I live or wherever I work. I asked them to cancel my contract but they said we can't do that and have to deal with there GARBAGE services. BEWARE DO NOT CHOOSE THIS COMPANY YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY."
171751,"Just so easy, definitely recommend"

The service I have received is the worst I can ever remember getting from an allegedly reputable organisation.
I contracted with Virgin Media for a package that includes phone, TV and internet on 14th October 22. I still have no service.
I have had installation dates scheduled on 8th Nov, 1st Dec, 26th December, 10th January; none happened and appointments shown online slipped continually from day to day.
The explanation given was that there was ‘a blockage’ which needed to be removed, requiring certain ‘permissions’ to dig up the pavement. A VM surveyor/engineer visited on 24.12.22 and declared that there was no such blockage. A subcontractor arrived on 4th January 23 to dig up the pavement and remove the blockage. He confirmed that, in his opinion, there was no blockage and left undertaking no action. Even today, I was told once again that the delay was due to ‘an obstruction’, clearly nonsense. Currently I am scheduled for installation on 19.1.23 and 16.2.23.

I am spending up to an hour a day telephone contact with various VM departments.I have been passed around Customer Care, Pre-installation, Field support, Engineers’ team. Operatives are polite but ineffective; they read from a script and most annoyingly ask at the end of every call if there is anything else they can help me with – when I have no service at all.

I am self employed, working from home with my own business. I have been unable to conduct any business from my own premises throughout this period. I had no TV, phone or internet over Christmas or new year. I cannot wait another 6 weeks, my business will be in pieces by then."
158477,Very lovely guys was areal under the sink gave good advice
110089,Prompt service with polite delivery team.
146017,"Really good service. Phone in excellent condition, on-time etc."
195427,"Took far too long for repair, waited 13 days for Engineer to come out lucky washing machine was repaired that day"
157665,You have doubled the price to then offered a 50% off deal.
172265,"Terrible - don't update the tracking information, don't pick up the phone.

I got told my TV would be delivered in 2 weeks, well its been 4 days past that now and I have received no form of contact from them or response from my email yet that claim to 'Get back to you as soon as possible'.

Trash company"
129402,"Ordering was easy, was told there may be delays due to parts supply, but then the product was delivered 2-3 weeks before the expected delay date, laptop runs beautifully and looks great"
119830,Great variety of items and easy site to use.
116301,"Very fast delivery, and dealt with my questions and queries with quickly"
135514,"I am currently paying £59 for 500Mbps plan and I have just checked that if I upgrade to 900Mbps plan I would pay an extra £1 to £60 a month and it states ""Less than new customer price"". I have then logged out of my account and checked the broadband deals and can see the 900Mbps broadband only plan advertised as £55.99. Currently I do not use my house phone at all and I am being forced to pay extra for landline when I could be saving on a broadband deal without a landline service. This is absolutely disgraceful from BT! I have been a loyal customer of BT for a long time now only to find out BT has not a single care for its loyal customers to help them save where possible. Utterly shocking!"
162894,"Had a washing machine delivered by 2 individuals who didn’t keep 2 meters away from me and didn’t wear masks, even though they aren’t compulsory. Right product was delivered but was then told that because I hadn’t payed for the installation I’d have to pay £29.99 for installation through their company. I then drove to Curry’s who booked my installation for a price of £25. Provided the wrong information and left me feeling quite intimidated when they left. Website tracking was also wrong and didn’t call me until they arrived."
177697,He came out straight away same day he phoned and did a great job very pleased with it
146480,Items great but arrived in damaged packaging and some of the invitations were damaged. I think this was probably the postal service's fault but maybe the packaging could have been sturdier.
194178,"I cancelled a subscription using one email address. As soon as I cancelled they somehow signed me up to a subscription on another email (my back up email) which I am totally convinced I never did. As soon as I complained they admitted I had never used this service and refunded the money. This company is a scam, pure and simple."
147546,"I was very impressed with the service.
However was not contacted by the company to be told my tv could not be fixed.
Just sent vouchers and had no idea why until i phoned up"
166664,Very fast delivery and arrived in plenty of time for Christmas. However I was not happy with the quality of the items received.
135174,I bought few times makita and milwaukeey batteries and they are the right ones from description plus that delivery is very fast
174427,"Placed a order on the 12/12/2022 still not received it I have rang up several times in regards to this parcel and no one has any idea to where it is… then u get promised I will receive it with in 48 hours still no sign of it the customer service is absolutely appalling, only thing I got told is studio is launching a investigation and it can take upto 30 days 🤣😂🤣 wow great customer service"
160715,The memory arrived next day. There were instructions on how to handle the memory and I was able to download a manual from their website for my particular PC. Memory replaced in under 10 minutes. Easier than setting in sleeves in a garment!
177618,"Paying £40 delivery charge & then another £35 for installation (changed door openings from left to right) so that's £75 in total. I was told at the time of purchase that it was £35 for installation and removal of the old appliance which I paid because my mother is disabled and it ment it was all done and dusted in one go.
On delivery the guys turned up & when I mentioned the removal of the old appliance I was told no they wouldn't be taking it away that would cost me another £25.
They were going to take it away if I left the doors as they were but they wouldn't do both.
They proceeded to dump my mums old appliance slap bang in the middle of the grass.
Once they had turned the doors round they left and the mess they left behind them was disgraceful muck everywhere. How was my disabled mother ment to clean up after them?
Curry's, their staff and their delivery driver need a lesson in customer care"
146671,Was unable to get what I wanted on line so called one of the branches that had as the item in stock. Really helpful guy located the earphones and popped them in the post did me. Positive experience but my only grip would be the cost of delivery (almost £7) was a bit pricey.
114407,My wife has telephoned Vodafone four times to set up a direct debit. She keeps receiving txt messages advising that she hasn’t paid her bill. How many times do you need to phone before they action your request. We are busy people and cannot afford to waste this time. Not impressed.
188798,Excellent ..Had results with in 24hours thank you for steering me in the right direction extremely happy with the choices presented to me…
193431,"I was with Vodafone for four years straight, not a single bill was late and not paid in full.

My Contract came round I requested a deal to remain, not even a price match because I'm aware that's not all that doable. Just a show of loyalty they refused.

I paid for my early disconnection fee for my mobile, and tablet. I was told I'd get a refund over three weeks and I basically have to fight them for it.

It is not a matter of money, it's a matter of principle."
132930,Genuine understanding of my needs and a helpful response.
107226,"No HDMI audio out of mac (probably PC too).
While the now player app shows video through HDMI it blocks the audio signal.
Just a huge waste of time and defeated the point of watching a show with my parents.

Tip: If on Mac check out soundflower or loopback software which allows you circumvent this stupid design, however you will need some technical nouse to understand.

For the general user needing HDMI out I give this 0 stars."
112220,Replaced wrong dated calendar free of charge after mistake made on original. Very helpful when we made contact and pleased with picture quality and value for money
124032,Very in my eyes are like no other there brilliant with delivery & returns & have exceptional products you definitely get what you pay for their app is Very safe and secure which is good to hear especially in this day and age of fraudulent behaviour across all platforms 5 Star company ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

155640,"We were transferred from pure planet to shell at the end of last year, and it’s been a struggle trying to sort out the account. But after many months of emails, phone calls and supplying meter photos, we finally have a resolution and it was dealt with perfectly by Hannah.

Hannah was patient and empathetic, understanding what the issues were and providing a solution. Her assistance was most appreciated!"
148165,Would NOT recommend this company - absolute shambles of a customer services team. Order placed on 16Feb21 and after numerous email exchanges - during which time I was told it was with QA / being prioritised / being overseen by dispatch manager - nothing has arrived as of 01Jun21. I allowed a grace period due to the exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic and impact of lockdown but I do not believe this company have any interest in fulfilling the order placed. Have asked for refund - will be interesting to see how long that takes going by other reviews...
189899,"I ordered a Bluetooth USB mini. What came was a antiquated device the size of a large flash drive from 2005 which didn't work on windows 10 / 11. I took it back where I was told it had to be checked to make sure it was wiped clean.I explained it was a Bluetooth not a flash drive, I said how long will that take the assistant said 30 mins. As I had to pick my son up I couldn't wait, so asked if they could send the voucher by email. She said it had to be done there! I then said I wouldn't have time to come back for a few weeks and she said they can't keep it for more than 14 days. I sent my partner a week later with the testing receipt, cex card and my driving licence where the staff member said it had to be me that picked it up and they couldn't give my partner the voucher.so I guess that's that then as I can't make it in to the shop in Worcester until early January because of work commitments. I don't recommend buying on line and having it sent to your address as you don't know what rubbish they might send and the returns policy is like there device, antiquated. Update.. Cex have apologised and refunded my purchase and delivery. I have changed my star from one to two"
198938,"Used once and never again. Order missing several items and clearly wrong portion size. Offered £1 compensation… while it’s not the deliver driver’s fault, my contract was through Deliveroo and would expect them to take it seriously."
138601,Seems my order got stuck in processing somehow. Quick call seems to have got it unstuck quickly.
164095,"About a week late with delivery. No updates on tracking. Logged in to see if I can speak to someone, selected contact, told to log in again so put my details in to be told they were wrong. Triple checked and it was the same as the first time I logged in."
119420,"Overcharged me on my contract for about 8 months before I noticed and kicked up a fuss. Their official response was 'meh'. Didn't get any of it back. Now I'm with Giff Gaff who actually seem to give a damn about their customers.

OH, and PLEASE don't respond to this review with your standard blanket ""sorry you had a bad experience blah blah"" rubbish. I was on the phone to you guys multiple times to get a reasonable solution, and some kind of partial refund, and nobody cared then. So don't try and make it look like you care now by responding to negative reviews."
102247,"We have an ongoing complaint regarding our LG TV which is covered by an extended warranty. After 3 visits to said repair centre we are now awaiting the return of the TV and we still do not hold out much hope that it will be repaired. I will never use this company again . The 33, 000 reviews on trust pilot alone say everything that needs to be said.
DO AS WE HAVE DONE AND GO ONTO THE RIP OFF BRITAIN WEBSITE AND COMPLAIN AS LOUDLY AS YOU CAN."
189176,"Absolutely subpar service, I was delivered a faulty washing machine, it didn't switch on at all. I reported this to Appliances Direct and had to wait 5 days for an engineer from the warranty company to come and confirm it. He then did some tests and confirmed it was faulty as delivered. I had to contact Customer Services multiple times, was batted around between different sections of the company. Delivery charge refunded as a compensatory gesture, but only after I asked for the issue to be escalated to their complaints department. The replacement machine was then finally confirmed to be delivered, I waited in a whole afternoon and evening, no updates. The next day, Saturday, I phoned up and was told that the delivery was now rescheduled for Monday, again for me to wait in until early afternoon. A total of four half days lost for work for this transaction, fourteen emails sent to customer service. I was offered a voucher, but will never use this company again so it's a useless compensation."
175273,"I have used this company in the past and i couldnt rate them any higher. Fast delivery customer service was great. I am now faced with a problem I ordered the phone on 29th Novemeber and had an email to advise i need to provide an O2 bill as they couldnt match my details, I didnt see the email come in untill 2 days had passed the status of my order changed from processing to Pre Order awaiting stock. I tried to call the team earlier today and couldnt hold any longer as i had to go back to work so i sent an email instead. I understand this is a very busy time of year but the low stock/ awaiting stock should be advertised so people dont get their hopes up then to see the order still waiting to go through a week later! It states Your estimated delivery date is detailed in your delivery information, if we anticipate this date to change we will let you know via email. however i cannot even see any date provided other than ""Awaiting Stock"""
116365,This service is terrible. Firstly the broadband speed is awful and when yoi get in contact with them to fix the problem it works for aboit a day then it goes back to being slow again. Secondly customer service is unprofessional and terrible at there job. They put you on hold for nearly 2 hours and then in the end you get hung up on. I was only with them for a month and a couple weeks into the service i was tryin up to cancel with in 14 days but everytime i called and got through they would hang up on me! I decide to send an email which they provided on the website so i could cancel the service I still got no response.. So i called again for days and today i finally get through to them only to tell me that they have no trace of my email nor do they have any traces of me calling. Its appalling. I would not recommend this provider to anyone because the whole experience was a mess. Its the worst brodband service I have ever encountered and im really annoyed that i have to pay a fee to leave when i wanted to leave from the beginning. Just terrible.
155454,"A fair valuation and once you received my phone it was assessed and the payment was made very quickly with no adjustments being made, great service thank you.
The reason for not awarding 5 stars is my disappointing experience with the drop off booth, a great idea which could work really well but unfortunately when you have done a factory reset, the screen cannot be made to stay on long enough for the machine to read the IMEI number."
137496,"I am usually scared to buy online but I found a real Professional!
I highly recommend. It was fast and clean"
126798,Have a laptop with a hardware fault. Drop it for repair. And only thing that service did reinstall windows and update bios. Second time same s**t. Laptop was bought less when half year ago. So question why i should pay money for insurance if team knowhow can't fix it right???
158908,"Fast delivery, pay monthly. Good times."
122509,Fantastic service from Mr Memory! The website is clear and very easy to use to find what you need. The price is great and it was with me next day with no hassle whatsoever. I will not hesitate to use them again next time I need to upgrade!!
185776,"I bought a laptop on here and thought it would be pretty good, I haven't had it that long so I can't 100% confirm it's not going to explode or anything but it actually runs faster, colder and quieter than I expected and as a result I've been using a lot more than I planned to.
The most obvious downside I've got was that the website didn't tell me exactly what the keyboard layout would be e.g. whether it would have a mute button etc, it turns out it's basically OK but I didn't know that before it arrived."
158012,Virgin approached me with a new deal which involved a switch to O2 for my phone and a new sim card. I was persuaded to accept as I was promised a better deal as before for less money. The deal was good but after a day of thinking about it I realised I did not want a new SIM card. I phoned Virgin and it was explained to me I had to cancel the O2 deal with O2 who had been passed my account details. I phoned O2 and cancelled the deal. Two weeks later £152 were taken out of my account by O2. It took me ages to explain to O2 that I had cancelled the deal after two days (which they finally confirmed) and I was promised a full refund. Three weeks later I had to phone again to be told that since I didn't have an account with O2 i could not get a refund. Eventually they agreed to give me a refund on my debit card. That was a week ago and I still have not had the refund although a have had an email saying it is on its way.
161084,Quick delivery love the goods high quality
136869,"Great service, very quick delivery"
139207,Delivery date moved from 21st to 30th. Only found when using tracking rather than informed by email or text.
146071,"Very poor customer service, after 3 days chasing me to accept a renewal contract now i ended up with a SIM that does not work on my phone because it is not compatible with the device and they are not able to help me. 3 days in a row i have kept calling them for this issue and still nothing! Incompetence of the costumer service manager left me cold after being a costumer for 6 years! Shame!"
164394,always very reliable and always good quality
146605,Absolutely horrific experience. I order a mobile 1 year ago and the order wasn’t dispatched they kept saying they had staff shortages. I cancelled the order as per policy and they said the refund would be 14 days - 1 year on I am still waiting for this refund!!!
125954,"Had a delivery booked from Currys, through TeamKnowhow for 21st September. They texted me to say it would be between 2.15 pm and 6.15 pm . Kept checking their online tracking which confirmed it was on its way. Still saying that at 6.15 pm so thought they were just running late. Got to 8,00 pm and tracking still saying delivery on its way. At around 8.20 pm tracking message suddenly changed to read that they'd been unable to deliver and I should rearrange. No text message or email from them at all during the day even though they'd texted me the day before to remind me of the delivery time. Only customer service online seems to be a virtual bot. So basically wasted pretty much a whole day waiting in for a delivery which never arrived and had no communication about it whatsover. So not even entertaining rearranging delivery and have instead cancelled my order and will buy the item somewhere else. Appalling service that doesn't deserve even the 1 star so don't waste your time."
186235,"Cancelled three number, it didn't go through and they had no recollection. I've moved address shortly after, rather than calling me or emailing me they put a debt collection company on me for a measly 60 quid.

I've cleared up with three, paid and cancelled the number and they advised me nothing else is owing, I will not hear from them again.

3 months later they contact me advising me I still owe an extra month after they advised it was all settled.

By far the worst telephony provider I have ever dealt with, they're a bunch of criminals.

Be very careful if you are with this company, avoid at all costs if you can."
148436,"Pulled out all the stops to get me TV before Christmas, great service as usual from Richer Sounds, thanks"
144301,"My husband died recently and as the BT account was in his name I had it transferred to my name. I had not realised that it had a 24 month contract lasting till February 2024. The contract is for BT Halo 3 which costs £61.19 per month. I had asked for them to stop my landline because I don’t use it but they said it is part of the 24 month contract and I have to pay cancellation charges for the unexpired part of the contract.
They said what I should have done was to cancelled the previous contract which was in his name and then negotiate a new contract! Only now when I tried to negotiate to get them to lower the bills because my partner’s State pension and a small teachers pension are no longer coming in, they said no! I have been with BT for over 25 years and this is what you get for loyalty!
Perhaps, that is why the BT share price has fallen so low!"
178187,"Every step of the way, Richer Sounds Southampton helped me with my technical issues, recommended with honest opinions and demonstrations and even offered to help me carry my purchase to my car. Good old customer service, very rare these days. Thank you."
105353,"Having paid for a laptop warranty for over five years I eventually had to take it in for repair. Team knowhow sent it back within a week saying my issues had been resolved. They replaced the hard drive with a fresh install of Windows 10 but no programs such as Office, didn't clone the old drive (still readable but slow)and sent the old drive back to me so I could access my documemts. The replacement drive was dated 2016 (well out of manufacturers warranty) and the team didn't send back the AC adaptor - only the mains cable! They are ""looking"" into it but when I asked about an in-store replacement they said ""yes, you can buy one!!!"" Have now been waiting three days without any contact from them. My daughter's 100,000 word thesis was on the hard drive - fortunately we did a backup before taking it in. Definitely very unhappy and their probable excuse will be ""well it's over the weekend and very near to Xmas"". Bah Humbug."
179008,I have a good experience with customer services. Very professional....Thanks Cex...
182665,"Awful people, awful service, awful team. My symphaties to all the other victoms here and I realised we are too many... I ordered groceries from deliveroo. Half of my items were missing and they were aware so the driver or morrisons marked the missing items as 0 and they charged me less like it was supposed to be. Those little scammers called deliveroo, they refused to refund me and said the order should have been checked by morrisons? Are you serious? Are you that little to blame your own customer business? Eventhough you can see the bill saying less total, they charged me full amount and they said the amount was adjusted. Eventhough it tells all clearly there that they charged me full amount both my bank account and paypal. Also even on their website. And some people have the audacity to blame the market for their fault which I never had any problems with morrisons and you can see whats happening here with all the bad reviews. Shame on you all people... I believe, all of deliveroo's supporters are either liars, family, mafia or very naive and lucky..."
121517,O fcuking stars!!! I've been waiting 5 weeks to repair my laptop which ( I only had it 7 months) highly rely on as I work from it. I can't get through on the phone for an update ( 2hrs wait and nothing!!!). Received 2 pitiful texts and a phone call 2 weeks ago that they just need to move data and it will be ready within few days.. I am here 2 weeks later and not a f***ng chance to track it or get through on the phone!! It's an absolute joke!!! I had to get a new laptop as this is a f****g joke and I just lost my patience!!!
121376,The right product delivered same day. Cannot be beaten!
168812,"Despite previous reviews, I can confirm my experience was entirely positive.
People have said they don't have a tracking number, with currys at least its on your receipt, just go to team know how track it, and it will work.
The 4 hour delivery window was given well in advance, and the guys on the day called me with plenty of notice with an accurate delivery time. Both were friendly and really professional and a credit to the delivery service. 5 star service without a doubt, and best delivery service I've experienced."
109752,"Great customer service and super fast delivery. I purchased the Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor with the license.

196294,"I've been phoning up continuously for the last couple of weeks and seem to be going round in circles as no one understand the meaning of me wanting to change my payment date until 29th of every month, then trying to take money early, and promising to phone me back, quick to take my money but not as quick to help me with my situation, everytime they've tried taking direct debit when not stating any clear dates untill I'm phoning back again giving me bank charges, really not a happy customer can't wait to leave this service and contiue with my custom else where ASAP, would not recommend anyone join as by everyone seems to be having a lot of the same issues

112589,"The fitter told me 4 times there were issues with my choice of machine and how it would fit. Actually it fit fine despite the doom mongering.
But then the fitter said he could not reattach the door to the integrated machine and said the existing holes first needed to be filled by me!
He told me he would come back to drill new holes and reattach the door.
The door is lying on the floor together with other mess left behind.
I called to make an appointment to get the door reattached and was asked to repeat my address, phone number and explain the problem five times.
The next available time to get this fixed (we hope!) is in over 3 weeks' time.
Never, ever again!"

137857,Great experience from start to finish. Lots of product in stock on the website and competitive prices. Next day delivery (other more known websites promising it but then not available at checkout). Kept updated on delivery times and delivered at the precise time promised. It turned out to be a tricky installation (plumbing for old washing machine running behind newly-installed kitchen cupboards) but Stefan and his colleague expertly sorted it - no fuss and very professional. Marks will be my go-to for all white goods from now on.
181956,I went with Sarah H. from KickOff. I absolutely LOVE how diverse the exercise routines are. Sarah is absolutely Amazing! I HIGHLY recommend her as a Personal Trainer!!
103953,"I am happy to report my experience with the BT Team on Facebook. They realy helped me with the problem in my landline. They were very polite, friendly and quick to respond, particularly one lady. She was a blessing! Very attentive all the way, and made me trust and respect BT’s Customer Service. The engineers from Openreach were also very good. In all, they make BT proud.

They couldn't arrange delivery for a week so i requested to cancel the order after spending over an hour on the phone. a week later no refund as promised , Had to call up again and on hold for yet another hour. its the very first and last time i will ever order from very. Not a very good first time customer service experience at all."
173534,"Prompt service, and good prices."
142052,"Absolutely disgusting service, inconsistent information from different staff members. Team knowhow warranty says repair or replacement within 7 days of call. 3 weeks on, I’ve had no engineer, misinformation every time I call, no vouchers to replace item, and worst of all no fridge freezer that works. When/if the vouchers do arrive it will probably be another 2/3 weeks for replacement . Call operators/customer services give conflicting information and not all but some are very rude and have no sympathy with the customers. On one occasion I was on the phone for 2 and a half hours being passed around from pillar to post. I will be cancelling all my appliance warranties once my issue gets resolved. Never again will I take out a warranty with CurrysPCW."

Hi there, I don't want to continue your service and request the close the account on the same day, but still, you keep on charging me. They sent me an email on 25 October to renew at a different price. I refused to take the contract and told them to close the matter, but they kept calling and asking me to pay the money. I have evidence of each email they sent and reply related to the contract and the phone conversation; as I informed you one month before my assurance that I don't want to use any more service as you are increasing the price on the new contract as the customer service agent said I don't need to do anything it will be automatically done you can cancel the direct debit I didn't every sing day I get a phone call to pay the bill and continuing the contract as I inform my contract finish on 4 Nov 2022. Regarding the email for my new contract from 20 Nove 2022, I will ask customer service to speak to the manager to resolve my query. Know one has an update yet, so I need to take will be taking this matter to the police, continues to call and harrassment and making my life stress full hope someone will resolve the query.

The only negative is that whilst Marks Electrical advertising states free next-day delivery for goods over £100 (the new Tumble dryer was over £200), I had to pay £19.99 for delivery."
197830,"I love it!
I joined BT broadband 3 months ago i switched from Virgin Media
(who was absolutely ridiculous! Just no words.) and i must say i am impressed , the speeds are excellent! Extremely fast across my whole house i havent had a fault yet! The customer service is wonderfull aswell very polite and understandable! To be honest i would only recommended getting BT FULL FIBRE packages (100mbps +) because thats the full fibre which is very fast any speeds lower then this they use copper cables and thats why it will be quite slow so that is my recommendation.
Thankfully the FULL FIBRE was available in my area.
Keep It Up BT!"
158075,"My current broadband contract expires in a few weeks, looking around Now TV broadband was £10 cheaper per month and offered free unlimited calls. I decided to switch and did so on line only to have a message come back to say ""somethings not right, were sorry that didnt go to plan"". Following their advice I called the number shown, after spending some 10 minutes chatting to an advisor I was told that my local ""green box"" did not have any Now Broadband capacity so they were unable to offer me their service.

Should have stated in their sales pitch that ""we may be able to offer you broadband depending on where you live"". Seems SKY have the monopoly on my local box.

Complete waste of my time and theirs. Really reluctant to offer Sky my business again as they now want to charge me £33 per month whilst new subscribers get the same service for £28 per month.

Welcome to ripoff Britain again."

179799,"My daughter just rented a property in Woodbridge which has a washing machine and fridge in which is owned by Hughes Rental. She obviously needs them moved, so we can source some appliances and get them in the kitchen. We asked Hughes to move their appliances out on Tuesday this week. Hughes Martlesham Heath were terrible and extremely rude. They wouldn't do it without details that we are not aware of. It doesn't make sense to block up some ones kitchen with unwanted white goods, just because you don't know the name of the renter. I am sure it should have been an easy solution, but it was far from easy, believe me.
Rebecca at Martlesham took a personal role in trying to upset my daughter. Her attitude was terrible and completely unprofessional. I hope they record calls at the shop and review them. She was rude to me when I called too. It has taken several days and quite a few calls to try and resolve this. We won't be buying any of our appliances from Hughes, despite them being less than a mile away from us."

Called up and spoke to Dacjan from the Polish branch. I told Dacjan what I was using the PC specifically ( Flight simulation). He then started running down the list of components and gave me advice and recommendations. Extremely professional, Well informed, and helpful.

After putting in my order, I was kept fully informed with every step of the process, and the PC arrived early (always a good thing) in safe, fit-for-purpose packaging.

I have been testing and playing with the PC and could not be happier with the job PC Specialist have done.

They refused to refund my money because “I had already paid for it” They should have checked whether the phone was locked to begin with.

The company replied with something that had absolutely nothing to do with the problem. They might as well asked what color sox I was wearing. I wish I could downgrade my rating but there is no provision to go into negative stars."

Music magpie got in touch, it had been deposited into my PayPal account and I had missed it. I do think an email sent confirming payment sent and when would have saved the confusion.

Still waiting for the cash weeks after packages arrived at music magpie"
129698,"I am wasting atleast one hour every day to get a simple mobile dongle sent to me because they delayed the installation. Every time they create an order, it is held up and no one provides a reason. Don’t even know how they operate and get away !! They have no respect for customer’s time. There is no way to escalate anything. Do any senior company officials not look at the social media reviews ??"
111482,"Good quality, nice designs and easy to personalise. The product arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for!"
172065,Was delivered on time I live in a flat so the courier bought it upstairs for me as I live on my own and would never of managed it up the staires fir that I’m grateful

161726,Imagine waiting for your order for 1.5 hours only to see your order falsely marked as “delivered”. Then you spend an additional hour with a customer support who gaslight you into thinking that they need to “investigate further” (it will take 72 hours) and then MAYBE they will issue the refund. They will “issue a decision”. Please don’t spend your hard earned money and don’t use Deliveroo app. P.S. No refund. No attempt of delivery. Please beware of this company.
158940,"Was Called a Liar by member of Customer support when I rang a second time to accept an earlier offer. Asked the member of staff to escalate to his supervisor and for him to give me a call back after he had listened to the calls. waited 4 hours got no call back made direct complaint which was not even acknoleged also made post on community forums which was then censored and removed. Shame really had very little complaint until that happened earlier this week and yea still nothing. Good luck with any dealings your going to have with this company.

134781,I ordered a next day gaming desktop that was on offer. I built it using the same components from a couple of different sites but it really was a couple of hundred £s cheaper from PC Specialist. It arrived the next day with no hassle and less than 24 hours after ordering I was playing one of my favourite games. I also have a 6 year old PC Specialist laptop that just keeps going and going so I'm hoping for the same quality from this desktop.

148016,"I moved to BT Internet for their 900 Mbps fibre with 110 Mbps upload. I moved from Zen, who aren't as fast (they claimed they were at sales time but that claim turned out to be false) and for a while my connection didn't change.

I had to persist, talking to customer support who were quite dismissive of my issues. I cancelled within my cooling off period as I was worried the issue wouldn't get resolved and didn't want to get stuck with a contract I didn't want.

However... in persisting I was able to talk to the right people who sent engineers round who were able to fix the problem and now the service is working really well and giving me the full service as advertised.

I think BT have some customer service issues, but there are some very helpful people in their teams somewhere who can help you get things set right. When things are right it works very well. Big thanks to those Openreach engineers who stuck with it and resolved the problem for me."

Well done guys!
UPDATE: Whilst the gents I dealt with were a pleasure, I've revived my phone back today and unfortunately it is still experiencing the same issue as when I sent it in. I'm beyond disappointed. They say they couldn't find a fault, but I'm not doing this for my health. Now I have to pay off a faulty phone for the next two years."

I contacted them twice & they replied it was fine. I made contact a third time & even though when I gave them my exact address they agreed it was not the same as the one on their system, but they then said 'we use the OpenReach address for your property' - I told them my address was the one showing when I used the OpenReach postcode checker & there's was wrong. I then emailed a screenshot to Now Tv of the OpenReach proof. They replied 'Your complaint has been closed - if you disagree here is the arbitration service we use'..

Worst ever experince for my family we've 4 mobile contract with vodafone as at once it was good service and network coverage and moved Broadband and home phone with them too. Now 1 year into this we can not connect a single device to home broadband all the times the service is down. When you contact this company they will ask you there is a specialist/dedicated department deals with Pro Broadband. I am sure this is **** excuse. For god sake cancel the contract if you can't provide service don't waste people time. I'm trying for weeks to speak to a person and can't get though this dedicated department.

Now thinking I will never receive the phone I ordered and like others have stated I doubt I will get a refund.
This company director has had numerous companies all of which have been closed down owing thousands and leaving millions of unhappy customers. I wish I had known this before I purchased a phone in a panic. DO NOT BUY FROM QUICK MOBILE FIX you have been warned."

days. Still waiting 19 days later.
Customer services promised to ring me back after 48 hrs. Didn't happen. Staff in shop can't help.

What do I do next ???"
100793,"AAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!
Signed up with Virgin, due to go online on 05.01.
Problem1. The connection fee in the contract was about 3 times the price I was quoted.
Problem 2. They tell you to set up a My Virgin Account.
When you try to use it to communicate with them, it just tells you that your email address is incorrect. Spent hours trying to sort this before I was eventually advised that you can't sign in until your broadband is actually connected. What the...! Why don't the morons tell you this?
Problem 3. Just spoke to my existing provider who inform me that Virgin haven't requested my home telephone number to be ported across, so I shall lose my land line for some time.
Problem 4. My virgin modem hasn't arrived yet, maybe it will, maybe it won't, they can't advise me.
Problem 5. The helpline only gives options for signing up or existing customers. Once you have signed up, you are in a kind of broadband limboland and none of the caller options apply to a pending connection. Trying to get to talk to any person with relevant knowledge is just a world of pain. I Just spent about an hour on the phone trying to understand some Phillipino customer service advisor before she hung up on me.
Richard, if you're reading this whilst sunning yourself on your Caribbean Island, you need to get your act together. I haven't even started with your company yet and I'm thinking of leaving!
Well, the transfer to Virgin Media didn't happen. The modem arrived but the promised engineer didn't. We had to contact our existing supplier and arrange for an extension to our previous contract. It's now 5 days later and I'm still waiting for an engineer to connect us to the VM optical fibre system.
Finally got connected 5 days after original date. Engineer asked if we wanted to use the new VM landline number, which we opted for and promptly informed everyone of. 4 days later we received notification that they were changing us back to our old number. We also realised that our landline was not accepting inoming calls. Currently on yet another waste of life phone call to them to get this mess sorted out. Also need contract adjusting to actual connection date but this will probably evaporate another day of my life."

171128,"I wouldn't give this company the one star, if I didn't have to as, having paid £6.50 per month since 2015 for a Smart tv bought via Currys, needed to call on Team Know How for assistance, but couldn't contact them via telephone, so wrote - twice. Waited a few weeks - no courteous response. Wrote to CEO of Dixons, who own Currys - twice, with no courteous reply and second letter dismissvely returned, two weeks later, with crossed out address. How ill-bred and ignorant all these people are. We NEVER pay for insuring something brand new - why would you, so how we got caught up paying Know How for that long, is a mystery and think they ignored, in 2015, our request to withdraw from paying insurance and which we missed on our bank statements. But, as it has transpired, we never got the 'service' we unwittingly paid for - a complete waste of money taken by dishonest rats on false pretences. Team Know How? More like Team Know Nothing - Team Do Nothing. Avoid these disingenuous people."

175629,"Since no one has mentioned speeds and everyone has been speaking about wi-fi cutting out.

I haven't had any issue with the wi-fi dropping, however I have got the Fibre 1 broadband deal which states I would normally have 24-45mbps download speed and 6-8mbps upload speed.

Had an engineer come over to ""improve"" the speed and all that happened in the next 2 days was my download speed dropping down to 3mbps and my upload down to 0.7mbps.

When I asked them to do something about it, the technician team simply replied that upload speed cannot be guaranteed and ""one only needs it if he works at a space station"" which makes me think that they do not have the required knowledge to carry out a job in the technician team department.

Awful experience so far."
132889,"I ordered a gaming laptop from PC specialist as I was recommended from a friend. Building the laptop I wanted was very easy and the finance terms are brilliant. I waited about 7 days and was then called to state the chassis was no longer in stock and so I needed tochange or wait and extra potentially 3-4 weeks. I easily changed the the chassis and CPU and recieved my laptop only slightly later than the original expected time. I am so happy with my PC. Runs smooth and fast the control centre is easy to use and virtually turned on and played.

Highly recommend PC Specialist."

I would like to say that not only Natasha did her best to get us the deal that works best for us, but also the second time we went back to make changes, she was consistent and helpful as always, although we took a lot of her time. She was very informative, very clear, and very pleasant to deal with. We are not technical people but she wrote everything down to make sure we understood. Well done to you and please employ more Natasha's in your company."
152206,Worst internet in all of history. Bought the internet due to it boasting high download and upload speeds and long range connectivity. While these speeds were achieved my internet became shocking. Streaming services often crash. Playing online on my PlayStation has become impossible to play and enraging as it constantly crashes and disconnects from the internet. When I complain all they say is the speeds are high and there seems to be no problem. Honestly don’t understand how a company of this size lets this poor service exist. Complete disappointment would not recommend

117900,"I recently sent my laptop off for a repair with Team Knowhow which was set up easily enough and overall the service was decent. However, my laptop required a replacement of its graphics card (not that I was told during or after repairs). An intel HD graphics 620 card was put into my laptop, whereas before my laptop used a NVIDIA GPU (NVIDIA geforce GTX 950M) driver. The intel graphics card is not near as good as the NVIDIA one, and as a result my laptop is slow, gets hot much faster and the overall experience of using it is much worse than before it needed repairing. I am very unhappy that when I bought the laptop at full price, I was sold a repair and support plan for £199 under the assumption that paying this cost would at least allow me to have the laptop repaired to the same specifications as it was sold with. Otherwise, I may as well have not bought the care plan, and opted to purchase a new, better laptop rather than have my laptop repaired to a worse spec than before!"

145055,BT found fault on WiFi in my holiday home in Wales. Replied to text and arranged appointment with date and time to fix . Made arrangements with site manager to be present to get BT access. Day after that date had email saying they have found a fault and I need engineer to fix ? ( same fault). Contacted BT eventually after one hour and they did not know if engineer had been but told me to check WiFi and if faulty contact then. What an absolute farce and a waste of everyone’s time.
195122,"I have used MM a few times, always a go to place when looking for something specific.
Good prices and a great fast well packaged delivery.
The only complaint is when adding items to your basket, if the product is low on stock, I found that when I got to checkout it was no longer available, however having said that patience pays, it does come back in stock. My tip would be, be quick when checking out if stock levels are low.
Overall my experience of music magpie is top class and I would definitely highly recommend."

Terrible IVR and truly dreadful, repetitive on-hold music (apparently they ""ain't sleeping aroun', sleepin' aroun'"") endlessly for the whole time. Unable to contact anyone, I gave up after 20 minutes. Web chat is slow to respond, barely in english, and also unable to actually do anything (it all gets referred to various ""back end"" teams).

109517,"Shell Energy first contacted me via a text that I could not respond to saying I owed them around 30 pounds. No details were given as to property affected, dates involved or units charged, just an account number. I therefore challenged this and called them waiting for a long time to answer. I was asked on the phone by an employee for addresses of property I owned as apparently he could not find a record of the property. I refused to discuss this with him as it had all the hallmarks of a phishing plot. As it worked out it was a property I owned and apparently the costs were those between tenancies. My property agent and not Shell provided these details. However in September when I first queried the billing by calling Shell they stated that I owed 419.09 pounds. The agent agreed that this was an unusually high sum and opened an investigation. Since then I have received further communication and demands that I pay the said 400 pounds plus. I also received a text that said that the complaint had been closed but that if I was not happy to email them . I did this and requested details of their investigation and why they closed my complaint. Despite intimating in their closure that they would reopen and respond, they failed to do so but continue to send both unsupported, no reply texts as well as written demands that I immediately settle a bill for an account that they are aware was opened by the tenant and not myself. I again spoke to a representative of Shell Energy who again said it would be put on hold while investigations are ongoing (approximately 30 days). No such luck, the demands continue. Indeed Shell Energy are also pursuing the current tenant and my property agent has also been in contact with Shell and they are being quoted yet a different amount. To compound matters, Shell Energy use AI ti respond. These bots are even more useless than smart meters and only push Shell Energy agendas but waste consumer time. It is high time these energy companies ( I have a similar problem with another supplier at my normal residence are held accountable by regulators and not permitted to harass any customer during a period of dispute. Like all reasonable people, I have no problem paying for something that I justifiably owe but will not settle any unsupported bill. Despite all my efforts and those of my agent, the matter remains unresolved by Shell Energy. Stiff fines and customer satisfaction measures need to be introduced. In this way energy companies instead of wasting money trying (so far unsuccessfully) to automate responses would instead focus on informing customers in a clear manner immediately a concern is raised as to why they are being charged in the form of an itemised bill. Should Shell Energy chose to respond, I hope it is in a direct manner rather than my experience so far . (No useless Bots please). Account Number is 6024135 whichI repeat was not opened by me."

I did and £9.99 was took from my account, as soon as the trial was up,as i couldn't find anywhere on the site to cancel the subscription 🤬. 1 DAY after the 1st payment was took,they deducted another £3.Again i tried to cancel but couldn't see how to and it also told me they had upgraded the account (without my consent) and thats what the £3 was for. On boxing day i wanted to watch a film (i still hadn't used nowtv's services yet) but even though I'd so far paid £12.99,i couldn't watch any as i didn't have the required pack!Again,i had to sign up for the 'free trial' and decided i had to really try and find out how to cancel before they took another penny from me!But i couldn't. There was nowhere at all on the
site to cancel! So as a last resort,i phoned my bank 3 working days ago, to cancel my bank card and now I've saw, ANOTHER £12 HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM MY ACCOUNT BY NOW TV!!!! In total in the space of 12 days,£24.99 has been taken from my bank account! If i could give a negative star score i would and it would be -10 ☆

134582,"Horrible. The network has gone to hell over the last year or so. Most condescending customer service staff with anger issues, all the while stupid af, unable to solvw the slightest issue. Forget about travelling abroad w them. They charged me x4 my normal bill despite advising something entirely different in advance. Only to cut off. My services due to fair usage. So I basically paid 120 quid for 25 gig. Another company blacklisted. Will change contract ASAP"
184358,After taking 3 weeks to despatch and suggesting a dpd delivery they used Royal mail with full knowledge the impact of the strikes.they care nothing of their customers.
100148,"The member of staff was willing to listen to to what I had to say, reassuringly telling me to continue as I could speak freely while he took notes. After confirming my details and account.
At first I was not a bit optimistic, as I realised that I had left my complaint a bit late, not having checked my bill for some time. It was actually the end of my contract, but Mike seemed to know exactly what he had to do, and sorted me out a brand new contract which suited me fine.
I am completely satisfied now with a Contract containing everything I need at a price I am prepared to pay."

All praise to Envirophone as by Monday morning I had a text confirming the phones arrival & the offer price . By Monday evening the full amount was in my bank account . I only decided to sell the phone the previous Tues . So within less than a week I’d received the label , posted the phone & received full payment . I don’t know how they did it so fast but I’m super impressed. I’d highly recommend anyone with an old unused phone ( they even buy broken ones ) to contact Envirophone and turn them into quick cash."

115792,"I don't often leave reviews but having called BT to report a damaged cable and loss of internet today around 5 pm, which admittedly took well over one hour to get through and complete the call, I really feel this experience deserves a mention. First of all, the call handler was lovely, pleasant and really helpful, and at the end told me someone would be in touch within the next two days. A similar experience a year or two ago was a bit of a nightmare so I wasn't holding my breath I have to admit Less then one hour later, I took a call from an Open Reach engineer who was just around the corner, by around 8.30 pm this evening, it was all back up and running,
I can't believe how quickly this was dealt with, I work from home so it's greatly appreciated Thank you!"
155738,Arrived promptly and well packed and labelled. My go-to place for batteries.
157912,Very quick pick up and usually have everything I need in stock very pleased with purchase look and fit good .
168582,"Honestly if I could give less than 1 star I would. The actual service when it when it works it is fine but trying to contact these people if anything goes wrong is a nightmare.

I ended up writing a letter to them (This is a communications Company).



I got a letter saying they were looking into it on the 17/10/22. They gave themselves 28 Days to come back to me. No response so far


Following the intervention from Virgin I texted them per their response. No answer as yet

Update 3/1/2023

Next step in saga. I wrote again to Virgin last month. Today I got exactly the same standard letter as previously received.

In the meantime I had a call from Virgin which I assumed was in response to my letter. Turned out the call centre were a little bit slack so they stated to do some random call outs on existing complaints. The person did manage to deal with my issue though.

This could make a comedy"
106729,"Ordered Fri, free post arrived Tues, simple transaction, well executed :)"
112722,"We have had a horrific experience. We are now into a 9-page report on my ongoing problem. We are paying for full fibre when they can't even provide it. I was assigned a case manager advisor who assured me that our problem would be resolved and she would get in touch with an update within 72 hours and that was two weeks ago. When I ring, I'm assured that someone will get back to me with a progress report and they NEVER do. Sometimes I'm even put through to completely the wrong department. Today I was called 'Miss' throughout the call which I found extremely patronising. When left waiting whilst the advisor tried to work out what to do, I was forced to listen to ‘sweet talker’ ‘you made me believe that every lie was a beautiful sound’ which is rather ironic since the song is about lies and talking sweetly, making promises go away!! etc. Yes, very appropriate. All I need is a progress report and information on when the line will be fixed (Open Reach disconnected our copper wiring). I really want to speak to someone who actually does what they say they're going to do. I'm being generous with one star and if I don't get back every single pound I've spent with them since the beginning of the new contract, I'm going to the media and the ombudsman. We are at our wits's end. Dont' touch BT with a barge pole."
198173,I have just bought a phone from Currys. The shop assistant sold me a google pixel 7 with a free fit bit offer. It took a week for the phone to arrive at the store and when I looked up how to claim the fit bit it states that the offer ran out on 24th December. It was clearly displayed on 1st January when I bought the phone and confirmed by the staff member. This is clearly fraudulent advertising. I feel angry and let down.
147554,"Very happy with my purchase.
Easy to use website. Clear descriptions of every product and great offers. Highly recommended.
Thank you."
121068,Delivered within 48 hours and products so good. Have been using Gtech appliances for many years. Have given them as gifts to my children.
138992,"When I first joined I requested on the same day of installation that my BT telephone numbe(rwhich we'd had for over 30 years be transferred over; was told by Virgin no problem would take up to 10-14 days.
As my Sky subscription ceased in 11 days thought all would be well.
Long story short this didn't happen and as I my Sky had now lapsed was told this now couldn't be done!!
Virgin were no help at all, never even a basic apology or recognition of the massive inconvenience, other than I should contact Sky to remedy what was Virgin's cockup!
I did contact Sky they were very helpful but the only way it could be done is to rejoin Sky, ask for said number to be activated but then cancel Sky before the 14 day cooling off period.
I did try this reluctantly, had to pay £20 but thereafter because of the other hurdles I would have to undertake(including many hours on the phone chasing this up, plus further request for £50) I decided to cancel the Sky,fearful that I might end up tied into BOTH Virgin and Sky contracts!
A bitter experience; why couldn't a Virgin representative have contacted Sky on my behalf???"
142354,Really pleased with this product. I have thick hair and it works a dream. Lasts well and really easy to use. Pleased I treated myself!
169656,Excellent manners on the phone good product knowledge and prompt delivery thank you richer sounds G B
165803,Moving home is never easy but I would of thought a company like talktalk would find this easy. but no they disconnected my broadband then reinstall to the old property then told me I have to take a new contract out but I have all the confirmation info for the move. apparently its not there fault and they were very quick to delete my account and brush me under the carpet.
177722,My favorite app ever! A must try!
158683,"I gave notice to cancel my contract at the end of November and I was told the line would disconnect in December however there were no further payments due and I was in fact due a refund of approximately £6. So I got a new contract. Subsequently I was charged £45.66. I contacted Vodafone and spoke to numerous people before they would actually read the online chat transcript and found that the advisor had told me there would be no further payments. They then refunded the payment onto my account as it was not my error. Admitting it was their error. I’ve then been sent an email which says I have an overdue balance which is incorrect. Now they’re telling me I owe them money again. This is creating unnecessary stress I do not need, especially this time of year. I will never use Vodafone again. Poor unsuspecting people need to know what this company is like!"
101761,"I would give them zero stars if that were an option.
I decided to purchase an Iphone early in December and chose Carphone warehouse as they had several in stock and could offer next day delivery. I could have chosen several other providers as I wanted a sim free phone but the next day delivery appealed. Next day nothing arrives but I get an email to say it will be delivered by the following Monday. Slightly disappointed as I was looking forward to the new phone, but waiting a few more days wasn't the end of the world. Monday comes and still no phone arrives. Tuesday I spend about an hour getting through to customer service only to be told they never had any in stock and they would let me know when they were next available. So basically I was lied to up to this point. After a few more days I decided to visit my local Carphone warehouse store where they promptly gave me one they had in stock, I paid for this and they cancelled my online order. I was told in store that it might take between 2-5 days to receive a refund for my online order. 4 weeks later and I still hadn't received my online refund. Another hour on the phone with customer service and I'm told my refund was not processed(??). Someone clicks a button for it to be 'processed' and I wait another two weeks before I call again to ask where my refund is. Eventually I get my refund 6 weeks later.
As an aside my old phone, that was damaged to be fair, was due to be traded in for £20. Some 4 weeks later I receive an email saying we've paid you £5 for your old phone. I'm not too bothered about this amount of money but a simple explanation as to why the amount offered had been reduced and whether I would like to accept the new amount would seem a reasonable and responsible way to treat your customers.
All in all I feel this is a company focused only on making money without any consideration of the impact it is having on customers. I will go out of my way to avoid ever using them again and will encourage all others to do the same"
195654,From start to finish the whole process was extremely easy and well done ! Will use again.
188628,"Recently bought a refurbished iphone on here and they kept delaying the dispatch of the phone. I can only presume they didn't actually have the phone available but kept trying to stall me.
I then asked for a refund which they were very nice about and agreed to. That was about 3-4 months ago and still no refund has come. I have contacted them multiple times chasing it. They always reply with pleasant emails saying 'our apologies but it will actually be another 6 weeks'. I would really avoid using this company, I don't even know if I will ever get my money back."
185069,"IRL. Swords store. Staff are very friendly and helpful.
Only issue is availably of stock in store and phones sold that have no covers in store with is a bit annoying.
Other than that that i really happy with online and in store customer service received."
128773,"I had a device and unlimited data plan, which I was not unhappy about. But when my contract for the phone ended they should have automatically stopped taking the phone cost from the plan, however, they kept charging me and blaming me for not having changed the plan. Now that I have and want my money back for the two months of paying a surcharge for the device they say there is no record of me having bought a device with Vodafone. Despite being a large company, whether they have problems with the organization of customer information or this is a loophole they use to make money, this method is called a scam. Change this system now!"

166008,"This company is an abolsute joke. Constantly making mistakes, and missing items/sending incorrect items. I used to use delivery frequently, but no more. Yesterdays screw up has led to me deleting my app and I shall never use them again. Ordered from McDonald’s, half of order missing. Not eligible for a refund, apparently. I reordered the missing items, and then they send incorrect items. Again, not eligible for a refund. Driver was incompetent, couldn’t find house (it’s really not that hard) and started driving away, I had to chase him. He didn’t even ring doorbell. I am done with this company."

I sent it tracked delivery which arrived with them on 21st Jan. I was told on 24th Jan that they were sending me a new one but still no product and no proactive customer service. They are apparently now in a blackout so nothing will be processed for 5-7 days (even though this was supposedly done 2 weeks ago and I can go and buy a new set from their website). This was a Christmas present for my daughter that she has used twice

186039,"I contacted the company because there were several batteries I could have chosen at different prices. I told them what I wanted the batteries for and they advised me that the cheapest one would do the job, which impressed me as they didn't suggest I bought the most expensive battery unnecessarily. The batteries I bought are just what I wanted and are doing the job well."

153053,"Been trying to get a repair sorted in my phone. Started off in the 3 store in Brixton where I had the misfortune of delaying with the assistant manager. He was extremely rude and condescending and said I’m not sure how it works here but this is how they do it at Argos? Finally got my phone set off to Apple for repairs and was told that 3 would foot the cost of the repair. It’s been over a month now and I still have been reimbursed. Each time I call I’m told I need a different document in order to process the refund for the repair. It’s clear to see that they are doing everything they can to delay the refund. Each time I call I’m being asked to submit the same information, it’s as if they don’t have any facility to organise the documents I’ve already submitted. Word of advise don’t us 3!!"

101299,I ordered the platnum + straighteners on the 23rd of December on the morning as the website promised delivery would be before Christmas and i had finally been paid. I chose these straighteners against other competitors for this reason. 8 days later they have finally arrived. I tried to contact GHD but their line is temporarily closed due to COVID and they offered a contact form to fill in and send off which i filled in on the 27th which i still haven’t received a reply about. Their courier Hermes also doesn't have a contact line nor does their chat assist work. I will never buy through GHD website again as it has caused a lot of undue stress and inconvenience

196032,"On 19th November 2020. I attempted to purchase a Google Pixel 4A 5g from Carphone Warehouse.
The first online order attempt failed and after putting in all my details, I had a message pop up to say the transaction/order had failed and to retry later.
This I done a total of 5 times each time getting the same message.
The next day I received an email saying “the phone was on its way”, not one phone but two. It appeared two of the five failed attempts to order had been processed and sent out. £918 had been taken from my account.
I contacted customer service and explained what had happened. They said no problem I could send them both back for a full refund and a return label was supplied. I was told I would get the refund in 3-5 days once the phones had been received and inspected.
I had a confirmation email the phones had been received back on 23rd November. The phones were sent back exactly as I received them unopened and in the original packaging
After a week I hadn’t received my refund so I contacted them again. I was told again the phones had been received and a refund would be in my account in 3-5 days.
Another week passed and again no refund.
I phoned again to be told a cheque had been issued and I would now receive it in 10-14 days. I made it clear I didn’t ask for a cheque or want to wait another 14 days. The customer service agent cancelled the cheque payments and requested my refund be paid back onto my Barclaycard. Yes another 3-5 days to wait.
After another week I still hadn’t received the money back on my card and guess what? the cheques arrived. So I tried to pay them into my account. Three days later I received a message from my bank to say the cheques had been returned unpaid. So here I am back to square one.
I phoned again to be told the same old story with lots of apologies the money would be back in my account in yes you’ve guessed it 3-5 days.
At this point I decided to contact them using the chat service instead of by phone, so I had a record of our chats.
Another SIX times I contacted them via their chat service.
All the chats went in a similar vein apologies and promises of payment. It took a total of 2 months to eventually get my refund from the lying team of incompetent customer service agents.
I will NEVER deal with the Carphone Warehouse again."
156090,"It is somewhat rarer to go to a shop in person these days to purchase a new gadget. Online is certainly convenient, especially if you know what you want. However, we were not sure of which projector would be the best for us and decided to go in person to Richer Sound. That proved to be a very good choice. We experienced a great, kind and personalised service, able to understand the customer's need and translate technical knowledge into practice advice. We received our projector very few days later and are very happy about our purchase."

118071,Went along to discuss long lenses and met Adam at Wex. He was really helpful and gave me some great honest advice about which lenses to consider. He changed my perception of what I went in for and I came away really happy. Would recommend Wex everyday.

101730,So far I cannot change my own profile photo nor can I link my Facebook or Instagram. Submitted a ticket and they should get back to me anywhere form 1-3 business days. Not a great start
158401,"By far the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. The whole thing is shady. They charged me even though they said my account was being cancelled. After numerous emails and calls, I was finally promised my refund. That was 2 weeks ago. DO NOT USE TEAM KNOWHOW. You will regret it."
185551,"I have purchased many items from AO and this review is based on their aftersales performance
My cooker was approx 8 weeks old when the oven glass door shattered, it was such a shock!!
The phone calls, and don't care attitude was stressful and unacceptable
I was mislead repeatedly by AO. For example, they sent a whirlpool installer to look at the cooker claiming it was health and safety issue, i asked the installer about the health and safety issues and he said he was not aware of that, he just installs appliances and he was puzzled. They initially offered to replace the glass which i accepted until i was informed the glass was out of stock. I finally spoke to an advisor with common sense and replaced the cooker, this took 2 weeks.....I then had to pay my gas engineer (again) to install it as AO did not use the fitting I had, they offered to try, but if they couldn't they would cap off my gas supply. My engineer explained that it was a fairly simple job to do ...
I will never use them again purely based on the appalling after sales care...Buyer Beware"

After being lied to for the past 2 weeks about a refund I was ment to receive within 7 days and 3 times I was told it was issued but on the 8th day of no refund was sent a email that they sent it on that day so another 7 days of waiting for something ghat I probably won't receive . 400 pound to loose 4 days before Christmas as a single parent I am now stuck and worried sick what I going to do
Told a manger would contact me another lie. I am full of upset and worry

Will be taking this further
And public

Was told he would be given a voucher for a replacement tv and would be passed over to speak to someone else , but phone was disconnected from there side so phone call was not completed . Son rang back and was told by different person that they do not give out vouchers , he was rude and sharp , and was told they would have collect tv for a repair . I came home from work and was told this story by my son , so i rang myself . Was on phone for ten minutes , just trying to get through post codes and address , sounded like man was on other side of the moon and could hardly understand him . Finaly told me they do not give out vouchers . Asked for a supervisor and was told they dont have one and there is no phone number to ring any body . Then says dont shout at me . My reply was i had to shout i can hardly hear you . So in all , van comes on tuesday and will if im lucky might just see my tv again in 6 months time . Wayne bradbury"
147446,"Really really bad experience. Order some goods for well before xmas, only half arrived. Then when I called to query, the customer service representative from Argos was extremely rude. He told me the only option is refund or redelivery after xmas. He said they were still charging me the delivery fee as half of the goods arrived. When I asked to speak to his manager, he just put me on hold and said he is dealing with other customers. Eventually he just cut me off. Ill never order anything from Argis again"
170522,"A happy customer here, easy to order and quick delivery date offered and step by step update on delivery until delivered.

Only person I have ever spoken to on Vodafone that I am delighted to give 10 to. A thoroughly lovely lady, too. Thank you"
192825,"I needed a new computer.
I looked at various sites for pre-built PCs and then looked at PCSpecialist and decided to configure a PC to my own specification.
Selecting the components on the web site could not have been any easier. Choice was set out so logically and made so easy.
The whole process of building my PC took a little longer than expected but I placed my order just before Christmas - my fault!
When built and tested, the PC was sent to me very well packaged and arrived in first class condition. Now it is up and running, It is performing very well indeed and even with six fans, it is so quiet!
I had one technical question and my query was answered very clearly and precisely.
I am really happy that I chose to have my desk top PC built by PCSpecialist."
198677,"Worst experience with a company in my life.

Told on multiple occasions they would get my internet sorted. 5-6 times they messed up and it looks like I am 3-4 weeks without internet due to their incompetence.

Also misled me on switching and couldn't claim compensation.

An utter joke of a company."
145167,"Quick and easy ordering, next day delivery by really pleasant delivery men. I will certainly us AO in the future"

143926,Bought a mobile from here on 26/02/2021 that failed to turn up in the given time frame so I chased them and they said they need longer. Apparently due to “Covid” anyway it still didn’t show up so March 18th I requested a refund and it’s 03/04/2021 I’ve still not received my refund of nearly £600. Do not buy from here so awful!!!

141080,"The Service is second to none, Reported Fault one day next day the part arrived and fixed, Thats excellent service."
153122,"The whole process was very easy from start to finish
Tell them what phone you have to sell and what condition it’s in , they make an offer, which was I felt very reasonable, they send you the shipping instructions, then you post it to them. As soon as it arrives they send you an email letting you know they have received it, next email tell you there checking it over to make sure it’s as you described, if everything is ok they pay for it the same day ( I chose direct to bank payment) and by the end of the day the money was in my account"
182538,"i sent 3 phones to be recycled , i fort the service was very good, quick and efficient, reason for 4 stars , was a let down when one of the phones was valued, had the correct model to start with, then decided quoted me totally different model, which i didnt send,"
164273,"Couldn't have been more helpful. Got in touch with us before taking payment to advise on whether we had ordered the correct parts for our server. Then, following delivery, received an e-mail checking that installation went well anf if there was anything that they could assist with. Would definetly use again!"
177340,"I received the batteries I ordered in timely manner. A very good service, thank you."
126763,Bought two iPhones received but not the types expected.Sent many messages back and forth to finally returning them through Royal Mail but returned again back to me because they cannot trace your address then returned back to me.I then had to send so many messages again before reply and then post it again through Royal Mail with Registered return.I’m still waiting for my money into my account.Service very poor
114246,"Very bad service, We have booked for a broadband account 1.5 months before, havent got it yet. The engineer didnt installed it. But reported as activated. Even if we contact them through phone, their responds is not satisfatory. Our Account number: 1014290920. please dont go with talktalk. We have not got internet connection and keep deducting cash. No technician will come or help. we are moving to another broadband provider."
177503,"Although I had to contact Ebuyer about my missing order, (8 days nothing had come) they were very apologetic and quickly did a next day delivery for me. Item arrived in less that 24 hrs so happy."

140744,"I paid for fitting to be done when my washing machine arrived, it was not fitted I had to do it myself. The man wasn’t very helpful at all and as it was my mother here who I got to stay in as I was working when delivery I feel she was taken advantage of as she didn’t know what he was suppose to be doing (installing it)"
167687,"I have recently been held on webchat with Virgin Media, trying to cancel the service for 25 hours. The WhatsApp interface didn't connect.

The online webchat took two more hours to connect, when connected, they simply kept asking more questions rather than cancelling the service as requested numerous times.

Shocking."
116995,Delivery is a joke they use hermes who are the worst delivery service around. Still waiting for item a 3 weeks later and cannot get intouch with ghd or hermes. Discusting service.
138116,great to not have to buy new. battery doesnt work but great price makes up for it
127803,"Everything was really easy to use, it got delivered early and setting up literally took less than 10 minutes."
184227,"Ordered a fridge freezer from Currys, with a door reversal as it would be situated in a corner and difficult to access otherwise. Was told the high fee for this was 'because an engineer has to make sure it's done correctly for the door seals'.

They missed the original 4-hour delivery slot (all my food is defrosting in a chill bag waiting for the new fridge during this time) but call me at the point they *should* have arrived to ask what kind of installation I needed. Thought this was odd, but turns out as they were running late they said they hadn't got time to fit the door in the way I needed (and paid for). The chap eventually relented and said he'd do it 'as a favour', but panicked when he took the top off and said he wasn't familiar with the model, hadn't been trained and left it as it was. Off they went to the next delivery.

Cue an hour or so trying to get through to someone to arrange another visit. Someone came the following day (on time) and switched the door around as needed. However, there wasn't a necessary part, so wires were left exposed near a hinge, and after the fridge had been switched on for five minutes, the 'door open' alarm started going off every 20 seconds.

Loud. Relentless. Unstoppable. Like the Terminator, only more annoying. Every twenty seconds. You can hear it right through the house.

Called the manufacturer, and the earliest they could visit was 1 week's time. I think a shrieking fridge would crack an interrogation suspect in less time than that, going off every 20 seconds. Tried the Team Know How line and got forwarded to the manufacturers, who I'd already called.

It's clear they haven't a clue what they are doing, they're just an expensive subcontractor bluffing their way through jobs, and the products from Currys are shoddy, incomplete and sold with no care as to customer satisfaction at all. The first delivery guy to come around spent all of his time blaming and complaining about Currys and his lack of training, never once apologising that we were left without a working fridge. Where was this 'engineer' I had paid for? Chap clearly knew as much as I did about fridge doors. Second guy I called after the alarm kept going off just said 'we're out of the area now, good luck'.

Amazing that any company would want this organisation as their public-facing arm."
112584,Bought a pixel6pro from carphone wharehouse online on 28Oct2021. There was a duplicate transaction which i told them about that day. I called them twice more and it is now 17th Nov2021 and still no refund of the duplicate transaction.
185066,"NowTV Worst TV provider. Even worse than virgin media.
Loyal customer since 2017 with two screens subscription then without warning they reduce subscription down to one screen and ask for £5 more per month. You cannot apply any of the offers available to new customers. Even with 200mb broadband the service still freezes and logs you out. The help chat service ends the chat without warning repeatedly when they have nothing to gain. a dishonourable company cutting corners."
175698,"Tayna deserve high marks for their comprehensive stock, their user-friendly website, and their efficiency in keeping customers informed of despatch/delivery. They miss out on five stars only because of the extra charge (which is levied by their couriers) for delivery to the Scottish Highlands ... which, if they hadn't noticed, is part of the UK mainland."
139641,Very helpful assistance from the customer support team when I had difficulty paying from France for delivery in the UK.

169508,"I ordered an iPhone from Curry's at the end of December, I received my confirmation on 04th January, they said they would be sending me the parcel. Waited for two days, message came saying the parcel had been delayed, waited another day. Rang up Curry's to ask what was going on. They said it was up to the DPD company. Check on DPD website and it showed that the item had gone back to Curry's. I rang Curry's up again the next day, the lady was polite, she ordered me another phone and said the previous one was lost in the warehouse. She said it was next day delivery. I received a confirmation email. The next day, the order has a message: ""Driver cannot find your door"" I've never heard of a more stupid thing from a delivery service in my life. How is it all other delivers arrive but this one cannot find my DOOR? Rang up Curry's again, gave them hell, trying to find out where the hell my parcel was. The put me on hold, come back after 5 mins and say: ""Oh that one is also lost"" I asked for my money back straight away and the answer the attendant Matt gave me was: ""If you raise a complaint or ask for a refund now it will only make the process longer, you will receive your refund in a week"". What a place of lies and stupidity. Never buy from Curry's if you want something, they do not deserve your good money, give it to someone else who actually cares about their customers. To Curry's, I hope you get messed around like how you messed me around."

110540,I haven’t received my order & ghd have not replied to my emails. I cannot rate the hairbrush I ordered. However their service leaves a lot to be desired.
117632,Excellent service. Fast delivery and they keep you informed at every stage. Would use this company again without hesitation.
103294,"Worked as expected, easy to do and paid as quoted"
149642,I have had three responses to my request two quotes and a further company to view the tree in question.
106253,"After 3 unsuccessful repairs you confirmed with us by txt that you would be out to repair the dishwasher on 29-12-22.I checked today 28-12-22 that this date is confirmed and was told it is definite. Now I've been told that you have changed it to 4-01-23.I only found out by asking,apparently nobody was going to inform me of this. I'm really not happy with this terrible service !!"
191686,"Unbelievable!I'm so horrified right now. Need to use the Internet but hub is just flashing. I've been trying to get it resolved by texting them back as they requested but the text wasn't going through. BT is actually a scam,people should avoid!"
135124,"Huge delays in delivering orders >180 minutes. Restaurants need to remake order because it goes cold and still there are delays in delivery.
Over-priced delivery fees for the quality of service. Poor communication with customers."
175486,my only complaint would be that I was unable to leave any directions for the delivery. Sat nav always sends you to another property and it would have saved the driver phoning me for directions
112481,"Quick, reliable and professional service."
111151,"Great hob well worth the money, delivered on time and easy to install."
159786,The website was very clear and specific and guided me to exactly what I needed. The foods arrived promptly and the installation instructions were perfect and the install went very smoothly. I am very pleased with the outcome

188891,"it took longer than I expected, but it was over Christmas and various postal strikes"
149177,"I sent my phone for trade in over 17 days ago, they lost the device and refuse to generate the funds promised on the basis that it takes 5 days to investigate (it’s been over 12).
When you call you get a terrible response, they promise to call back, chase up and investigate, none of which works.

I’ve called over 6 times, they seem totally unwilling to help.

Please avoid at all costs, totally totally not worth the grief, at this point I’m not sure how I’ll get my money (or phone) back, real shame since I wonder how they’d act if I didn’t pay they for 20 days.

Really don’t reccomend trading with them in any instance."
139515,"Memory was dispatched propmtly and communication was gòod. Customs refused the memory and sent it back to mr memory. They contacted me to say it had been returned by customs and that they would send it by courier. It arrived two days later and works perfectly and easily installed after watch the install guide. Great company, thank you for all your help."
174695,"Terrible experience, Don't waste your money.
I bought a Indesit fridge freezer 14 yrs ago and I was advised by the salesman to take out a master care plan insurance. The idea is stress free repairs or product replacement. Fourteen years later Indesit informed me no parts available anymore and referred me back to Currys. Nine long phone calls later and 2 weeks further on no closer to resolve.You get dropped calls or excuses.Promises of call back which never happen.Twice they coudn't find my policy and close to the point of rippng it out of the kitchen and taking it down to Currys and put it on the service department counter. Save your money and don't trust Currys master care insurance. I would have given 0 stars if I could have a choice."
168532,"don't use this company unless you want a whole heap of being pissed off!
ordered a phone on 9th January 21 which they said would be delivered in 7-10 days, 3 weeks later still no phone so cancelled order and requested a refund at the end of January 21, they said 14 days for a refund, they now say 16th March - they wont budge on this date - totally unacceptable"

154163,"I bought a mobile internet service that began to have problems on the third week. I went back to their shop and they told me that it's a sim card that works as a phone card that was being used as mobile internet and the signal could break. However, they wouldn't be able to help me. I'd have to call them. And I did.
The first call was to cancel the contract, but I had to give a 30 day notice. So I did.
The internet service became awful and I had only a few hours a day it'd work, but I never knew when.
I am a remote worker. So this was hell.
I called again. After having been transferred three times, the last person who I was having to explain it all over again for the third time, told me I'd have to reset the router. ""After all these weeks, don't you think I have already tried that?"" I asked her.
I just wanted to cancel the notice time so I wouldn't pay for a faulty service that makes it impossible to work with.
I just got very upset and hung up the phone."

WOW...wish I'd researched this before!!!
I've just tried 4 times to get through to VIRGIN MEDIA...very frustrating and my query and questions left unanswered. Pathetic one had to get through to the Philippines or South Africa or India and have to repeat parrot fashion over and over ...be ignored asking questions and in general GET NOWHERE after 4 calls!!!
I'm asking how to UPGRADE not waste my time !!! U SHOULD DO BETTER VIRGIN MEDIA!!!!!"
155540,Couldn't believe how quick the process was and that it literally arrived the next afternoon even though I ordered late on a Sunday evening.
197551,Good prices. Came quickly. Good customer services.
172436,"this company are the worst that i have ever had dealings with Totaly incompetent useless staff and engineers lying fob off artists a payment of 1p would be 2p overcharge for what you will receive
If you wish to help David then do as your company said and remove all charges for the service that was never given and reply here where others can see wht this company are about"
162033,"Excellent service. Professional, hard working tradesmen - did exactly what they said they would do!"

Profit n tech changes before people even those with problems that I thought laws protected.
Argos like way to many are."
118234,"Perhaps the price is the only gripe, but i got exactly what i asked for. So it's only a minor niggle. Especially since i bought on line and payed a little extra to ensure i got something good. So perhaps my gripe is that their standards are so good, that i could have saved myself a tenner and go for the next product by condition rating... As i would still have been very happy and got something i would have been more than happy with. :)"
183342,"Insurance not worth the paper its printed on.
My terminally ill mother has been has paid an insurance for over 15 years. Her machine breaks down several times over the last year. It's an old machine now.

This company are offering an awful service.
Shows no respect for their customers"
145817,Brilliant service. Paid me what was promised within a day of receiving the phone.

140796,Always had great experience with Studio always get orders within 1 week unless out of stock which is very rare
159618,"Awful customer service. If you finally get through to someone they inevitably can't help and they transfer you to someone else, who also can't help you so they transfer you to someone else etc.. Telephone lines are awful or you get cut off. I've had a number of broadband deals/orders that I've agreed on cancelled without notice. Even when I wrote a letter of complaint and spoke to someone who was supposed to resolve my issues, the resolution we agreed on (which involved a new account and new deal) was cancelled without notification after a waited in for 5 hours for an engineer. When I telephoned them I was again passed from department to department and no-one could tell me why it had been cancelled.
I've tried to join other providers but they keep telling me there's an 'open order' with TalkTalk and they can't do the switch until that order is closed. Needless to say, when I contact TalkTalk I get passed from department to department and no-one can help.
😠😠😠"

197412,"I ordered Now Broadband on the 1st of April and was supposed to get online by the 15th and today it is the 27th. NowTv has done nothing but lies, wasted my precious time. People who order NowBroadband definitely should reconsider."
123791,Put together a remembrance book for the family of an old footballer & they were delighted with the quality & reproduction. Easy to compile but a real treat for them.
144864,"Can highly recommend, good quality batteries delivered quickly will purchase again."
193886,"very good and happy
memory was good and worked fine no problems
delivery was very slow, not as displayed on web site eBay making it up saying 7 days more like 4 weeks.
Said buy from UK not true ORDER from UK, ship from the Netherlands ."
145828,"First time I've needed to call out on my insurance apart from bad timing over the Christmas period. I was seen as promptly as possible and the engineer was very professional, polite and informative. Thank you for my repair x"
115388,The app is pretty straight forward and lays everything out that you need to know. I love that they even have free missions to do.
105086,"Do not ever buy anything from this company.
Worst company I've ever had the misfortune to deal with. Phone stopped working after 2 months and couldn't get them to fix it or refund me. Customer service shocking, different person answers email each time and there is no option to phone. Gave 3 or 4 different reasons why they couldn't fix it then after they had had the phone for 3 1/2 months they told me the screen was cracked and tried to charge me then sent back phone to me when I refused to pay. Fortunately my credit card company (Nationwide, a brilliant company!) refunded me in full."
121766,Sold my old phone to them and all worked very well. Money arrived in my account quickly.
151899,The call back was very quick. The agent knew how to solve my issue with Smartflex. I was given a code and the agent waited while I used it to complete my Smartfkex application.
170436,"Good price, free delivery and delivered at selected time, definitely use again"
166127,i bought the izotope everything bundle and none of the serial numbers worked. they all said that they were already used by another computer.
174930,"Bought an x box one for my son’s birthday, 4th large purchase from music magpie, controller & console very dirty, batteries have previously leaked inside controller, very poor presentation, controller also cracked & one of the tabs inside has snapped off the battery cover, on the plus side it does all seem to work ok? But for how long, tried contacting customer services but links etc don’t work & there is no phone number! Very frustrating, don’t know if I’ll bother buying anything else from them, I’m backed into a corner as I need this now as a birthday present so can’t send it back!"
164873,I bought a mac charger which unfortunately was not compatible with my mac. Therefore had to return. Delivery and return process was smooth and easy and i got full refund. It was great experience.

I ordered a playstation 5…dispatched…DISAPPEARED .. no option to contact BT no phone for sales, no email…chat will not help me

Courier has now gone on strike so cant even contact them

The level of incompetence is shocking

I AM SO ANGRY WITH BT

this was a gift… you cretins

Will wait 48 hours before contacting my bank to tell them my money has been stolen"

131025,"Competitive price, good choice of battery and pack size. Delivery was quick."
130191,"Purchased a clock radio. The display on shelves all over the place with prices not the same as those at till hence charged a different price. Customer assistant more concerned with gathering data so I can be bombarded with adverts rather than actually telling me price BEFORE purchase!
When I said the price was different they wouldn't give me a refund or the difference and just gave me a load of waffle. I had to go to customer services who again said they couldn't do anything so I saw the manager who thankfully sorted out paying me the difference. It was only £5 but it's the principle, they really can't just not bother not changing the prices on the shelves and hoping customers aren't going to notice or complain!"
143255,"The worst company ever
Placed an order broadband twice and twice was cancelled and no one bothered telling me. I was lucky contacting them and asked if everything is OK with my order and they said both orders were cancelled but they couldn't find a reason why. One of the agents that i was talking on the phone said no worries i will place the order over the phone and after 2 days someone called me and said the 3rd order was cancelled too. Unbelievable"
146268,"Customer service is very poor.

Takes months to respond to emails and complaints and when they do, responses make no sense. We are left without functioning router and still having to fight and take to ombudsman to end contract without penalty.

Don’t be a cheapskate - pay a tiny bit extra and go with a decent provider!"
150951,"Great customer service, throughout purchase and delivery."
153462,"I've been a Vodafone business customer for over 20 years, and a ""one net"" virtual landline customer for 10 years. they used to provide a decent service but has gone seriously down hill in the past few years, no just a bit but so far down hill the business team is now underground in hiding somewhere, I could go on but in a nut shell, you used to get a dedicated business manager / team and now you get patched through to a call centre somewhere around the globe, spend hours on hold and never ever actually speak to anyone who can do anything at all, repeatedly. I need a virtual land line service so if anyone knows of any other providers that can do this please let me know, I'll be off in a heartbeat!"
129541,Great choice 😊 once I had chosen staff member was very helpful. Polite and efficient service and very happy with my new TV. Thank you.

Driver was superb"
177364,"Been with VF 12 years and from originally being a good company to deal with they seem to be on a mission to how low they can go. Gone from being customer focused to VF focused both in store on line via app through their useless Tobi everything is to make life as easy for VF and seemingly as much of a pain in the backside for their customers. Like most companies these days they badger you with taking a survey after dealing with them which I now don’t bother with as nothing improves and when C/s used to be ok they never did surveys.
I have to many examples of bad service to mention so all I will say is if you’re thinking of switching to VF think again. I couldn’t give them 0 so 1 flatters them."
144823,Worst streaming service! I’m sorry but for the money they charge they ask extra £5 for HD?! Are you taking a mick! Others been offering HD for years for no extra charge! And most give you 4K included when available. It’s like still asking people to pay extra for the privilege of using 3G those days when it’s so basic it’s a bare minimum!
176348,"Recommended by our son as he was pleased with his recent purchase of a washing machine. Went to a few stores to compare before deciding Marks offered the best value for money. Ordered on line. Process was straight forward. We ordered delivery for the following Sunday as this suited us best. We were given a time slot the evening before and were telephoned as promised when they were half an hour from our home. A big Thank you to Andrew and Owen. They were polite,respectful and efficient. We booked for the disconnect,connect and disposal option which was hassle free for us. Would recommend Marks Electrical."
118830,"Terrible data coverage in my area. Keeps popping up showing ""no internet connection"". Spoke to them to try and resolve ,got nowhere. Asked if I could leave but they told me I'd incur penalties, so I'm stuck with a very poor network for another 6 months. This has been going on for months. Surely they're in breach on contract."
147331,"Brilliant service, went in store for a new phone and wanted to get a better deal than my last one, and got exactly that! Thanks"
156737,"The subscription and payment has already started, but never know when someone will come to repair the washer dryer machine. This means that paying two years subscription costs more than buying new machine with two years warranty!"
103183,"Excellent service, the batteries as advertised and delivered speedily."
197661,"There is no reminder for billing. If you forgot to check your pass expiry date. There is no billing information, except you check your bank account. They will suck your bank account without notification. This is an unfair practice."
128985,Great product easy and user friendly
168724,Mr Memory delivered my Mac Mini memory upgrade cards overnight. They were the right ones for the computer (Identification of the correct item is easy on the website) and they have transformed it from a painfully slow machine to one that performs its tasks very quickly. Removing the back cover of the computer was the only problematic task - I was never more glad to have undertaken an upgrade.
195555,"Fast shipping, good communication, thanks"
191924,The store itself is OK. but the car not. My purchase cost me an extra £50.00. A fine for overstaying the 2 hour limit. I wont be back again.
174310,"I was attracted by the special offer of a Gtech cleaner with a hand held unit for cleaning cars plus additional brushes, which were normally sold separately. Battery powered means no trailing flexes. Reassured about power of battery and the length of time the charge lasted; 40 mins for cleaner and 20 mins for car cleaner. Bonus was the one hour charging boost that gave enough power to finish your job if you ran out of power.
Lightweight and easy to handle. the small K9 unit was ideal for stairs. No danger of cleaner falling off steps as you worked up the flight. Powerful suction with battery power. Different brushes easy to change.
Cleaner is able to reach under furniture and is easily steered across open floor area.
Easily dismantled for clearing blockages. More frequent emptying of dust bag is required, but the operation is simple.
On balance ticks all the boxes and I would recommend the cleaner."
190139,I have never received the goods I ordered and I have not received my money back. GHD have not answered my emails. Awful company to deal with won’t attempt to purchase from them again
128569,Great service! I had so many reputable reply’s & got the urgent job done! Highly recommend and will definitely use again! ****
182679,If no stars were available Shell would get that for an abysmal service. Have been overcharged by 1000kwh since April. Ignores the meter readings and photos I send but uses faulty smart meter readings.Complaint now with energy ombudsman but all Shell has said is they will investigate. How long do you need to put your error right??? 8 months and no resolution with bills STILL showing wrong readings. Wish I could switch.
144843,"I needed two 8gb RAM cards for my iMac, and saw that Mr Memory had the best prices available. I checked trustpilot for reviews and almost all were hugely positive so I ordered them through the Mr Memory website. Suffice it to say, the reviews on trustpilot are entirely accurate - memory arrived very quickly, safely packaged, and with clear instructions for how to install. So far worked perfectly, with noticeable improvement to how my computer runs. All at a great price. Really couldn't ask for better, and couldn’t recommend highly enough!"

Would recommend"
168338,"Excellent. Good communication (both phone and website), schedules met, expectations exceeded."
121631,"Team knowhow / curry's are an utterly shambolic company to deal with should anything not go entirely to plan. You pay for installation and they send unskilled delivery men to shrug and tell you you get a plumber. Once plumber has been, they then tell you they'll come back out and give you a time slot. Guess what, they've already missed that time slot without any phone call to explain why. When you call their phone lines you are greeted with an assault course of automated checkpoints and when you finally get through they are rude and hang up. I wouldn't wish this customer service on anyone.

Update - The installation didn't come, they thought they could get away with marking it as complete and forged my signature, which I'm pretty sure is illegal. I will be taking this to trading standards."
189005,"Absolutely fantastic service. Oven stopped working Christmas day( nightmare) so ordered part on the 27th and it arrived before new years eve, so party food was sorted.

115746,Equipment from Sonos excellent staff good in general but I asked them if the power lead from the Sonos one fits the Sonos 5 they said yes it does so I didn’t buy longer leads gets home went to set it up leads to short so had to go out and buy longer ones so a little annoying.
193001,"recently had a couch delivered. really happy with the service i live in an upper flat and the guys brought it upstairs without me having to ask really appreciated it. they were quick and efficient. have always been a loyalty customer over the years and will continue to be , very reliable and you know what you’re going get with argos :)"
119486,"Unfortunately BT seem to have very few people who can connect my services since moving home.
Despite numerous phone calls they still cannot arrange to connect my broadband.
They sent my original home move order to a different address and then they kept passing me to the wrong department who all eventually cut me off on the phone. 15 to 20 long phone calls later and the problem still isn't fixed. I am not sure if this is the same BT that I used to enjoy as they have now merged with EE. The service is truly shocking and to call it a service would be a vast over exaggeration. Take a tip whoever reads this. Take your business elsewhere because there are much better companies out there sadly 😥."
113848,"Very helpful knowledgeable staff , able to answer any questions I had and also very friendly."
110547,I have been a hairdresser for forty years and ghd Helios dryer has produced the best results in terms of time saved and finished results.a little pricey but a great buy .... love it
179361,"Avoid at all costs. Months of no internet, hours on the phone followed by inability to cancel leading to paying for 2 accounts for months. Never experienced such a poorly run company. Took 5 months to sort and contacting our bank to reclaim double payments and financial ombudsman to finalise. Ridiculous."
128445,"Easy to order through the website - good communication regarding delivery and delivered exactly when promised
However I probably won't buy from you again if you continue to bombard me with calls (which I don't answer) from your insurance sales team!
This activity turns 5 stars into 1!"
186536,You lot have just had my mother in tears. Her account is now in overdraft and she's been sent to a dca for an account she told you to cancel 2 months ago. No matter what she does you immediately send her to the DCA instead of checking notes on the account. Your customer service and phone service in general is garbage. I will never use 3 again and neither will she. Scum is the word that comes to mind.
167105,Broadband is good until it stops working. There is no way to speak to anyone. They just send you round in circles pointing you at their blog so that their own customers can try and fix the issue.
153250,I am still waiting on a item from studio from the 15th Nov been with evri from the 17th nothing from evri xmas just round the corner very anxious 😟
112181,"**UPDATE**
Received the phone back from CPW today and powered it up only to notice that it does have visible signs of screen burn but I am 99% sure that this was not present before sending it to CPW for a trade in. I am disgusted if this has been damaged while in their possession. I guess I will never know the truth but what I do know is is that CPW don't seem a very reputable company from the reviews I have read. I will never use them again.

I wanted to trade-in my Google Pixel 3a and had a great offer from Carphone Warehouse of £70. I should have known it was probably too good to be true and after reading many other reviews of people experiencing the same issue and I now feel that I am yet another victim of their trade-in deal. They give you a great quote to draw you in - you post your phone off in great condition and fully working order to then receive an email saying that their engineers have found a fault, in this case, screenburn and would you accept £15 or ask for the phone to be returned. I sent my phone to them in A1 condition with no problems, without even a scratch - it was faultless. I have asked for the phone to be returned to me in the same condition that it was sent but I have little hope of hearing anything back from what I have read elsewhere. Utterly appalling behaviour!! Please could a representative of Carphone Warehouse please contact me to resolve this issue before I take matters further and speak to my solicitor. Thank you."

Even more annoyed to receive this after not long ago I was told Virgin was increasing my broadband speeds free of charge as a thank you to it's loyal customers. Well thanks for the kick in the teeth virgin. This also comes pretty much straight after us having no broadband services for 2 days due to a fault in the area. Unbelievable."

121619,I ordered a samsung s21ultra which came with samsung earbuds and a smart tag from their website on the 28th. They processed my order the next day on the 29th.. which meant I did not qualify for the free earbuds as the promotion ended at midnight on the 28th. When I contacted their customer services and they basically said unlucky we can't amend your recept with the correct date of purchase. This means I can't claim the free earbuds. I asked to speak to a manager and was told she would call me back which they haven't. Shocking customer services. Looks like I'll be returning the £1100 pound phone I brought from them and taking my custom elsewhere.
163785,Brought a P30 mobile of the carphone werehouse should of came with the free gift freelace earphones they never sent the free gift when asked they said it was subject to stock I brought the mobile as soon as the deal came on its false advertising to get you to buy the phones
110365,Takes phone numbers from websites then provides them to others looking for work. Is this even a genuine company? Waste of time for everyone.

169011,"Company expected me to pay an extra £12.99 after already paying just shy £300 in one week because ""Minimum payment had not been made"". Which as you can probably see £300 is 23x greater than £12.99. The lady I spoke to on the phone was rude, arrogant, abrasive amd ovwrall a complete tw@t. Fu¤king bullsh¡t. Needs to go insolvent."
101588,Polar watch of excellent quality and strong battery promptly sent.
196518,"Very unpleasant service since I first joined. Just to get my old number transferred over to vodafone took about 4 weeks to sort, which meant I had no working phone number to use during that period. Customer Service were very rude and unhelpful. When I told them that I did not have a working phone number due to their error, I was rudely asked why I do not own a landline. Every time I called to get this issue sorted, I was told it would be sorted in 24 hours. 4 weeks and the same thing kept happening every single day. Cannot express how rude, unhelpful and incompetent their service teams came accross. Finally my case was escalated to the customer complaints department, who managed to get my sim card working. It took me submitting a complaint just for my sim card to start working.

Now, all I want to do is to purchase a roaming bundle (also disappointing that roaming is not included in their standard package as it is for most other providers), the app keeps saying that it had an issue and I cannot even open it. I try to access my account online to make sure I can pay for additional roaming before I leave the country, and I cannot access it due to their multi-factor authentication not actually working. I cannot even log in. Tried using webchat instead, and I am unable to get passed the chat bot, it keeps pushing me out of chat when I ask to chat to an advisor. My only option will have to be to call their support line again, which is something I hoped to never have to do again. Even when trying to give them more money, their service is failing.

Needless to say, I would not recommend vodafone to anyone looking for a new mobile service provider. No offer under the sun would be worth the headache of trying to use their service."
129225,"Great service, great price, great delivery, great products. What's not to like ? Happy days."
130773,"this is a disgrace of a company!!!!!!

I have had no problems with this company for 3 years and my service is very good and i went to renew my package it stated that i could no longer get service in my area.

So i tried to contact them for over a month, if you try to ring them it doesn't go through to anyone! no matter on whatever line or number you try.

online doesnt let you renew at all,In my opinion all this is a way of getting you to a higher charge rate until you go try a fix the issue.

After 3 days of trying to talk to someone on live chat i got someone named ryan who never listened to anything i said when i asked for the same package from what i seen online you told me to go online and get it!! after me explaining that it wouldnt let me and after all the issues i have had.

Ryan couldnt care in my opinion until i mentioned i was going to be doing a review,to which he said this issue was all my fault and i did this and that wrong etc.

i asked how was this my fault whenever i rang up and no one picked up and he never answered the questions he asked and how was it my fault also when on my offers section on my account,it wouldnt let me renew?

after proven ryan wrong he said he would get a manager to contact me in the next 24/48 hours"
146059,"Spoke to a man called kayden
Got to say the most helpful person ever,absolutely excellent and a credit to the company very informative and great manner about him. Give the man a pay rise"
126755,"Like so many others below the customer service experience is atrocious. People rating 5 stars for complaint resolution are either fake or just obviously neglecting the fact they had cause to complain in the first place. Surely that should knock at least one or two stars from the overall experience.

Personally Ive found myself with a complaint dragging on for most of 2022 after a simple question over how the usage estimates where calculated. Having cut my electricity by over 50 percent compared to the previous year I'd seen a credit balance accumulating. Their own team actually acknowledged their billing algorithm was incorrect in my case but despite this continued to keep increasing the fixed payment to almost quadruple the initial payment.

I cancelled my fixed direct debit and asked them to set up a variable one.

After several months (whilst the credit balance was consumed) the first actual payment should have gone from my account just before Christmas. They even showed it as having done so but my bank account failed to show any such payment leaving or pending. Today I received notification that my direct debit had been cancelled.

The actual situation which is more likely (and seems to be confirmed with the bank) is that they never actually set up a new mandate.

Around an hour on the phone to some poor English speaking support team representative in a very noisy office and got nowhere.

Now I'll be hit with increased pricing due to being a non DD customer. Seems somewhat unfair that they benefit further from their short comings."
105176,This five star review is for a BT employee who has gone above and beyond to help resolve a fault with my landline that has been ongoing for nearly three weeks. If it wasn’t for this employee it would have been a one star review. The employee is called Owen Stockley who is a credit to BT and the only person who has done anything regarding this fault.As far as I am concerned he should be given a pay rise if not a promotion. Thank you Owen exceptional customer service.

Last year my business was without telephone for over a week and there is no apology, no refund, nothing, there is virtually no chance of speaking to a person, I've just been on the phone in a queue today and after a few minutes the bt system just cut me off.
I'm now on whatsapp in another qeue, I've had no phone and no broadband at my business its been 24 hours and I cant even report it as the online system does not accept my account number and wont progress the fault, I cant report it on my phone as its conflicting with my home bt app and wont let me report it, its seriously putting my business at risk but yet I cant speak to anyone but for a robot telling me how to test my internal socket - every year we have this, whilst writing this I've just been notified they cant help me on whatsapp as theyre too busy my message tells me a few options one is to ring the help line and I've been passed back to that- another two minutes and Ive got engaged tone and been cut off !!!! so thats my morning gone - and my business following shortly - hold on a response
whats app has replied - I have someone to help!
Genuinely - I've just had a call from my staff at the same time an engineer turned up to the estate apparently all the lines are down and have been down 24 hours and someone got through yesterday, so it seems an engineer can get to site quicker than help can answer the phone in some cases !"
113585,It still has not arrived despite being due before the 5th december. It doesnt really matter if its good because i missed the birthday it was for. Really dissapointing as i chose this brand because of the fast dispatch.

104039,"I'd like to leave a review as Team Know How has always been extremely professional and helpful with all my appliances. The repair engineers are knowledgeable, and the customer service agents, are helpful (maybe sometimes you need to insist, but always get the result). On Saturday, they replaced my dishwasher, and taken the old one. For some stupid reason, I forgot the hot plates of my electric grill inside. I called them, and they said they will see what they can do, but no promises, as the appliance is already taken. This morning, I got the hot plates back through my front door. I cannot tell how grateful I am for the professional and friendly service. THANK YOU"

189717,Appalling service. I had to call several times to get a simple job done. Every time I asked to speak to a manger I was advised that a manager will call me back within 24 hours. This happened about 4 times and I never received a call back. It has been over a month since I asked for the first call back and I'm still waiting.... I have also tried to raise several complaints but no one has ever called me back or offered me any form of compensation in relation to these. I would strongly urge people to stay away from carphone warehouse. Their customer service is APPALLING!
193923,"Awful, never any signal can’t even make a phone or a text not recommend😡"
188418,Arranging for the engineer to come was hassle free and easy. On the date of my repair the engineer was prompt and arrived with all the tools and parts he required. I'm very happy with the service.
173867,"We purchased a deck amp and speakers earlier this year from the Sheffield branch. Although happy had terrible feedback. Phoned and they said to bring it in and they would have a look at it. Took them in today and was dealt with by Geoff. He hooked everything up and yes the feedback was there. Tried it with another deck and no feedback!! Hurrah, we ultimately upgraded the deck and speakers too with ours in PX. Highly delighted and cant wait for the new deck to arrive. They are even loaning us speakers as new ones wont arrive until after Christmas. Excellent service, thank you Geoff for your fantastic service and advice. Merry Christmas to you all ."

Work was done to satisfaction."
137226,"In all my life I've never experienced a company as bad as this. I actually didn't think it possible for a company to be this inept. It would be funny if they hadn't wasted so much of my time and patience. This is my 3rd bad review of this company, after they failed to deliver my wahsing machine 3 times. That's right, 3 times. First time they came two hours too early and then blamed me for not being in, then patronised me when I called to sort it. Second time I called to make sure it was coming and they said they've put the delivery back a few days, without notifying me. Third time, they put it back again, with no explanation and with clear inclination as to when it might arrive. The order had to be cancelled as Team Knowhow are just so useless. This company even existing is proof that some people just fail upwards and succeed despite having nothing to contribute, to anything."
137668,"Once again a superb performance from FFX!
Ordered Friday afternoon and delivered on Saturday lunchtime.
I have ordered several times from FFX and always the same great service"
113644,Ordering was great no issues at all and the lad was really helpful but the delivery drivers made a huge song and dance about having to bring the cooker in the front door because they had to “wheel” it round the house. Made me uncomfortable considering I had paid for delivery. They made me feel like I was in the wrong when they just couldn’t bring it In the back door

164603,"Broadband is not consistent, good service followed by periods where there is little to no bandwidth at all. So far in several tests the average is less than 100mb. Mostly averaging less than 40mb. The 600mb unicorn has never been seen! Your reporting process is so complex that it’s easier to use this process to inform you of my experience, vs. Trying to complain about how poor the service is at present. Last 2 weeks have been exceptionally poor, your website states “perfect service no issues”. Which is not true! Having to join conference calls using my mobile service is hardly a good broadband experience!

Update: I have worked in the IP networking and Wi-Fi market for 30 years, the issue is the broadband bandwidth coming into the router, no t the placement of the router.itself. The issue is intermittent again pointing to either a) problems or b) over subscription on your broadband infrastructure. Yet your website will not admit issue, so it must be over subscription! Either way your service does not deliver 100mb let alone the 600 mb I pay for! Give me the service you charge for!"

No return email for either the pickup or return have been received. The courier delivering the new order picked up the return said I would get a notification for the return, which I have not. I tried to contact Very as it has both orders in my account. Unable to contact them via the my account app, phone they are just taking automated payments at this time. I tried to email (unable to leave email address in here) and this was returned as undeliverable. I rang their head office number 0844 292 1000 this does not connect either. This has been really poor service and I am not planning on continuing keep an account with them. To top if off I have paid delivery as well for the wrong item.

'We don't deal with this, it's a manufacturers issue' was the explanation before I was passed to Beko. Beko were incredibly unhelpful. The guarantee is with obviously with TeamKnowHow because it's them who sent the reminder. TeamKnowHow don't want to take responsibility, so where do I go now?"

I managed to order it again when once again I had an email saying back in stock another month later ordered cancelled again!!!, as I was told they don’t know when they will be getting it in stock even thought I rang a local store and they said they have ordered some in. They don’t have a clue, very unhelpful, and very rude, not the way to run a business!!."

I telephoned to ask if Nectar points had been applied. I was told to take my Nectar card when I came to collect it.

I did but an uninterested fellow chatting told me to go away and look at the invoice.

Nothing was shown on the invoice.

They clearly have no proper customer service and their staff have no interest in helping anyone.

160447,"Update 17/01 finally refunded amount to card after credit card company got involved .

Update today 06/01 refunded amount from my credit card company
Update 03/01 still no refund !! Even after countless emails and messages promising my refund of £185.99
Update 18/12 still no refund as promised , lies , lies , lies terrible company
Update 09/12 still not refund and constantly chase . As per reply no one has called me what a load of rubbish total lies .
Order Reference: 6302899
Parcel Contents Note Number: 899014
This is the worst company ever please do not order or waste your money with this company.
I placed an order on the 28th of November and the total amount came to £206.
Not only did they take the £206 from my account but they also took another £185
Without my consent or authorisation I’ve been fighting ever since to get their money back every day I’ll call them I’ve sent about 10 to 20 emails and messages in all it’s absolutely hopeless. Tonight was the final straw really I spoke to an advisor who couldn’t speak English or communicate with me properly.

I am unable to buy Christmas presents with my account credit card as I already owe money as they took money which they shouldn’t of.

This is basically theft I keep asking them to return the money that they owe me And they keep staying they will but they never do or they say they don’t know the money or they say I’m gonna have a delivery then I’m not going to have a delivery. Absolute incompetence.

Also I don’t have a credit account with them and I don’t believe in it at all the APR is 39% and praise on vulnerable and poor people who can’t afford a Christmas I have no idea why they need to have the APR so high especially in times like these where it’s really hard financially for families.

The customer service is appalling the delivery service is appalling and the online enquiries all over the phone is absolutely disgusting save you any go to the shops do not buy from this company.
They should pay me compensation for the fifth of money from my credit card which was not authorised, to the interest that I have to pay on this amount, to the inconvenience and the constant telephone calls messages and emails that wasted my time and energy. I found the whole experience extremely stressful and upsetting shame on you studio. I’ve even reported this to my credit card under section 75 but it takes time."
179579,They take your bank card details and keep charging you after you cancel. You can't contact them and you can't cancel the payment with your bank as it's not a DD. DONT USE THIS COMPANY.
153923,"I’m a Vodafone customer for a number of years with a 5G unlimited data contract. Just returned from overseas holiday with my partner. He’s with EE. Everywhere we went, my partner got way better reception/speeds with EE than I did with Vodafone. I barely ever got 5G reception. My partner had 5G most of the time. EE overseas fair usage data limit 50gb. Vodafone 25gb. And my Vodafone contract is way more expense than my partners. Vodafone used to be slightly more expensive but it was worth it as they were known for innovation and speed. But your competitors have stormed ahead of you and charge less.

It was not easy as in addition to Joanne, on email and on my mobile, we were also getting Openreach phoning us about work dates on our failing landline, as well as several Openreach personnel and their contractors. The missing part is BT sales who are sending us letters saying Full fibre has arrived on our road, when it patently hasn't! Amid all that Joanne did her best and kept us fully informed and tried to trouble-shoot. It was reassuring that she had our back. So well done."

134117,"As a Vodafone PAYG customer for years now I decided to go monthly with a sim only offer upgrade, like many on here when I tried to put the order through the site which crashes with ""there seems to be a problem"" common issue.
There's a lot of so called'fixes' on the Vodafone forums but to be honest I should not need to go into my phone and browser settings to try and put an order in which going by the dates and comments this issue has been going on for years now and it's more a Vodafone fault.
Tried several times and could not be annoyed with it and decided to try Sky offers and though and behold it was as easy and stress free as ABC.
I've decided not to even try for Vodafone full fibre broadband offer and I'll just renew my Sky broadband and I'm certain I'm not alone here.
Obviously this will get the useless ""we're sorry to hear this"" from the Vodafone social media team but they should redirect their concerns onto their internal emails to their customer complaints and IT departments."

My latest purchase included some heavyweight components so I wanted to make sure I got it right. PC Specialist gave me excellent advice and the forums on their web site was a really great help.

This won't be my last PC I buy and it certainly won't be the last one I buy from PC Specialist. I am always happy to recommend PC Specialist whenever my clients ask advice on where they shoul dgo for a computer.

Their contact number is on a standard 30 min hold and then you don't get the right person so they transfer you. Half the time you get cut off but if they don't cut you off its another 30 mins.
I think over three days I've spend 8 hours on the phone to them. Not good"
120448,"Vodafone and City Fibre have recently had a massive advertising campaign in our area, promising super-fast fibre broadband for half the price. All we have to do is sit back and let them do all the work, from contacting our current (previous) provider to the start of our new contract via Vodaphone. Happy Days... Not!

The guys that came to install it on the 8th of April were polite, but the work they carried out was very amateurish, from having too short a cable to chipping the brickwork, but I will say they tried to fix their errors to an extent that was amicable.

Unfortunately, when they were trying to feed the main box from our property, there was a blockage of some kind. He told us the cable tubing may have collapsed, even though we live in a newly built house, but never mind, they would put a request in for the pavement to be dug up and the matter fixed. We wouldn't need to wait for permission etc from the council, so it should only be a matter of days.

In addition, we talked to Vodaphone while the installation guys were here, and we were promised a call back on the 11th of April. We had to wait for the ""job"" to be entered into the system, and only then could they change the installation date.

The 11th of April: we waited... and waited...I called them in the late afternoon to be told nothing was on the system and they would call me on the 19th of April.

The 19th of April: we waited... and waited...I called them in the evening, after 42 minutes of waiting on the phone to be told that he would call me back on the 20th of April.

April 20th: waited... and waited...I called them in the late afternoon, after 55 minutes, and they said there was still no update and would call me on the 27th.

The 27th of April: we waited... and waited...No phone call.

On the 28thof April, I called after 23 minutes, was told that it had been passed to CityFibre management, and yet again promised a phone call on the 3rd of May.

I decided to just try and see if I could find out what the hold up was, as Vodephone is like my backside when it comes to getting some answers...

(You can see my other TrustPilot review)... So today, on April 28th, I called City Fibres' so-called customer service to be told that there was no logged report, so the matter was with the investigation team and she couldn't give me any other information than that!

One month since signing up and five lengthy telephone calls later, there is no fibre broadband, no nothing! 

Vodaphone blames Cityfibre. Cityfibre hasn't a clue what's going on... The Best of British Customer Service!

Vodafone, if I was to break my contract with you, you would be after my backside in court... Why in the world do you think it's acceptable to treat customers and small businesses like mine with this so-called service... not only breaking the contract, but having no regard for our situation or the damage it can cause to business and family life?

I now know why we have been offered the fibre network at half price!

I will provide an update on this ongoing farce..."

134559,"Avoid Shell Energy! They are an appallingly bad company. They took over as our energy supplier over a year ago and still haven't refunded the money they owe us (i expect this is the case for many of their other customers). They couldn't care less about their customers, rude and unhelpful customer services staff (when you eventually do get through) We've wasted hours and hours of our time chasing the money they owe us only to be fobbed off every time, absolutely terrible, avoid at all costs, there are plenty of other energy suppliers available, see all the other bad reviews online of Shell and you will see that this is not an isolated instance! Disgusting behaviour from a company that made £10 billion in profits in the last quarter alone but refuses to refund £300 that they owe.
It's incredible that companies like this are allowed to get away with it."
148721,"I think that Currys is really the worst company I have ever had to deal with !!!
I am a landlord and one of my tenants notified me yesterday that her washing machine was not working.
As I had paid for both a care agreement, and an extension to it, I telephoned Currys who said that I should call the manufacturer Indesit *(Hotpoint).
I pointed out that my contract was with them but they were insistant so I called Indesit who told me that they had no record of the address where the WM is sited, despite the fact that it was originally delivered there.
They told me to go back to Currys which I did and, after explaining the situation, I was told they had amended their files and that I should go back to Indesit.
To cut a long story short I telephoned both Currys and Indesit several times without success because Indesit said the postcode, that Currys had given them, was wrong twice.
I then emailed Currys head office and a Mr Bell said someone would get in touch with me but they did not do so, despite the several further emails I sent them, informing them of my tenant's distress as she has two children, one of whom is autistic and in nappies, and so for her, a WM is a necessity !
I copied in the CEO, Alex Baldock, who never even bothered to respond, although I could see that he read my all emails !
In the end, I managed to ""chat"" online to Indesit (Hotpoint), who offered me an appointent 9 days ahead, whih is too long, especially since my care plan has a ""7 Day Fix Promise "", which means I should get a voucher for a new machine, if they can't repair it in 7 days.
I am not even sure that their engineer will go to the correct address, as I cannot speak to anyone !
Please beware of Currys and their questionable business practices, which include breaching the Consumer Rights Act !!!
P.S. Update.
I have finally managed to get an appointment with Hotpoint for 1 week's time, by booking an appointment online, and offering to pay them privately. This way, when they telephoned me to confirm it, I was able to speak to someone who then agreed to put it under my care agreement.
No thanks to Currys who STILL haven't been in touch!!
Update: Today I got a text and email from Hotpoint cancelling my repair appointment due to lack of spares !!!"

116323,"I Wish I can give a negative rating for now TV. Its rubbish and during move over they dint retain my old number for many years.. and each advisor said different things and neither I had a active landline nor my old number..and I wasted lot of time chasing them.

DO NOT go for them for switchover especially. I should have seen their forums on the same before placing the order."
175646,"So unbelievably disappointing. Went with them even though they were not the highest offer as I thought I would be using a reputable company. Sent an iPhone mini 12 in PERFECT condition and received an email offering me just under £200 less than originally advised based on a problem with the vibration motor. There was absolutely nothing wrong with my phone, it was in mint condition when I sent it and I actually had it checked over by a local company before sending to mazuma who offered me £30 less than them so ultimately decided to use mazuma, what a mistake. I said I wanted it back but they’ve told me another department will re review the offer, disgraceful service."

I had had advice from a Dyson expert who advised I needed to really ram the foot on hard till it clicked. It’s a pity the brushes aren’t harder wearing as replacing mine every 5 years or so."

Can’t even get our package right and now have the audacity to charge us £900 cancellations fees. Threatening us that we have to pay up if we want to switch or continue with BT to get out of this charge.

You are ROBBING people. Absolutely disgraceful."

103828,I’ve been with Talktalk since 2003 despite numerous offers from competing ISP’s. I have once again signed up for another 18 months of Fibre 65 after being given a deal. I couldn’t refuse. I’ve never had any problems with the broadband service I get from Talktalk so why would I change to another ISP. Thank you Talktalk.

Raised a complaint, it was closed without fixing the issue, raised another complaint and now being told they didn't offer me the price im stating.

after 4 weeks was informed some of the items I chose were no longer in stock... had to change them to get the PC into build.
requested they expedite the order at this stage which they did, received the end of that week, all in all now very happy with my PC.
Only issue for me really is the long lead time, (impatient for my new supercomputer) but they did inform me of this at the time of placing the order."

112899,"0 stars for Shell, 5 Stars from Magdalena…

Magdalena was outstanding after previous terrible experience!

Having called over 5 times in a 3 week period, following a comedy of errors in moving on to a new contract with Shell Energy, Magdalena was the only agent that managed to deal with my issue in an efficient and empathetic manner.

Details were lost across all communications, clearly the systems in place are sub par - was supposed to move onto a new contract at a fixed price and was then charged with an out of contract price, called up to query and was offered a free credited month (which was never applied); I then got offered a further discount as a result of the error and a contract entered and issued via email… only to receive a subsequent bill stating I was in arrears and further charges reflecting an out of contract price!

Fast forward to 4 phone calls later, numerous back and forths with incompetent staff and being passed around multiple times resulting in over 5 hours of call time, I received another out of contract charge, so simply cancelled my direct debit (as I believe customers should not be penalised for company wrong doing)

Magdalena called from retentions, actually listened to my issue (which nobody else had done previously) and resolved within 10 minutes.

Overall, 5 stars for Magdalena’s work and 0 stars from Shell Energy in terms of customer experience."
188784,"Just been another Victim of miss selling by virgin mobile. Thought my order was correct until the order conformation came through by email. They tell you what you want to hear on the call to win the sale but then deliver something else. Wouldn't care if I didn't already have my cable, landlines and 2 other mobile contracts with them. Oh the call centre operators are rude beyond comprehension too for a sales team. Guess I get my family discount though, just a pity they are to give me a lower spec handset to make up for it. So I will cancel the order and no doubt have another credit search against me, thanks Virgin you utter Charlatains."

187060,Phone was advertised as including lightning headphones. Phone came quickly and in good condition but with no headphones. I contacted customer services and after around 5 emails back and forth they offered to give a refund of just £5 since the headphones were out of stock. I asked for a greater refund since the headphones are worth £30 but this was refused in several badly worded emails. They then emailed me saying the headphones would be dispatched that same day since they had come back in stock. This was over 2 weeks ago now. I emailed 2 days ago asking when they would be dispatched and all they told me was that I would get an email when they had been dispatched. Overall the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I am still yet to receive any form of compensation for the missing headphones after 3 weeks and a total of around 20 emails back and forth.

The website was very intuitive and informative, leading me smoothly to the LaCie SSD that I selected. The payment and delivery process was transparent and straightforward. I elected to pay extra for the next day service, delivery being effected as promised. I should add that the packaging was strong and protective so that the item arrived in perfect condition. I'm not a first time Ebuyer customer and found, as before, that the prices are reasonable. It's not possible to compare prices on this purchase as Ebuyer was the only company I could find which stocked it."

124936,"Avoid the staff named Munir Mamo in Kingston Upon Thames 3 store please, otherwise you will have a lot of troubles from the phone, the contract and unexpected bills. I went to this store a month ago for a phone upgrade, this staff spent more than 3 hours to do this service. I thought he was a new staff and sat there patiently to allow him complete this simple service with plenty of time, I could not remember the exact time I went into the store but I remember I have not had my lunch yet, I left the store after 5 o'clock without a receipt. On my way home, I still received his phone call to asked quite a few questions. A few days later, I could not use my phone for any thing, I called 3 to find out the problem, the staff found I have used all my mobile data of 1GB , which I requested unlimited data when I upgrade the phone. Munir Mamo confirmed that I was paying for an unlimited mobile data when he do the service. Yesterday, I received total amount of £141.28 for three business accounts which I never requested nor used, and this amount of money already left my bank account. How surprised service! If you want enjoying the network and new phone, please avoid this store and this staff!

I have called the number on reply to look for Ankita who works in business team, the staff could not find her name!
However, I have been calling 3 for different problems in previous a few weeks, also back to Kingston 3 store for a few times, the manager there know about the issue, please contact him if you like to know more details. I have spent too much time for this."

153789,"Terrible company that will fob you off, lie to you and steal from you.

I had a monthly pass which I had cancelled a few months ago, after checking my account I realised that I was still being charged. What I thought would have been a quick call to inform them that they have made a mistake turned out to be hell on earth!

First of all there is no way of contacting this company by telephone if you only have TV services with them, you have to use their online chat service which is abysmal and they just ignore you and end the chat.

When I finally did get through on online chat I was lied to and told that it's a broadband charge so they can't cancel it. I do not have broadband with now TV so that's a lie.
Anyway I called the broadband team who confirmed it was a TV issue so they can't cancel this charge, so went back to online chat and got told it's broadband so can't cancel. Meanwhile I was still being charged for this service that I am not receiving.

Now I understand why they want you to pay by card and not direct debit, because they can just keep taking money without authorization and it's not as easy to just cancel it like a direct debit, this is a scam!

In the end I had to phone my bank to stop any further payments to now TV, the only way they could do this is to cancel my card and send me a new one, so now I have no access to my money for a week.

I can't believe that they lied to me like this and fobbed me off constantly and kept charging me for a service I was not receiving.

Even now they are lying to me by telling me that the charge is coming from my mobile phone company (Vodafone) because when I took out my contract with them they pay for my entertainment pass, this pass is given to me at no cost as part of my mobile phone. Just to rule this out I called Vodafone and they confirmed that the pass I have from them is free of charge for me so yet more lies from now TV. (Also this lie contradicts what they said earlier about it being a broadband charge)
This charge was for an extra pass that I took out but later cancelled as I wasn't using it, the charge clearly said now TV not vodafone. I am absolutely disgusted that this is the way now TV behave and will never do any sort of business with them ever again.

Awful company, please avoid these con artists at all costs"
113842,Very good next day delivery but unfortunately the brush roller was not working properly but after a phone call ai got a replacement part the next day. Working well now.27
190568,"Swift delivery, well packed, all items good."
196973,"Honestly, please do not ignore these reviews - you will regret it.

NowTv make it extremely easy to sign up and also provide some attractive introductory offers. They are very quick to set up the account and take payment for whatever passes you select. This is where the good news stops...

When you try to watch anything, the quality is usually awful - please google nowtv skysports streaming and you will see 18-24 months of problems. Even yesterday they updated their website to show reduced frame rates - which makes the quality and buffering unbareable.

The NowTv stick is a horrible horrible device.... it may seem good value, it may have some great offer (like mine did) but plug it in and it constantly shows up errors (again, please google nowtv stick errors), it always has to ""connect to internet"" if you press any button.... that is like using your mobile phone, but every button you press - you have to check internet connection, its worse than dial-up internet from the early 1990s.

Now if this has not convinced you to use another service, please try and phone NowTV....in order to anticipate how you'll be able to communicate any issues. You cannot speak to NowTv on the phone... only Now Internet. So you have to use their useless 'instant chat' via the website, that takes about 10 minutes to find where to click the link. Then you have someone giving a load of useless information, taking 40 minutes to achieve what could have been done in 3 minutes on the phone.

NowTV do not take your money as a direct debit or standing order, instead its taken as a debit card payment so you cannot cancel it to try and gain an element of control. In my example, I have two passes - SkyCinema and SkySports that I want to cancel - if you press the ""cancel pass"" section on the website, it just refreshes the page and does nothing (a common issue - please google), so you have to use the instant chat to try and cancel anything. However, the advisor cannot cancel your account unless you want it to cancel immediately i.e. if you paid until the 30th of the month and you wanted to cancel on the 15th because its utter dog toffee, then it will cancel the pass immediately and not refund you for what you have lost. Alternatively, you have to message them the day before (if you remember) to try and go through the whole process again and cancel it.

Utter useless, it may seem cheap and look good - its not. I would rather pay more a month for something that works well than get something cheaper that is complete dog toffee"
156741,I'm in the republic of Ireland. I have now tv sports pack since April 2019. I have to say I'm very happy with the service. I got rid of sky. And only have free to air and now tv.

159286,"After moving to nowtv broadband, after first week service drops, I call CS as you would, they booked engineer visit, had to wait 3 days and no engineer showed, I call again get deepest apology and book another visit this engineer did turn up, however did diagnose problem but could not get access to the pole. This engineer puts the job back for another engineer to get access to pole. 8or9 days later I call yet again, where I was again apologised to and a the CS agent said he'd take ownership as at this point I started my complaint, he informed he would call me after the yet another booked engineer had visited he did not turn up 3 no shows by engineers. I call back where another CS booked the 5th engineer visit who finally fixed the damaged line. My complaint is still not resolved the CS tried to offer refund for the month. This has now been at least 8weeks. I get a call from a Gérard a manager from nowtv so I called back, the number he left on my Voicemail, after another 20mins in queue I get told you've called Belfast CS Gérard is in Derry Office, I will email him to call you back, still no call back, I replied to his email asking for confirmation that I refuse the £18 refund offered to appease my complaint, I was offered this £18 refund 6-7weeks. Where I refused and asked for my complaint to be escalated to the next stage as I simply not accepting that after being lied to several times, 3 no show engineers, no service for those 11 days, the contemptuous manner in how they have and are dealing with my complaint. Yet still to hear from Gérard, I'm starting to wonder if this Gérard even exists or is even a Manager. I used to work in a call centre and know that managers are there besty sitting next to them in most cases. Still stalling dealing with the legitimate complaint."
145697,"I was notified of delivery by text/email which was followed up by a telephone call from the delivery driver to confirm expected time of arrival.

Tried lodging a complaint 5 times, spending over 6 hours on call - agents hung up on me each time and never called me back (even after confirming a callback time)

I've never experienced such abysmal customer service, none of the issues I raised were dealt with - they are actively gatekeeping their complaints department.

Worst provider, worst attitude towards customers and an overall catastrophe if needed for any reason. They're only interested in taking your money."

Had a delivery booked in for 17.00 to 21.00 then received text message and email cutting it to 18.00 to 20.00 and confirming the driver would ring up to a hour before delivery.Waited in all evening with a courtesy call coming at 7.28. At 8.43 a text message from Argos tells me driver is approximately 12 minutes away and any issues to call a given number which is the number that made the courtesy call. At 9.15 no delivery and driver ignoring all our calls and texts. No feedback/apology from Argos or driver. I won’t be buying from them again 😖"

145553,"if I could I would rate my experience as 0 stars but it wont let me. I'm not sure of the exact date but prior to the 17th February (3 weeks ago) i reported a fault on my washing machine. An engineer called on the 17th and advised that the reported fault was as a result of Teamknowhow engineers replacing the drum on my machine only weeks earlier and cross threading a screw! I was given a date a week later for another engineer to come to rectify the fault. He came on the 24th February and was unable to fix the machine and suggested that the machine would most likely be written off. And so it begins...on the same day as I was told the machine was written off I received a phone call to confirm my e-mail address. As I had heard no more I called on the 26th February just to get an idea of the time scales involved. The person I spoke to advised that i'd receive a voucher by Sunday 28th February. On the 28th I didn't receive a voucher but i did receive a text at 7:05 on a Sunday morning to advise that the voucher would take 72 hours - I assumed form the time the text was sent? The 28th came and went without a voucher as did the 72 hours following my text.I called again to find out what had happened and was advised that the text actually meant 72 'business hours' and that I'd receive it by the close of business that day. Not surprisingly this deadline came and went and I still didn't have a voucher, I still didn't have a working washing machine but I did have a very large pile/piles of washing. When I spoke to someone on the 4th March they were initially going to raise another voucher to be sent to my e-mail but when I was told that would be a further 72 hours I thought this was unacceptable and asked if there was any way to get it quicker. I was then told they could send it via text assuming my phone had internet capability and this would take 24 hours. Again, after 24 hours nothing had arrived and when i called the particularly rude and unhelpful operative advised that 24 hours wasn't a service they offered and that I should have been told 48 hours and again not actually 48 hours but to allow to the end of business ( to ensure the call centre is shut!) I requested to speak to a manger or supervisor as the situation was beyond ridiculous. I was told there was no supervisors?? Having had issues before I knew this to be untrue and asked that a supervisor call me back. I was told that this had been actioned but that I may have to wait up to 3 working days ( not sure how they calculate this but from Friday 5th March i'd expect that someone might call me by Wednesday 10th March if i'm lucky). I then allowed for the 48 hours to pass and called yet again. After being passed through 3 operatives without success I spoke to someone who said he would request the voucher be sent to a different e-mail address as maybe there was a server issue. He told me he couldnt see any reason to cause a delay and that the relevant department did work weekends and that i should get it in the next 24 hours. You'll not be suprised to know that this deadline came and went and still no voucher. When I rang on Monday 8th March, 3 weeks after the fault was reported and my 6th call, I had still not received the voucher. I was now being told yet again that instead of 24 hours this second e-mail would take until close of business 72 hours from Monday 8th (not even 72 hours from when it was requested). I then asked to log another call back for a supervisor as this was beyond a joke. I was told that there was no call back request from Friday and they were unwilling to put in a further request as they were able to resolve my issues. I'm not sure how they think they've resolved this as I still have no washing machine and they apparently have no way of expediting the vouchers. It shows a high degree of arrogance telling me that escalating the call wont help. I asked what i was meant to do with the ever increasing piles of washing that have been building up over the weeks and there was no answer. I was just told to wait until Thursday morning (72 hours from Monday and the end of the working day-not Sunday when i was told the 3rd lot of vouchers were reissued). We are in the middle of a pandemic, its not like I can go to a friend or relatives to get the washing done. Governments advice says don't leave the house unless you have to and don't go into someone elses house.....


What a joke to see the reply below from Ryan!!!! I've made it blatantly clear that I've not received a voucher, I've made it blatantly clear that I have piles of dirty washing and I've made it blatantly clear that TEAM KNOWHOW KNOW NOTHING!!! This response only proves the point further. They are unclearly unable and/or unwilling to help on any other occasion I've had cause to speak to them I don't know why he thinks it would be any different today."

176861,"I ordered a refurbished iPhone 8 without really looking carefully at the reviews. When it did not arrive after 10 days, I read the reviews and was extremely concerned as many said they waited many weeks, or the phone did not arrive at all. I would like to balance these by saying, I contacted QMF who said it was delayed due to staff shortages because of the virus, and indeed the phone arrived today, 19 days after ordering. The phone is pristine and works perfectly, so despite the extra delay, I am very satisfied. The loss of 1 star is due to the delivery delay."
101409,I haven’t received my parcel yet and have contacted ghd on three occasions to assist me and have still had no reply. Their only method of communication is online form or email. Their phone lines are not working. So at the moment I am very disappointed with the service.
165024,"Seen negative reviews but still went for it. Shipped a perfect iPhone 12 Pro. Which funnily enough I had a brand new screen replaced by apple 6 days before posting the phone. They inspected the phone said it was perfect afterwards. Yet these have found “dust” in my camera and are now offering £300 less to there valuation? The phone was immaculate and fully serviced by apple.

Edit : spoken with customer service. I must be a liar. Cannot provide proof of this dust as it hasn’t been photographed? Yet they have said it is there? I paid £8 to post it next day now they want to hold it until next week minimum??

Second edit : Sold to CEX as an A grade phone… do not waste your time with this company"

I was dealt with by a young man called Tom who dealt with my request for a new phone in a very professional manner, explaining everything in full detail. Tom really knows his job and his customer approach is second to none, I would like to wish Tom all the very best for the future he is a credit to Carphone Warehouse"

136538,"Awful customer service, fob you off with excuses about why the Internet is down. Despite using virgins own app to check and report no local faults several times over 2 days customer services state that they see there is a fault and there is work in the area. This is the second time this has happened in 2 months, have to wait for them to go through excuses and eventually after a few days a technician visits to fix the issue with hub/line into house and you have to pay for the pleasure! The WiFi guarantee is not worth anything, very misleading, waiting now for 2 months for the pod with no refund as states in their advertisement. Then informed me that all managers are working from home due to covid regulations so I couldn't speak to one. Obviously their Internet is working allowing them to do so, perhaps they have a better provider!"

In March 22 it stopped working so just over 2 years from purchase. Part of the warranty remained which was only labour. The parts were only covered for one year. I sent the laptop back which was diagnosed with motherboard failure and new battery and a repair cost of £869!
Just be mindful of the warranty if you are considering this company. I am more concerned that a £1500 laptop did not last more than two years and they hid behind the warranty terms of which was partly still active rather than protect their brand so I cannot recommend."

Been on to their absolutely terrible customer services another 3 occasions, each time a couple of weeks after their made up refund date... still no refund. Just get told a different date then nothing. My advice, bin them, cancel direct debit immediately regardless of what they say and ignore their customer service."

Their idea of there testing is to leave it with them with for an hour And you're at the mercy of their discretion Even if you can get it to do the fault in front of them And they tell me they had no proper way of testing The particular fault on phone So buy them doing this you're left in a limbo of the option to sell the phone back at a less cost a lot less than the curent market value Seems very much like a tactic To get out of it on the cheep"

The app information is also incorrect showing the wrong billing basically making the whole app and smart meter reading totally useless and also very frustrating. I have no issue with paying what I owe, I like to keep all my bills accurate as possible but if they cannot do this with there app and smart meter then what's the point of these devices? Also the horror of not knowing how long the electricity had been estimated has made me instantly search for a new energy provider after what has been years of smooth stress free service from Shell. This is not the time to be playing with people's energy concerns and billing and all I want is a accurate to the penny bill so I can pay exactly what I owe. No more recommendations to family or friends for this company after this experience."

199348,"Delivery:

I bought an iPhone XS 256 GB in pristine condition with the full bundle on 5 of April for £578.99. I actually took a loan from DivideBuy (thanks to God I did that, I will explain it later). Keeping in mind that Coronavirus is around the delivery didn't take that long - 11 days from the date of purchase and I received the phone on 16.04.2020.

Condition of the phone:

When I opened the box the first thing I noticed QMF didn't include a screen protector and headphones even though I paid for the full bundle and it should have been there. When I took the phone I saw some deep scratches on the stainless steel at the bottom left corner. When I turned the phone around I found a small crack at the back of the phone. Again I bought the phone in pristine condition... I switched on the phone and set it up. When the phone was on I noticed that the bezels around the screen seemed to be thicker than on the original screen. I went to the settings and there was no option of true tone (which means that the part was replaced and it wasn't original). I also tried 3d touch which didn't work either. I went to youtube to check the speakers, they were of good quality however on the maximum volume I could hear some distortions of the sound.

The refund process

I contacted QMF and claimed the refund the same day, they sent me the labels for sending the phone back and I did it the same day. They received the phone on 20.04.2020 and on 21.04.2020 they processed it for the refund. They didn't send me the email confirming the refund (it is very important! I wiil talk about it later). I contacted them in online chatbox and they told me that the refund takes 14 working days, so they should have given the money back to DivideBuy by 11.05.2020. However, surprise surprise it didn't happen. I contacted DivideBuy and they asked me to send them an email which confirms that QMF confirmed the refund. I emailed QMF and cc DivideBuy in the conversation and they never replied to this email. Fortunately, I took the screenshots of the conversation and sent them to DivideBuy, so they stepped in and wrote QMF directly. QMF promised them to process the refund by 18.05.2020, yet it didn't happen either.I wrote to DivideBuy one more time and they contacted QMF again. Hence on 19.05.2020, I got an email from QMF that my refund was processed and today on 21.05.2020 I got my money back from the DIvideBuy. I am not sure if I could get money back if I paid QMF directly, DivideBuy helped me a lot in this process. If I were you I wouldn't buy any phone from them, It is my story, hope it helps. I gave 2 stars which is very generous from my side. QMF thank you for giving my money back."

Expecting a delivery of washing machine and fridge freezer on 02/01, for the lazy and rude delivery drivers to refuse delivery on the day, making us wait 5 working days.
On the Friday, once it had been delivered the washing machine looked used and damaged with rust and yellow grime in the drum, which is not what you would expect when ordering a brand new appliance from a so called reputable company such as AO.
Agreed for a collection for Monday for them to turn up saying they thought they were repairing the machine, after a phone call to customer service, this had been a lie, really they had run out of bubble wrap!
Rearranged collection for 12/01 to receive a text the morning before, that its actually been changed with no notification or approval from us, for 11/01. Luckily we are in to accept the appointment.
Hoping they do finally deliver our appliances 13/01 (although they will probably blame it on being Friday the 13th if they don't) which is 11 days after we had expected them to arrive.
It would have been a lot stressfree, collecting and paying for a removal company to deliver- least they know how to do the job right."

156441,"Woeful in every possible way. My wife has ordered a Samsung galaxy s21fe via mobiles.co.uk (all calls have been dealt with by carphone warehouse) over a month ago. We were initially told it was out of stock then after two calls we were told it was despatched. No delivery details were sent. We waited and waited. Still no phone. We called again (every time it's a considerable wait to actually speak to anyone) and we're told it it had been picked up by dpd but they are denying ever receiving it. We specifically asked whether the contract would have started as we still didn't have the phone and was told no it'll only start once the SIM was activated. We were told another phone would be despatched in three to five days. Week and a half later and no contact from mobiles/carphone warehouse whatsoever, no phone and now a bill from Vodafone for the first month of the contract! Another ninety minutes on the phone basically and nothing but a promise of the phone being despatched in another three to five days. That's over a month billed plus the £165 upfront that they took immediately for a product and contract we don't have. No offer to refund the unused contract. No offer of compensation for the hours wasted phoning the call center tracking the product that this company have no interest in. You couldn't make up the incompetence of this company they are truly awful. A CEO complaint will be going their way. Please avoid them at all costs."

134808,"Item description was misleading, I didn't exactly get what I paid for. Tried to resolve the matter with customer service, but they were not able to help (however it would have been very simple). Seems this company is willing to cheat for the sake of a few pounds and not at all cares of customer satisfaction. This was the last time I purchased anything from them.

Update: After getting a nice ""I'll try to resolve your matter message"" from Bekki, I popped a message on social media as it was adviced, but the chatbot just wasted my time again, just as customer service did yesterday. So I have to confirm: AVOID THIS COMPANY! They pretend like they care about the customers, but they don't really help in a single thing once they got your money."

109168,"I have used Now TV for passes for years and never had an issue.
Last year I decided to sign up to Now TV Broadband as I had been with Talk Talk for 3yrs and had nothing but issues.
I have to say, Now TV Broadband was probably the best broadband I've ever had. I only had the WIFI drop once in 12 months and when I called them, they fixed the issue within minutes.

Today I had to cancel my Now TV Broadband contract as I'm moving to Virgin (purely because I can't get any TV channels in my new property unless I have Virgin and it's cheaper to get the package that includes WIFI) but I will miss the smoothness of Now TV Broadband and I will certainly look to use them again in the future. :-)"

Having requested my account was closed in April 2022, I was then informed that I needed to pay 30 days notice and a cancellation fee of 2.5 times the monthly subscription. I was shocked but could not afford the plan going forwards so rang up and requested to pay my account up to date and close it as I had already cancelled the direct debit with my account. Vodafone misinformed me how much was due and therefore underbilled me. 6 months later they put a notice on my credit score. I allegedly owed £15, they made no effort to contact me and insisted I instead attended one of their shops to resolve the issue. This resulted in me taking time off work in order to attend when they were open. The manager kindly resolved it for me and wrote off the late payment fees (£5) however could not do anything about the outstanding bill. My credit score dropped by 100 points and for the sake of £15, it was easier to pay them to go away. I would not recommend them to anyone. I repeatedly made them aware of my personal circumstances and every time I approach them for answers I am left on hold, sent around the houses and receive ridiculous answers. They are not worth the cheaper prices!"

I had my TV deal cancelled due to not having an aerial and was told by the operator at BT that my bill would be £30 a month. As time went by I started to see BT charge me £45 a month. When querying this the operators seem to have no record of the original deal.
I have put in complaints with BT without getting this resolved, At this point I thought to myself I would cancel the contract and just pay the cancellation fee. When trying to do this BT sent me cancellation charge of £316.93. Now i'm stuck with these thieves in a contract, anyone able to advise me on what actions I can take now would be great.

Hi guys just an update to my last, I know a lot of people have had issues with BT, I have managed to get mine resolved. There’s a free platform called resolver which you can use to raise any issue you have with BT. For some reason they seem to respond a lot quicker when you got through this platform. After a long winded battle with BT they have finally admitted their error and have changed my contract down to £30 a month."
128392,"Cowboys of the mobile phone realm.

Do not trust these guys. They will scam you.
I have paid off my 2 year contract through them which involved paying off a Huawei P10 and an O2 bill. An ok price for a phone this caliber and usage.

However when they called me to make a new contract, things started to get messy. They didn't give me the time they said they would allow me to decide whether I wanted a new contract that was MORE expensive than my previous one... Even though I had already paid for my phone and wasn't getting a new one.... Hmm.

Ok, I thought... I'll call them and we can sort this out. They said they could (great!) and we'll open you a new contract with the same usage for a quarter of the price with ID mobile and cancel the O2. Cool, finally getting somewhere.

This never happened. I am now paying for two contracts and can't get rid of them. I've called carphone and they said they would call me back as they don't know what has happened.

They never did.

Seriously do not go with these guys."
167268,"UTTERLY APPALLING

TV was okay, internet was alright, but I need to cancel it, the website literally has no links, I had to go through resolver just to get an email address to contact them, they said the account is fully closed down, and then billed me again 2 months after they've agreed to close the account.

I would never sign up with them again. The bother of cancelling is not worth it."

And I can’t contact customer service because the awful app logged me out and won’t sign me back in. Never again will I order from optimal print, my advice is find another option.

I WONT RECOMMEND them to anyone. Here is the email which i have sent them after called them for 10-15 times..



I applied for a mobile phone contract on 17th December 2019. First it got accepted and i paid £70 upfront deposit from my credit card. My order no was 422274730. But then order got declined. You guys should have refunded my £70 but you didnt bother to. Then i called you many times for refund but NOONE helped me in refund. Every customer rep told me that refund will be there in your account in 3-5 working days. Then a direct debit of £91 was deducted from my bank account on 02 Jan 2020 for this same order which you already declined. Its simple robbery which you did. After that i called again and again and again for my REFUND. But your customer service guys are highly incompetent, unprofessional and mannerless. They are just doing delaying tactics and wasted my time. They again told me that within 3-5 working days, you will get your refund. Its 22nd of Jan now. Its been more than a month now and i dont know WHEN I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK? WHEN THESE 3-5 WORKING DAYS WILL FINISH? 
If you have any iota of shame and if you are not robbers then please REFUND my money (£70+£91) ASAP...
Thats my Refund Ref no 22795561
Complaint ref no 0000640042
I dont want your cliche formal stupid replies of apologies and sorrys. Just REFUND my money ASAP or i will NAME & SHAME you on social media.."

138057,"If I could give them no stars I would. Despite cancelling my Nowtv pass, they have continued to take money for months after. I should have been more on the ball, but that doesn’t make it right! I’ve tried the live chat, that isn’t the live chat. It’s a shocking robot that doesn’t give options that are useful for my issue. I’ve tried calling the broadband side (the worst customer service agent I’ve ever spoken too, who spoke over me, didn’t listen, didn’t help and hung up) I’ve tried twitter. I’ve send a complaint. No reply. They now owe me a load of money, money i suspect I’m never getting back. What ever you do, stick with amazon or Netflix. Least then you’ll get decent things to watch, good customer service and when you cancel, it’ll actually mean cancelled.


Update!!!!

After ringing my bank Nowtv can only be stopped, regardless of cancelling your pass, by calling your bank and have a cancellation of recurring payment done. The bank can also raise a merchant dispute with Nowtv. So if you’re having the same issue as me, please call your bank. It’s actually really scary how little control you have over this. So I would advise anyone never to use Nowtv for this purpose"

Top it off the driver didnt even leave the drinks/food with secruity!!! Honestly deliveroo have fully lost control!
168264,"Ghd attitude towards customer service is apalling. They claim next day delivery, but I had to wait almost 1 month and the item never arrived. They blamed the delivery courier, but it is clear from the parcel tracking that the courier never received it either. If you telephone their customer service team they put you on hold for up to 1/2 hour listening to really bad music. However if you phone their place an order line they manage to answer the phone straight away. How can this be? They either don’t care about their customers or are receiving so many complaints they cannot cope with them. After waiting an extortionate amount of time for the product to arrive before finding out they had not sent it I had no option but to ask for a refund, and had to ask them again and again. They take your money really quickly and then hold onto it for as long as they possibly can. A disgusting company to deal with. I will never buy anything from them again."

I brought a Tv from Currys and took out their care plan from KnowHow, the care plan was the worst mistake ever. I have now been with out a TV for 8 weeks and still no TV. I have been paying the care plan for over 2 years now , my tv stoped working so I called KnowHow , they came picked up my tv and replaced it as my tv was unfixable , when It arrived it had no box, no remote or stand so I was unable to use it. I then called and asked for a stand , I have received 6 stands at different times but none that fit the tv. I returned the tv to Currys after 7 weeks as I was fed up with the broken promises from KnowHow, I have been promised a voucher so I can collect a tv myself but still no voucher , it’s been 8 weeks now and they don’t seem to be bothered. In my contract it say I will receive a working tv within 7 days so KnowHow have broken the terms of the contract. I have made complaint after complaint but nothing.

I don’t understand how Currys can recommend KnowHow when they are so bad, they have 87% bad reviews, and they are giving Currys a really bad name. If I had know this before hand I would never have used them.

We got a message to say the delivery would arrive 7.45-9.45 so went to the delivery location to get the space ready before that point. We then got a message to say it would arrive at 8.43. After 30 mins I called the helpline and after some investigation was told they were running 3 hrs late. An issue had occurred but there was no attempt to make us aware that the communication we’d been sent was inaccurate. Given they had all of our contact details, this would not have been hard. I got an explanation of the situation at this point but no apology. I explained that the delivery address wasn’t our house so I would need to return (50 min round trip) and was assured I would get a phone call from the driver 30 mins out. I told them I wouldn’t leave until I get the call and they said no problem! I checked the tracker link from the morning 2 hrs after we spoke and an updated time was there 45 mins out. I waited 20 mins, and no call was received so I called again to be first told they were already there, then after a confirmation call, that they were 15 mins away. No call received as promised. When they arrived, they realised they had delivered 1 of our items to the previous address, meaning an hour and a half’s round trip to correct the mis-delivery. When our product was re-delivered, the other address had opened the box and we were just told they hadn’t taken anything out.

Overall, prices great…items good but the delivery service and communication was awful and incredibly frustrating. Things don’t always go to plan, but the lacklustre response from customer services and the incompetence of the delivery team would lead me to not use this company again."

One employee even just left the chat because she didn't feel it was her job to find out why. Then someone called Luke promised me he would talk to whoever and they would write to me via email to explain why I was having difficulty. Nothing. That was 3 days ago. You people just don't seem to understand we are tired of giving you our money ( or trying to buy ) your products. Not being able to. Then receiving no answers to why ?

Finally rang them (a lovely waste of an hour), whereby I explained the situation. The customer service guy said he would send out packaging (again) and would detail this on my account, to ensure I’m not charged. Nice hey? HE DID NO SUCH THING. I’ve just received a bill which includes the £40 charge. Had to ring them again for them to not be able to help. I’m just glad I cancelled the direct debit, which I’m hoping means they can’t just take my money (like they have in the past).
Honestly the absolute incompetence of VM is outstanding and I tell EVERYONE to avoid them. Even if they are fast, it’s not worth the stress of being over charged!"
159524,I was able to order a fridge that said they had multiple in stock. Got a confirmation email and waited for delivery date. On the delivery date I hadn’t had any messages to say when they’d deliver so contacted them on live chat to be told item was out of stock and would be for 2 months. Was never contacted via email or phone regarding this so if I hadn’t reached out I don’t know when I would have found out.

145280,"I was offered £125 for my iPhone XS and £36 for my Apple Watch series 3. I had to pay postage myself as the pre paid envelopes insurance they sent didn’t cover the value they had offered for the devices. Once it arrived the phone offer was reduced to £60. The Apple Watch series 3 offer didn’t change.

Apparently the phone had a damaged microphone (I never had any issues on calls or listening to music), more than 3 scratches (I had already chosen the option that allows more than 3) and finally, spots on the camera (All my pictures are fine and I cannot see any spots on the camera).

I refused the offer and the next day they upped it to £85. I again refused. I asked for both items back and they tried to charge me £5.50 postage for the watch! I refused and asked them to put it in with my phone, which they did.

Dodgy company who consistently reduce the price they initially offer by quite some margin. AVOID."
179588,It's been 3 weeks and still haven't heard anything. I emailed them and they said they would dispatch ASAP. 10 days later and still haven't heard anything. I'm seeing reviews saying that delivery times were excellent from 1 day ago and less. Why is this not the same for me? Do not buy from these guys!

app's useless and restes after payment resulting in it being sent back to the bank 20mins later. Even sitting at the bank with the bank on the phone to them they still say its the banks fault...

then after dirty tricks they try to use to disconnect the chat telling you to close the app reset the cache log out and we will call you back then dont etc... ***

198712,"I recently tried to sell a Galaxy tablet to CeX, posted to them in very decent condition, well packaged on top of the original packaging. The device wasn’t quite grade A and had some minor wear and tear.

They informed me they couldn’t sell the device due to a bend in the trim on one side. This specific policy (typically they regrade the items) isn’t visible anywhere on their site. It didn’t help the site had quite a few issues over the last couple of days. When the device was retuned I was shocked to see that between me posting the tablet and having it returned by CeX, it’s been bent. To be clear it weas posted with the tablet in its original box, the box was wrapped in bubble wrap and that itself was placed in heavy duty bubble wrapped envelope. SO how the tablet managed to be bent is beyond me. Annoyingly they only returned the charge cable with it and not the plug as well. Of course, nothing can be done about this.

Given the lack of transparency on policy, and the abysmal care taken by their testers I would avoid selling to CeX. I’ve used them for 25 years, the brand used to be great. But, judging by the sudden surge in poor reviews I’m clearly not alone in thinking their brand is now very tarnished, and seemingly not trustworthy ."

169971,"If i could give a minus score i would. Worst service i could of imagined, in a time of great bereavement and loss for my family.

I am emailing about a few problems I’ve had with purchasing a washer dryer from Currys. My father originally purchased a Hoover washer dryer back in December 2018, he then unfortunately committed suicide in June, when we were clearing out his house I found a letter from the hoover candy group saying the washer dryer needed a part as was malfunctioning and he needed to book an engineer. I actually ended up inheriting the washing machine and so booked an appointment for an engineer to come out.

I ended up booking a day off work, the engineer came out and told me I needed a part. I then booked another day off work, the engineer came out fitted the part. Made me wait by his van for a parking attendant even though I gave him a parking permit, and “fixed” the machine. I used it once and it blew all the fuses in my house and left the smell of burnin plastic. I then called hoover candy again, booked the engineer to return, took another day off work, he came out ordered the part, told me to call up the call centre to book his return visit to fit the part, so booked a fourth day off in a month at work, he fitted the part, turned on the machine and it blew up my fuse box again. He then did a further investigation in the machine found the actual issue with it and told me I would have to wait for another part to be ordered.

He then told me he was retiring that week so I would have to book another engineer to come out, determine the problem and order the part again! So I called up hoover candy, booked another day for another engineer. Booked a 5th day off. I complained about the service of the engineer, his attitude and performance, the fact my machine was still broken and had literally blown up 4 times and they eventually gave me an uplift code for my machine. I then went to Currys ordered my machine (which took over an hour standing at the till because your system wasn’t working) and booked the machine to be delivered. Booked another day off work to wait for the washing machine to arrive. I stayed in all day and called the call centre to check the delivery time and it was definitely coming in the morning before I confirmed my leave with work, they told me it would be arriving. The drivers never showed, when I called the call centre the next day they told me that no-one was in. I didn’t leave my front room that entire day, which is next to my front door. The machine was finally delivered and installed and is working, which is 2 months down the line at least.

I have lost out on 6 days work, and my employer does not believe the convoluted story, as it is ridiculous as it sounds. Ive lost that money for those days taken off, as well as the grief tied in with losing my father this really has been very depressing for me. I have had to use the laundrette which was very expensive, and don’t drive so had to use public transport to carry my clothes. When you are dealing with grief a fresh set of clothes can change your day and I feel like this situation has made me feel horrible about myself. I really hope your willing to assist in changing the outcome of this experience because I am extremely upset. The service has been shocking.

They have now offered me a mere £30 compensation, and when i complained and told them how offended i would be if that's what they thought my time wasted was worth, they offered me an additional £50 but this does not touch the black hole of money spent on this situation, from launderettes to bus passes i'm out of pocket around £300 over 6 months! Not to mention the amount of time wasted! Apparently because i cant provide proof of my launderette use, as they take coins in a self service machine and team know how told me every week i would have a machine in a few days so thought was a short term thing, if i had an inkling of the scale that the problem would of manifested into i may of been more diligent, but i was lead down a trail of deceit and lies for corporate gain!"

117265,This app is awesome! Tons of great stuff to check out and sample! I would recommend this app to everyone!
158229,"I wish you could rate them lower than 1 star.

Poor internet quality for months, then when they finally listened to me and said they would upgrade me router, t never arrived. Then when i cancelled the service, they sent the new router and didn't actually cancel my service. They sent me an email saying that they had cancelled the service and then a month later sent me a bill. I've been on chats and on hold for hours, being passed around from person to person. Atleast if the internet had been half decent it may have felt it was for something.

I would recommend if you enjoy watching videos load, being cut off of work calls and spending hours on hold then these are the people for you."
185684,"Please take note to all the bad reviews from customers with BT contracts. BT is the biggest CON artist on this planet. They get you sign a 2 years contract with a promise so much a month. After 5 months they put your monthly amount up . You ring up and complain about this , all they can say is that they put it up because of inflation. This is where they conned the customers on the contract because customers can’t cancel. PLEASE think twice before going with BT. I definitely will not recommend this to anyone. The OFT should be notified about this , BT misleading customers on the contract.
I am going to make official complaint to OFcom. I going to bring it to their attention.BT already been fined hundreds and hundreds of thousands pounds by OFcom. Don’t bother with ombudsman , you get nowhere with them. If you have time check out Ofcom complaint on BT and how much they are fined."

138355,"The whole process from ordering the bespoke PC on the website to receiving and using it when it arrived was super exciting and painless. I was impressed that the website would tell you what was compatible with what so you never had to worry about building a PC with components that just wouldn't match. You could view your order status online and stay up to date with exactly which stage it was at.

Opening the PC for the first time, setting it up and seeing it on and in action was amazing. Absolute powerhouse and a thing of beauty, so happy with it and the quality of the build is very much evident. I look forward to using PC Specialist again, cannot recommend them enough!"
106944,My wife is not at all keen on a smart meter so i've been submitting my readings every week or so which is a good job really as last night when i was submitting our latest gas and electric readings i discovered that just over a week ago i'd erred quite badly with my gas reading and it was over 40 thousand kwh over the actual read as i'd mistakenly confused the first 2 numbers with my electric reading. Anyhow i've sent photos of my meter this morning along with a contact email informing shell of my mistake and i've received an email this afternoon stating my humdinger of a mistake has now been addressed. So it is a big relief. Thanks shell.

137034,"I am sharing this to help other people, please do not trade in your phone to Carphone Warehouse!!
I traded in my Google Pixel 2 for a new phone and I was quoted £130 on their website.
I sent it on 19/11 with proof of posting and I was expecting payment within 3-5 working days as it clearly states on their website.
I heard nothing, no payment. Tried to phone on 28/11 and I could not get through so I did the online chat. Very time consuming but the advisor was helpful. She said she would email the trade team and I would be receiving a payment shortly. No payment. I decided to phone again, I got cut off twice and finally spoke to a advisor he gave me a email address( apparently that is the only way you can communicate with them!). I emailed explaining everything to them, 22 days later and they email back today. No apology for the delay, and they say they will pay £25 in 3-5 working days. This is a absolute joke as this is a fraction of the fiqure that was quoted and it doesn't say the reason why!
I have read many reviews on here saying the same thing about people being scammed when they trade in their phones. I have told them I will not be using them again and I have been a loyal customer for many years. It is disgusting to treat loyal customers in this way! 1 star is way too much for this company!! 😠"

171471,"Used Deliveroo for the first time to order Wagamama and to say I am disappointed is an understatement! The wrong order arrived so I went on live chat and was told by Cyrus it would be redelivered. I said I didn't think I should pay for delivery so he said a refund was requested and I could track the order on the App before ending the chat. Nothing was showing so I went back on the App and asked again. Judith said they can't offer redelivery as it was my first order but a refund had been requested for the missing items. I asked to escalate the complaint and Juvilyn came on board to tell me I have a request in place for a refund for the missing items and that's all they would do. He even rudely said that's final. I said it's my birthday weekend and I had no food but they didn't care at all. Disgusting service and I will be deleting my account the second I receive my refund.

EDIT: Deliveroo confirmed via email that they had refunded me £19.30 but I only received £14.92 from PayPal who confirmed that that is what Deliveroo requested. I contacted Deliveroo and told them this wasn't the correct amount and I want the full payment. They promised to also refund the £5 service fees but again, only requested a refund of £3.87 from PayPal. PayPal kindly credited me for the difference and I am now deleting my account!"

187517,Tommy & Lee delivered our item & we’re very polite & friendly
125685,"I have been with three for many, many REGRETFUL years now and I have to say that they are absolutely the worst company! Throughout the years I've been with them, I have never complained so much, at least once every year there has been an issue and it has always been down to either them miscommunication or them lying/not coming through with what they said they would. This time they have really outdone themselves - I lose my phone and I tell them to cancel everything. I get a new contract, 2 months later I get a notice saying I'm being charged £50 for not cancelling the sim card (apparently you have to cancel the phone and the sim card separately) despite me telling them cancel everything. However because it was over the phone, there was no evidence.

Message them for 2 hours and in the end come to an agreement to cancel the bill as debt collectors are now involved - as 'promised' they said they would let know to stop it and will waive the bill.

Then 2 weeks later I message again as the debt collectors says it still needs to be paid. Then a lady called aniket says that I still need to pay the £50 despite her colleague saying I don't. Thankfully I had screenshots to prove this. She then tried to use an earlier message he wrote to say I needed to pay the £50. Whereas at the end of our conversation we decided I didn't need to pay it as I had already paid for what I used in first bill of my new contract

These people are CONNIVING, LIARS and will do WHATEVER they can to take your money. One tip - screenshots the conversations, email the transcript and record the phone conversations as evidence or you will end up losing a lot of money. These people will say one thing and do another! Once my contract is over, I will be over and done with this company, I honestly don't know how they're still in business, it's ridiculous"

193474,"I went to Morocco as a lone female traveller. Before I went I logged into my account to check roaming all ok to use. Their bot said all fine to use so off I went. Landed there and got Vodafone text telling me charges for Morocco, so still all fine. Tried to use phone but it didn’t work.
Used WiFi to log onto Vodafone chat and was told I couldn’t use roaming as part of my plan. Informed them the boy and text messages inferred otherwise and nowhere did it say I couldn’t. Said I’d happily pay daily charges and asked could they add it on? They said no I couldn’t get as part of my plan. Told them I needed to use my phone as was a lone woman traveller and was told that maybe I could upgrade my contract I.e. start a whole new more expensive contract. They said this was the only option but then changed their mind and said having double checked it wasn’t an option. Told them they were jeopardising my safety and I didn’t understand why they couldn’t just add it as a paid bolt on but they refused saying I wasn’t eligible and to go out and get a local sim. They then changed their mind re upgrade and told me they’d transfer me to explore new contracts. Got quoted significantly more to upgrade and begin a whole new contract. Was fairly shocked that they would use my clear distress as a way to get me to buy a new more expensive contract so instead hung up and a kind local helped me with a local sim. I will never use Vodafone again."

186666,Very pleased with delivery of chest freezer from Currys. the van they sent was quite big and a neighbour considered it too wide for our narrow road (probably it wasn't.....but....)-- so the driver elected to stop at a wider place and the two young men had to carry my freezer manually up hill around 100 m -- on top of that they carried it up steps into an outbuilding for me.

156246,"I would rate lower than 1 star if I could. I sent my phone in for trade in. Before sending I thoughly checked it over to make sure it had no screen burn. No scratches ect. After about 5 days of them having the phone I received an email saying they can't except the phone as fully working, due to screen burn (which wasn't there before), and rather than giving me £180 which was the initial offer, they could only offer me £30 something. I rejected the offer the same day. Over 14 days later I received an email saying they will send it back and will give me the tracking details once they had them. I never received the details. So how do I know they caused the screen burn not me?
1. I always had my phone in dark mode meaning the time, battery and icons, ect would always be white. The screen burn is black, as if the icons were black.

2. One of the icons burned in on the screen was Samsung's internet home button. I never used Samsung's internet, I've always used chrome.

3. I sent my phone off with 100% battery. Turned off. I received it back with 9% turned off. What have they done with it too use that much battery. When I turned it on the brightness was right up, past the safety warning, again something I would never do

Edit. After further inspection I have noticed they have tampered with my phone and now it will no longer have the IP rating it should."

103627,"The item was never delivered. I received an email from the delivery company that a card had been left at my address stating the location of the parcel. This wasn't the case. There was no card. This isn't Very's fault of course.

I had been trying for days to reach the Very customer service team through various methods. Their Facebook chat kept linking me to a login page which told me I had an incorrect case number - yet there was no option to insert such a thing.

After many attempts, and a 45 minute wait, I finally got in touch with a Very representative.

They told me the delivery team had updated the status to be delivered between a very broad set of numbers on my street - and to ""a blue door"". The funniest thing is, there is no blue door on my street.

I have not been offered any guidance on whether this will even be chased up with their chosen delivery company.

Despite never recieving my item, I am not being allowed a refund set up straight away, and am being told I have to wait for a message of theirs to come through over the next 2 days.

I asked if they could resent the item that never reached me, and they told me I would have to pay for this in full.

I tried to raise a formal complaint, which I have never done - despite actually working for a complaints team at an energy company. The only way they would close the ticket was if I accepted 10% off a next order.

Why on earth would I want to order from them again?"
164615,Terrific experience- really quick and I’m amazed they had the part in stock
139084,"I ordered an Elimina Series laptop for my business a couple of weeks before Christmas 2021 and was extremely happy with my purchase. The laptop was built and tested well, exactly to specification and despite the festive rush, was delivered on Christmas Eve.

The person who repaired my tumble dryer went above and beyond by advising me on how to maintain my tumble dryer, even going to demonstrating how to clean specific parts of the tumble dryer. Replaced the bearings and the tumble dryer worked as knew. He was knowledgeable and friendly. Would highly recommend."
162084,"I bought a google pixel 4A and wanted to return it. That should be fine within 14 days. I asked for the free DPD returns info and was told DPD website is down and i should send it by post(?!). Their website says free returns. I asked them why they were not keeping to the free returns info and they blamed DPD! I noted that my contract is with them, not DPD and they should pay for the postage and insurance. Twenty minutes of arguing and Bronwyn claiming there wasn't a manager later.... still nothing"

Honest & Trustworthy"

I have complained numerous times and been told there is no fault. But I cannot watch any internet tv without spinning wheels the same with my tablet and can’t use my Wi-Fi printer either. Today I have rung Talktalk twice and been put on hold then cut off.
Since this went public they have asked me to contact them, but why bother I’ve already been told 3 times there’s no problem."

I reported a fault with my bush american fridge freezer on 5th Dec 2022 was messaged to say I was getting a visit on 12th and I would be contacted the night before with ETA didn't receive message so was expecting one on the day received nothing but a sorry we missed you card apparently somehow they had the wrong contact details for me but argos pass the details on on purchase of insurance .D&G finally came out on the 19th saying it needed new part and wouldn't be fitted until after Christmas so we had to buy a second hand fridge to tide us over.engineer finally came out on Jan 3rd to fit new part we were told fridge freezer was not repairable .I received an email from argos with an e voucher attached for the purchase price of the faulty f freezer .new one to arrive on 12th of Jan,I asked for old appliance to be disposed of only to be told that they don't get rid of american fridge freezers so I now have to also pay to get rid of it. rang D&G customer service only to be told that they had fulfilled their obligations and nothing could be done about the money I'm out of pocket .So D&G do you normally take this amount of time to resolve things I think so judging by your bad reviews dating back at least a couple of years and well done argos for still using these people and how dare you ask me to take out this rubbish service on my replacement appliance. DO NOT USE THESE INCOMPETANTS"

My wife particlarly appreciates the light weight of the vacuum cleaner. The work light is so useful for working in dark corners. Even the vacuum cleaner covers our small home on one charge. We also appreciate the Black Friday sale prices."
182889,"Previous reviews talked about Mazuma finding issues with dust in camera and reducing price…seems to be a pattern…beware of the scam. Had phone checked before sending and everything was fine. Anyway, spent 7 pounds delivery and sent a 1 year old phone in perfect condition. Should have listened to the negative reviews. Asked for the phone to be sent back so will await with baited breath…should have gone to musicmagpie! Never again with Mazuma

Update: I have received my phone back today and taken again to the Apple store to run diagnostics on the camera and phone. Yet again…no issues were detected with the phone or camera…however this time I have asked for an official document stating this as well. If Mazuma would like to respond by stating anything about the reasons why the phone quote was reduced, I am happy to send them the document from the Apple store."

142975,Ordered three items although one item was awaiting stock ~ super fast delivery on the first two and a few days later received and e-mail that stated the third item was now in stock and had been dispatched which arrived next day ~ First time I'd ordered from Wex & was very impressed with the speed of delivery and kept up to date with my third item ~ has to be five stars

154806,"Great price for the Asus laptop- the model I wanted had sold out everywhere else. There was supposedly an issue re delivery, asking for more money via a scam email, which I didn’t realise, but customer support put my mind at rest and my laptop was delivered with no issues at all in the end."
171580,"My broadband isn't running at the promised minimum speed and it hasnt done for a long time. They've applied a 15% discount, fair enough, until I get my recent bill and realise thay they've only applied the discount for one month, not until the problem is fixed like they promised. For days I've tried to connect to the chat to talk to them about it and it won't connect, whether I try through the app or through the website. I could try and call them but past experience of trying to call them is lengthy and stressful because you get passed from person to person and no one really seems to know what they're doing. I'm a customer of almost 3 years but when my contract is up in August I'll be looking elsewhere unless they either fix my broadband speed or keep the discount on there as promised.

Edit: I managed to get through to webchat and 45 minutes later still have no resolution after being passed between 2 agents. The last agent said my speed is running at 47mbps but the Vodafone app says it's running at 52mbps. The minimum promised speed is 55mbps for the superfast 2 yet the agent is telling me the minimum promised speed is 40mbps!!! I had to end the chat due to not having the time to stay on it any longer but Vodafone can expect a huge complaint from me."

153270,"I have been a customer of Talktalk for a few years now. Initially I found the service very good but for the last year or so it has deteriorated. I had a fixed price contract with them and was told that there would be no price increase during that contract. Not true, my price went up and when I questioned this I was told that there is a clause in the small print that allows them to do this. I was told if I switched to my current contract however (no surprises it was more expensive) the price would be fixed with no increases during the contract term save for the now standard annual rate of inflation one in March/April. So I took that.
I received a letter not long after regards an increase in my fees...
I decided I would look into switching when my contract ends which is in April 2023. As my contract is coming to an end soon my broadband has started losing connection. 3 times so far this week, twice in one day. This is becoming a regular thing and I am sure if I complain I will be told if I switch too this other new (more expensive) contract it will solve the issue.
No thanks I am done with Talktalk.
Avoid at all costs."
183636,"Most fraudulent company I have ever used, and I once ordered from Pizza Hut so that's saying something!

If anything ever goes wrong with your order, then you are to blame, and god help you trying to get a refund! Chat is useless and are there to simply direct you to an email address. God knows when I will likely get a reply - if I do ill edit this."
154440,"Fantastic idea to connect customers to traders and services.
One problem:
When after some time you forgotten that you have their details already and contacted the previous customer again, you will be charged again for the details you already have paid for. Happened to me few times, as you can not remember hundreds of names."

196533,Been with them for a number of years for broadband. As long as you use your own router the service is great and the lowest priced provider by far in the UK. They really should improve their router though.
181519,"Really impressed with Optimalprint. I was looking for somewhere to get my child's artwork turned into birthday party invitations and this company came up in the search results of Google.
The ordering process was really simple and the price was the lowest I could find for my print job.
Not only was the delivery really quick, but the quality is great.
I will be a repeat customer when I next need something printed up."

Today I followed YouTube to change functions and I messed up the settings. I tried all day to put things right for hours but failed.
Then I rang the WEX product support line; it was answered within seconds by a human! That gentleman solved my problem.
I wouldn't buy from anyone else."
185802,"Moved home so placed a broadband transfer which it takes them around 4 weeks so waited 3.5 weeks and then rang up to get an update on the order only to find out they have cancelled the order...
So they would have to place a new order and told me to wait another 3 weeks before they could get an engineer to come out which is ridiculous as I work from home and have 0 signal at my property. Therefore I got offered £10 credit which I told him to stick it in his back pocket. Got a good deal with virgin media self install rooter which is being delivered in 3 days.Wouldn't recommend them at all they good at playing games. Keep away"

I tried to order an iPhone xs max over the phone, they said to me that my purchase have been declined as I have not passed their internal security checks, they wouldn't give me a reason why I didn't pass. I phoned my bank they said they the payment has been authorised and it will be in CPW in couple of days. I called CPW and told them that if that don't want to sell me an iPhone they shouldn't charge me, they said they didn't say that they don't to sell me a phone but my internal security checks with CPW has failed and that means i got declined. I wasn't taking a contract with them or anything, I was buying a sim free phone for 1249 pounds and I think thats why they refused as they prefer to tie people to contract. I asked them to cancel the payment if they didn't want to sell me the phone, they said they have done. called my bank again, they told me the payment wasn't cancelled, still pending and will be in their account in 2 days. called them back again to find out whats going on, they said they have cancelled it. I told the woman I spoke to that i will give them until the following day If that payment wasn't cancelled I will have to go to trading standards as this is theft...didnt want to sell me the phone but went ahead with the payment!! I went to a nearby CPW to be told im not the first person complaining about this issue and that I will have to call customer services to make sure my payment is cancelled. I will wait for tomorrow to see what happens!!! NEVER EVER AGAIN BUYING ANYTHING FROM CPW NOT EVEN A CHARGER OR PHONE COVER!!!"

The advisors are racist and sexist, I was accused of lying about my name and lying about being the account holder. I was called Mr when I’m a Miss . In my culture my name is unisex but the advisor said I was a liar, and that I had call back to pass security, even though I did pass it. I tried to educate him
On my culture but he laughed . He then hanged up the phone. Logged a complaint but no manager called me

My lawyer had advised on two illegal behaviours vodaphone have acted.. They are racist, sexist and abusive.

They are disgusting and the worst network provider out there!!!!"
108478,"I moved to BT fibre during lockdown at Virgin aren’t very good in my area. The connection is generally pretty good and with multiple devices it very rarely disconnects. Definitely better than Virgin. I did have a spell where it wasn’t very fast and when I called them they just told me that the speed they guarantee is just to the router and not to devices. So lesson learned and I am fairly sure this is what all the other providers do too
Am yet to have a real issue so can’t comment too much on their customer service side"

They do not abide by consumer rights nor are they at all helpful. I have lost more money than I have spent with these, but no more and I would advise customers to do the same. Account deactivated and have found better options with other sites."

184889,"I always thought 3 to be an ""OK"" company and have a number of contracts with them. However recently I have had issues with a 5g home broadband hub. 3 agreed with me that it hadn't performed well and agreed to end my contract early with no further fees or penalties subject to me returning the device to them. I promptly did this sending it return of post and registered. It was received and signed for 8th August, it is now 18th August and 3 won't acknowledge they have it despite me giving them the Royal mail tracking number and have taken another monthly payment from my account. 3 refuse to send anything in writing to confirm the contract is cancelled or do anything to help. Waste of time telephoning them as I just get fobbed off. Awful company that I won't be renewing my other contracts with when they expire.
In response to 3's reply, With respect I don't see what 3 is going to do that they have failed to do on the long and many telephone calls that have proved pointless to date

188215,"NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHATSOEVER!!
THEY HAVE NO COMMUNICTION SKILLS AND NEED BASIC TRAINING
I have had so many problems when calling this company, trying to get through to someone who is capable of dealing with a basic query, never mind a faulty box, has caused so much frustration that I cancelled this contract after 1 day. It actually took 3 long calls over 3 weeks but it was confirmed by the operator, the contract was cancelled within the time period with no payment needed. I asked for a confirmation email but was told this is not possible??Now after months of stressful calls to this company I am insulted that I am now getting texts from a debit agency for a disconnection fee!!! For weeks this company could not find my details but no problems contacting me when it comes to payments!!"
151913,"As a service provider, the leads are far too expensive. You are looking at 40 euros to be one of 5 people that can respond to a job and have no guarantee of getting the job. It's just not worth it. The Elite thing is even more of a scam. I like the idea, but the price to respond is crazy.

EDIT: Why not refund the credits if one does not get the job and only charge those who are awarded the job? That would make your model fairer. There are plenty of jobs that require 30 to 40 credits to respond to yet the information etc couldn't be blander. Perhaps, let the customers know that service providers need to spend their hard-earned money to respond to the ads. Then they might actually tell you what they need. It's unbelievable how an ad can cost 40 to respond to and you don't even know what the job is because the poster has provided no context.

Again, good idea, MASSIVELY flawed and greedy."

They renewed my contract by another 18 months offering me a very good deal on the broadband during Black Friday but it is not reflecting in my account and the contract says my bill is going to double after the current contract ends. I called called them 4 times and after keeping me on the call for an hour each time and promising that they will fix this, they have not. And in my final call they are saying they cannot honour that deal and asking me to pay a lot more to renew. Absolutely shocking! I wish I had fibre broadband from other providers in my area. I would have switched in an instance. My advise is if you have other providers in your area that offer the speed you need, please switch to them. DO NOT GO WITH VIRGIN MEDIA!!"

I had to ask online for someone to sort and email last time. This time I have only received one and spent a good half hour on the phone. I am praying that the future invoices will be emailed to me (she did say she has set up but I am starting to doubt considering I only got one invoice through the email and the other is not there, so going to have to call AGAIN.

171041,"Truly awful service which is getting worse by the minute. They removed the stream on two devices system and now charge an extra £5 a month for ‘boost’ if you want to continue with a benefit you were already paying for. To cover up this blatant money grabbing from their loyal customers, they glossed it over with ‘you can now stream on 3 devices and have ad free viewing’. Well ad free viewing was never an issue before and I only want to stream on two devices so they are essentially ripping their customers off and trying to pass it off as giving us a better service. Forcing them to pay an extra £5 a month when they did not even ask for these extra benefits. I followed through a complaints process with this horrible provider and had a manager named Hozefa managing my case, well, they closed my complaint without even answering my questions and we’re not even bothered by the fact I was clearly upset and wanted to leave. Their first response to my initial complaint was that ‘they haven’t increased the cost to my current package, we have only added benefits’ well, as you can see, this was a blatant lie as I could stream on two devices before but I now have to pay an extra £5 a month for boost to keep that same service? As I mentioned above, they are charging you extra and trying to hide it at the same time with blatant lies. Clearly they have no regard for their clientele and they are more concerned with taking peoples hard earned money than providing them with a decent service. Bear in mind, all of these increases came on the back of a worldwide pandemic, where countless people are earning less or have lost jobs completely. No customer care at all, I have cancelled my subscription and will not be returning, absolutely vile company."

122619,keeping me updated on how the repairs on my daughters computer are going
113066,The experience was good but took 14 days to receive money. Probably down to Royal male strikes but I was a little disappointed with how long it took to receive payment when it said 5 working days.
100495,"Worst company I have ever dealt with. You get £50 if you refer a friend but they DO NOT give you it. The call centres are abroad and every single time I call they hang up on me. The service is diabolical. I raised a complaint and it has never been resolved. They just tell me to ring, but when I raised the complaint I specifically mentioned that it is very stressful to call as the advisors hang up on me or put me on hold for 15-30 mins at at time. I have screen shots of them keeping me on hold for so long, which I sent through but they still ask me to call. It's like talking to a brick wall. Can't wait to get out of the contract. The internet is rubbish, I live in a bungalow and need boosters all over and it's still doesn't work properly. I have tried and tried to resolve this issue but the company just does not want to help the customers. I had no other option but to leave this comment,"
110878,Next day delivery and price of battery extremely competitive and value for money. Have purchased from them before and always very efficient.
131320,"The book arrived before the delivery date, packaged well and the finished product was great! Happy with my experience using snapfish. Thank you. Karen"
150885,This company is a way to improve your online experience! I like it a lot!
144977,"Cancelled sky services and transferred to BT. Engineer arrived on 6th Sept to install broadband and landline. Was told the landline number we’ve had for over 40yrs would stay the same. But no! was given new number, so after lots of phone call, emails, chats and promises as of todays date, 5 weeks later, we still do not have our number back, am so angry! Everytime we try to contact customer services it’s at least a 45 minute wait, this service is just not good enough, each time are told that they understand,not to worry the number will be changed back, it takes a week to do, and that’s a fast track! Not impressed! Have now logged 2 official complaints, which also appears to have got us nowhere!
WELL ITS 6 DAYS ON AND STILL DO NOT HAVE OUR OLD NUMBER BACK, having had numerous emails tx and promises, this really is very poor service!!"
179633,"Ordered 2 items from Ebuyer some cable extensions and an AIO cooler, paid for delivery on a Saturday as I work full time.

Saturday rolls around and the cable extensions are delivered, driver goes back to their van to grab the cooler for me and instead drives off even with me chasing him up the road stating later that the delivery was refused.

After complaining to Yodel direct they agreed to try and deliver later that day which they then didn't and re-delivery was set for Monday.

After taking a day off work to receive this delivery as the build was already now several days behind schedule they stated that they could not find the address.

Order cancelled, I could not recommend anyone use Ebuyer until they change their choice of courier to someone reliable like DPD as Yodel are well known for being the least reliable courier in the UK."

176497,Just tried price matching with this company on 2 items. Nightmare! Held for nearly 30mins then had a difficult lady who tried to say AO are biggest company in their game and worth paying more as they rate so highly. Couldn’t be bothered in end so went with Tekzone who saved me £300 quid and offered me a free 5 year warranty (parts & labour) on Sony TV!
139052,"Easy to order correct battery, great price and delivered promptly"
163746,Delivery team were very friendly and super service on getting our rather tall freezer in though our doors excellent
149093,Quick communication and always keep you up to date on when things will be delivered or repair team coming
164396,Shocking service. Can not stand Vodafone. Promise you a service then don't provide it. Don't waste your time.
104795,Never heard of this firm and was somewhat skeptical. However was pleasantly surprised! Unique products and fantastic delivery! Highly recommended
106849,Absolutely terrible service. I have phoned on numerous occasions as they are charging me for a phone I cancelled years ago and every time I call them they leave me on hold for around 40 minutes and then cut me off!!!!
185886,I realised I had made a wrong purchase and Hughes’s stopped delivery and organised a refund.
100854,"I have been with talktalk for over ten years , I Have NEVER NEVER HAD a problem with them.
I cannot recommend them enough.
My husband who I married after , decided he wanted to change , I honestly consider changing the husband. For real , don't hesitate pick talk talk over any other providers that will make a huge difference for simple billing and if ever problem arise customer service will make a huge difference."
180351,"Feel I have been robbed. Rarely use computer (pensioner) but Currys/PC World signed me up to Team Knowhow at £40 per month
Be careful what you sign"
151927,"The Braun 600ml blending beaker which I purchased is excellent and was delivered within the time period, as promised, in very robust packaging. Could not be happier, and will certainly come back to order more items as needed."
136001,Reliable well made product. This is the best light weight vacuum cleaner
136931,"While I have had some positive experiences with Currys, the last purchase I made, where I paid for a delivery window, has been useless. I waited in an empty house for the four hour delivery slot, only to discover, after spending an hour on the phone to try and speak to a human, that they'd tried to deliver out of the arranged times, hadn't contacted me or left a card. In total I wasted 6 hours as I was told he would come back but didn't.
I managed to make a complaint through a call handler who spent about an hour on the phone with me writing down all the details, and told me someone would get back to me. They didn't.
Curry's have become impossible to contact unless you've got hours to waste hanging on the phone only to be put through to a chatbot which are useless. There is no option to email customer services, I did write to one but was told by return they didn't respond to those any more.
It's shocking that they care so little about their customers, their time and what they pay for. I won't be using them again. I should at least be getting my delivery charge back but they can't even do that.

Isn't it interesting that the response from Currys says exactly the same thing as it does to all the other reviews? I did in fact contact them at the specified email after reading those, with all the details and the complaint number. Nothing. It's not good enough. We're not as gullible as you seem to think."
119622,Good service. quick response.friendly customer service
112445,HMV is one of the best. On time again. Thanks 🙂
188461,"I ordered a christmas bauble with a photo and it is really cute and delivery was fast, but the qulity is not ideal, it looks a little bit cheap, but for this price I stil enjoy it."
175552,"The most appalling cutomer service system I have ever come across. Over 3 days I spent 5 hrs trying to get a PAK code. They couldn't find the account, then it was on an old system, then it was a business account, then a consumer account. Passed from pillar to post and still trying to sort it. They're appalling and should be avoided at all costs.Now sorted afte 7hrs 10 mins on telephone!!"
120244,"Great product, quick delivery, great customer service"
187617,Good pictures of products and great information of types of equipment they could be used in.good prices and speedy delivery.
198157,"One of the great joys of PAID FOR streaming is that you don't have to sit through tedious adverts. Welcome to the future. A future where there will be no hiding from adverts anywhere, unless you always pay that bit more. Not surprised that NOW TV have done this, they've always been by far, the worst streaming platform, and worst, mostly non-existent customer service. They haven't even bothered replying to negative comments on this site. On a special offer. No way will be going any further after it ends."
159506,"There were delays due to parts not being available, and even when we agreed to swap to an alternative part, this too was unavailable.
We had problems finding the Windows activation key, and rang for help. The call handler tried his best to assist, however, despite us sending photos of the scratch off panel, and even of the panel peeled off from the envelope, we could not find the code. After consulting a colleague, the call handler advised the code may have been applied to the back of the case. It transpired the code was there, however it had been poorly attached. The call handler tried his best to help, including ringing me back at 8.30pm, however, the code was unreadable.
It took several hours and many failed attempts to guess the correct characters of the activation code.
To his credit, the call handler email me the following morning to ask if the problem had been resolved.
Overall, our recent experiences with PC Specialist have not been as favourable as our previous dealing with the company when we bought our former PC around 7 years ago."
151984,"The pro broadband is shocking.
The customer services team are worse.
""wifi xperts"" LOL, great script reading.
3 days solid on chat with them and got nowhere.
AVOID AT ALL COSTS if you value your mental health."

111268,"Excellent service
Great advice
CUSTOMER SERVICE always good"
158930,Easy to use no faffing about contacted them the following day got a postage bag from them. Email to say they had received it and paid into bank account the same day.
126509,Very poor speeds both tv and laptop runs very slow. I’m paying more for less and I’m not a happy customer. It’s really difficult to get through to any one and very frustrating. I’m starting to look for another provider 😡

121336,Ordererd a hair dryer 10 days ago .still with hermes .emailed your customer service team no reply im wondering if im ever going to recieve it .going by hermes track record probably not .
179811,STILL AWAITING REFUND MONTH 3 waiting for refund. Don’t bother replying to this Currys saying ‘to call or email for help.’ We have done that and spent more than 15 hours on the phone I’ve actually now been into store also and been promised a call back that never came. NOBODY IS HELPING. Only excuses have been made. So if all I can do is leave a review to stop someone else making the same mistake and losing their hard earned money I will. And as for these 5* reviews that are clearly being posted by the company it’s just getting embarrassing now. Currys won’t make it past 2021
125819,Good service. Cost of delivery too high (£4) compared with the item cost (£7).
145614,"My remote for the talktalk.box. stopped working. I contacted taljtalk via chat.

135922,"Took a long time to resolve a small matter. Shell installed a smart meter that could not get a signal for communication. They were unable to accept my readings and so left me without a bill / invoice for months despite my efforts. I would give Shell 2* rating but Megan from customer services resolved within a day. She proved highly efficient, effective and patient as well as good to her word in follow up communications. She saved the company. Thanks Megan!"
174647,"Cancelled in May due to zero connectivity - took me and my other half 6 hours online to break free as kept being stalled with a load of old waffle and just under £400 between us even though we had no service. Now, in September, they still owe me money, as they've charged me the monthly bill, yet they set their debt collection service on me for cancelling the direct debit. Spent over 7 hours in online chat since cancelling to find my account is still active on 3 occasions. When I mentioned the amount of time is problematic due to a medical condition, they demanded to know the nature of it so they could put me on a register for special needs. None of their business! My only special needs as far as they're concerned is clarity, transparency and fair treatment.
Cheeky beggars. Still not resolved, and if a Three rep comments on this review, don't offer me a chat link, we're done - next stop is the Ombudsman. Avoid like the plague."
144048,Highly recommended. Great communication. Item arrived well packaged and on time. Good competitive price. Will definitely order other products from this company and refreshing to have a business that has fantastic customer service. Well done!

179805,"Optimal print deliver consistently, on time and to a good standard. I use them for my Christmas cards every year. The only thing I could complain about is that the user interface to design cards is a bit clunky and temperamental.

116924,"Choose to go with BT for my business back in November 22 they kept saying my Internet was live. There is no bt box in the shop and have spoken dozens of time to them. Open reach still hasn't been sent out to the shop. But they are now chasing me for £258 and have sent a debt collecter to collect the funds. Worst experience I have ever had with a company.

They even left a note on their system. 2 weeks later they demand £50 in cancellation fees. Will now take legal action. Avoid they only try to scam people.
Also lied to my wife that there is no note on the system,spoke again today and Yusef found the note,connect me at 19:15 with the cancellation team only to leave me on hold for 50 minutes before they drop the lines!"

189548,"Phone and internet has failed 5 times in 2 months and it's gone down again. That's a real problem as we have no mobile phone signal where we live and my mother has just been taken to hospital 100 miles away. NowTV requires me to be at home to log a fault..... how, when the line is down? I've gone to my daughter's house. There are no options on the website to register a line fault, they are all broadband faults. The chat function is to a computer only. There is no phone number to call (I had to contact someone in Sky - Sky owns NowTV). Hasn't anyone in NowTV ever thought what the reasons are a customer might call and tried out the service from a customer's perspective? Obviously not! No fault has been logged until today despite the line being down for 3 days. Openreach is about to go on strike for two days and the lead time for an engineer is 4 days. So yet again we won't have any service for two weeks."

From first contact (as it was a large 5-appliance order) through scheduling delivery and the actual delivery itself, this couldn't have been any more ""that's how you do it"".

193604,"Dodged a bullet?
Decided to take on their offer of 5G for a 24 month contract.
I have had no outstanding debts for at least 9 years, used two other networks for even longer, yet when I tried to purchase my order with them them it failed because I did not pass their credit check. I've tried to contact them by chat and email because I want my answers in writing but these options are not available for some reason.
Maybe this is a good thing that I have to take my money elsewhere, it doesn't bode well that they can't even get the first move right.
Well I took the advice as seen below, 6 months later, and I still can't complete the order because there is an ""issue with the network"" in my area, after being told there was coverage.

I sent off my iPhone 13 Pro Max, original offer was £560 I believe the revised offer from Mazuma was £190 claiming there was an issue with the camera. My phone was only one year old and in excellent condition so I knew this could not be true. I rejected the offer and traded in directly to Apple for £550! Mazuma’s behaviour feels very dishonest and deceitful and I could not recommend less. Please review your deceptive pricing model Mazuma Mobile."

I applied via the internet for my contract, unfortunately didn’t receive the email to say it was accepted I knew I was accepted when the phone come to my house the next day. Pleasantly surprised.

I love my new phone. So thank you.

The only down side I couldn’t keep my old phone number as easy as the staff make out it is. It’s really a big faff about. I had no option but to open an extra contact to O2 for 3 days then transfer back to Vodafone but it was too much I would rather just change the number in the end."

103713,"I called up for an engineer to look at our boiler. Was greeted by an overseas call center. No manners. Didn't listen to what I said. Heavy breathing while he was trying to figure out what to do. Which was give me a number to call the engineer myself. They didn't have anyone in my area? They seen to not have many engineers in my town. We live in a big town in Richmond upon thames. And in the background you could hear laughing and chat. Like it was a house party.

Update.
After the engineer visit. He said he needs to order some parts and left.

The next day, I recieve an email stating that we need a new boiler and Domestic and General will pay out £750 towards a new one. This isn't bad but the company they directed us to does not deal with our brand or type of boiler and said it could cost up to £5k (ballpark number as they have not assessed. The gas company people were lovely but they could not help.)

So that leaves it up to me, again, to find the boiler and installer. It makes me angry. We still have no hot water or heating and In winter.

For this boiler (platinum) policy. I pay over £400 a year. To only receive £750 towards a new boiler system. Not including installation and delivery.

I have had similar experience with other products I have with D&G with no engineers in my area! This example has been the worst."
112659,"Absolutely pitiful, I bought BT gaming broadband
hoping it would be a saviour from the HELL TALK TALK sent my way BUT NO it was an absolute load of crap for the first month it was just about bearable but now it has got to the point where after just 5 minutes of trying to play an online a game with my friends I WANT TO CRY!!! The latency goes from about 60ms to 1000ms and back to 60ms in about 5 seconds it does this every 10 seconds this makes it almost imposable to play any online combat games like call of duty or fortnite and then when I tried to get an engineer over to fix it he said there was no problem and threatened to make me PAY £90 JUST FOR THE CALLOUT TO FIX MY SODDING WI-FI then when I challenged him about my problem he magically found a problem and ""fixed"" it. My Internet is still absolutely terrible to this day! Just waiting for the day that I can finally switch to ZEN internet.

STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM BT AS YOU CAN!!!!!!
Edit: Now after trying to reach out to support (like Mandy said) they have just sent me back to there original support website from Facebook messages!! BT support is an absolute joke and I stand by my original comments STAY FAR AWAY."

185579,"Although Deliveroo have a great range of restaurants they are very poor. Everytime we order it's either missing an item or cold (as they aren't even using correct packaging to transport things to keep them warm). Tonight we were missing a meal, started were cold and tacos soggy meaning the dish was inedible. It took over an hour to get them to refund the missing item. They were offering a credit for the other items but my husband found a large chicken bone in his burrito whilst on the online chat at that point they then said there was nothing they could do and wouldn't even refund the missing item. There is no quality control and customer service is poor. Stick with Uber Eats and Just Eat."
181889,"Still waiting for an order placed 3 weeks ago. After 2 weeks I informed espares that it hadn’t arrived. I was told it had been lost in the post and that a replacement would be sent once I confirmed my address which I did straight away. A week later I have just been informed that it has not yet been dispatched and will not arrive for another week. It’s probably not their fault the first order got lost but I expected a speedier response to rectify the problem. Just hope it turns up next week - a month after the order was made.
I received an email from espares immediately after posting this to apologise and refund the cost of the order. Apparently, the item was returned undelivered to espare by Royal Mail with no explanation by Royal Mail as to why. I have been assured the item is on its way. As I have never had a problem with espares before I have changed the star rating from 1."

150237,"I ordered a PC from PC Specialist and it took a while to arrive due to pre-ordering a component. When it did eventually arrive it unfortunately did not immediately work, it's more than likely encountered a ""ding"" during transport. I spent some time on the phone with customer support who then asked me to RMA the machine.

I wrote an original negative trust pilot review and got a response from Rhys, who kept in contact with me throughout the <5 day RMA time. (A faulty component was replaced) and the machine was dispatched and is now with me working just fine.
So while it was unfortunate to have my original issue it was clearly a hiccup to an otherwise good experience, thanks to Rhys and the team."

Spoke with chat again, basically its just not been delivered and they don't know why. So that's 2 days off work, 2 days without pay, and now 2 cancelled deliveries with no notice at all from Argos.

I had a mistake with my initial order due to the stock writing being included rather than left blank and they dealt with it immediately and sent out a free reprint immediately.

193902,We had a very unusual situation with an incorrect meter serial number and Mpan in a flat that we manage which could have resulted in the tenant being without electricity for a night but Amar took control of the situation and managed to sort everything out - leaving a very happy tenant. Very pleased with the service from Shell Energy on this occasion!

I have bought several items from Argos in the past , but have cut my Argos Card up and will not buy anything in future."

122870,"I've been having awful problems with Virgin and was amazed to find so many FB groups devoted to its poor service! My contract was due for renewal on 13/11 and Virgin sent me an email saying the monthly charge would increase from £35 to £66 so I tried to call them in vain and ended up chatting with them on their WhatsApp group. To cut a long story short, we agreed on a new monthly figure of £21 with a reduced download speed of 50mb. The next day, I received a confirmation email informing me that there would be an initial charge of £92! Back on WhatsApp, they were unable to explain the amount and how it was calculated so I said forget it, just cancel the contract which they agreed to do with effect 3/11 and that I had to return their equipment, which was picked up by a Virgin employee on 11/11. Then, 3 days ago, I receive a reminder about an unpaid bill of £52! Back on FB, they said the new contract was still active and that I had to pay. I sent them evidence of the cancellation (their own WhatsApp message) which didn't move them. I had to pay. Then I reminded them that they had picked up their kit so how could the contract still be active. I had to pay. Phone call to their customer service and this time I got through! After explaining my issue in a very irate manner, I was transferred to a customer relations guy who agreed with me (hooray!) but had to ask his manager to intervene with supporting evidence which I supplied. That was two days ago, nothing heard since. Thank god I cancelled my direct debit! Virgin is an awful company with awful customer service. Stay well away!

Edit: I managed to speak to a certain Stephen, from Customer relations, who assured me that after settling an amount of £52.37, the contract would be cancelled and I would have nothing further to pay. In fact, I would be due a refund. This morning, the Virgin Media Complaints team has sent me an email saying I still owe £18.92! Woeful incompetence! Virgin, get your house in order and stop bothering me!"
125052,"Awful, just awful. I really can't be bothered to sit here and write my very bad experience with them and Currys but trust me when I say, look for an alternative company to deal with. Bad in every aspect"

194646,"One of the worst companies i have ever had the misfortune to deal with , once they take your money pre delivery they couldnt care less when how or if your goods are on their way. Staff are rude and instore have a couldnt care less attitude. They use DPD as a delivery service who are one of the worst delivery companies on the PLANET ! I wont be buying anything else from Carphone. Atrocious customer care !"

She signed up and it was installed 29th April firstly the engineer never had her up and running properly,her fone was working,they was telling lies as to when it was going live etc,then we managed to get her on the landline after a lot of fone calls and last friday20th may 2022,her fone went off,she could ring out but no1 could ring in,she's disabled and blind relies on a landline,she was told many many stories by different associates etc and rung again and was told don't know nothing about the problem,she has a constant error message going off and want to charge her £85 for an engineer to see to their own equipment,she was basically told to get on with it she's in tears and stressed out a new home should be full of happiness but BT have made this experience of a new home a nightmare.

I would like to also add that the money came out of my bank account for this phone within seconds and now they’re failing to refund me"
121321,Perfect app to help you to get started!
119904,Vodafone Penzance store between 2 and 3pmish yesterday june 27th 22! The guy who my friend asked for help was as useful as a chocolate tea pot! He had an issue where his phone screen stopped working. And the guy in store SHOULD OF KNOWN to hard reset etc all he did was put it on a brief charge and told the person to go to truro. He was as helpful as a chocolate tea bleddy pot. The phone is also on a contract and no help to get a replacement or it fixed was offered. I think you need to sort your customer service people out! Esp in Penzance store! They are there to do their jobs and if they don't why pay them! It puts people off going in store to ask for help cos of !d!ots like this. Sort it out
180959,"Excellent experience. Easy to naviagte through the system. It was very effecient, swift and fair."
131605,"I've been with BT for 21 months now (forced due to them owning the FTTP or something on this new property). For those 21 months, we've had terrible wifi connections and speeds even though it was the 150MB deal and the devices would keep disconnecting continuously. Today I spoke to Elle from customer service who has not able to offer anything remotely competitive to competitors including their own new customer offers. She also was not honest about prices when asked and gave old prices as supposed to current deals and was not honest about what day I could cancel my contract whilst providing 30 days notice and not incurring any fees.

Overall terrible experience and would not recommend to anyone.

Even 1 star is unfair to the star itself!"
195348,"This company calls you when you have specifically made sure that all boxes relating to consent have been unchecked or checked stating you do not wish to be contacted. 5 times during the day they rung my wifes mobile, and they have just rung while she was at home to me. All you can do to stop this is be extremely abusive as this is the only language the operators understand. DO NOT enter your current mobile number in any forms on their website. You have been warned people."
153505,"KnowHow, are you joking. I've rang twice, been on hold for an hour, got through to someone each time, who then transferred me to cancellations. Both times the call has just hung up on me after being on hold again for a while. What's the game here, I only got through to the cancellations ONCE and they asked for my ref number, they proceeded to have a chat with someone else while I was on the phone, and then they hung up on me.

Get your act together."
146437,"This was our first experience with Appliances Direct. We were a tad concerned about some of the negative reviews. However, our experience was excellent!! Easy to order and pay for. Regular contact to say when and by whom the delivery was going to be made by! Would definitely recommend!!"

169168,"Unable to deliver product by expected delivery date, tried online chat to find out what was happening, spent an hour and a half with an unhelpful Jahri, evenutually he said he cancel my order and issue a refund, this still hasnt happened. Shocking customer service"
186270,"Please avoid getting a phone from this company. Still awaiting refund 9 months later. My experience very similar to other comments made - no phone in the first instance - waited nearly a month being promised a phone, Then cancelled the order and subsequently fobbed off with the we are experiencing delays due to Covid you will be refunded within two months (not the 14days stated) the date always comes and goes no refund. They took my money in under 10seconds!!

You are unable to speak to anyone directly by phone or webchat. So email is the only option. Be very interested in anyone's experience with using the small claims procedure - so please post here!!"

This is not the worst, I've called on Friday and got no response. Today I called earlier and after 30 minutes I had an answer, but then was cut off. in the first they were going to book it but I got cut off. in the second call they asked me for reference number. I said I don't have it but I already had a repair so you should know. They kept asking me for it, I insisted they should have it. Then they say ""I'll give you benefit of doubt"". Oh my God. After finding my reference number they have now passed me on to someone else who I am supposed to give this reference number to. I'm taking names, but due to GDPR rules I might run into problems so won't mention names

time now 60 minutes....
Afetr 114 minutes they said they will call me back after 24 to 72 hours

bye"

199791,"Do not switch to BT
Customer service non existant. It has taken 5 weeks after signing a contract with BT to connect my phone. Spent hours talking to various departments. I had a call from Neil at customer services telling me eventually I was connected.
When i advised him I would shortly be receiving an invoice for the month passed, i was assured no problem it would be sorted.
Then received this bill from them. 2 days later received a formal letter from them "" If this bill is not paid, your service wouild be terminated.""
Spent more hours waiting in phone queues to talk to their accounts department. No reduction in bill for lack of service,spent again over an hour to talk to an operative, requested Twice for Neil to telephone me back. To date this call has not been received.
Customer service is appalling. No phone for over 5 weeks, 2 days after failing to pay bill warned my service will be suspended.
Be warned keep clear."

170894,Been a customer since 2010 all my electrical products are from Richer Sounds customer service is always outstanding. I always prefer to go in store for anything. The staff always looks after their customers. Delivery service is efficient and reliable. Communication is always 100%. Today my delivery came to which I was very happy to receive it earlier than expected.
101057,"I was a little confused setting up my fibre router today, switching from BT. Shatees offered patient and informed support to assist me via the internet link. I am very grateful for his support and guidance. Now all up and running with the broadband working well. Thank you"

128961,"Engineer came out on time, was very polite pin pointed problem and fixed it straight away while doing this had a great conversation with him!"
190934,I renewed my contract over six months ago and still can't see my usage or bills. Customer Service is a waste of time and get ghosted by their engineers email address. The app is not fit for purpose either!
116801,"Delivered right part, on time well packaged."
127415,"Our order (tumble dryer) arrived very promptly within the indicated delivery time slot - we had already been fully advised of all the procedures by email. The delivery crew were very efficient in carrying the dryer upstairs to our second floor flat, installing it and taking away our old dryer.To date, we have been pleased with the dryer."
129228,Excellent product and quality service at very reasonable prices
176921,"The actual service in my experience has not been bad. I very rarely have problems with anything or the passes. sometimes the Now TV broadband can be rubbish but it is mostly good.

As far as the customer service I don't think I've ever had to deal with them, apart from the internet going down for a week which turned out to not be their fault.

The two main issues I have with Now TV is the prices. It's the same old story I suppose, when I joined years ago it was a well price decent service. Sadly the prices crept up over time to the point where it was no longer worth it. Especially the cinema pass. I received an E-mail today informing me that the prices for all of the passes will be rising. Not only that they are now charging separately for all different passes including the entertainment pass which was free with my broadband deal. ""Don't think so Now TV!"". I immediately cancelled every pass I had and will not be buying them again. Bar maybe a rare day pass. They have now lost my business for three passes which amounted to about £50 a month. I invite them to take the mick with the broadband, I will not hesitate to cancel that too.

I literally have no clue how they are competing with the likes of Amazon Prime and Netflix. Both of them supply a better service and are better value for money.

The second issue is their main website is literally useless. It's buggy as hell which made canceling the passes ten times harder than it should have been.

I was going to give 3 stars but I've put it down to 2 because it's annoyed me that much."
153665,"Fantastic service.
Kept updated throughout. Great deals to be had"
130555,"The delivery guys were amazing with bringing the machine in for me, and taking away the old one. What I didn't realise was just how tight the transit bolts were to remove. Definitely not a job for a woman in her mid 50s with various disabilities. I finally had a male friend round to do it for me yesterday and even he had trouble getting the things off, then getting the new machine into the hole. I eventually discovered how to work it by pressing some buttons. I've since been told by a younger friend that all instructions for items like this are now online. Yes, it's great that it saves paper but I was desperate to get some washing on. Many of the programmes are horrendously long but the 45 minute one has done a brilliant job."
178244,"I was told when leaving talktalk for another provider they would lower my broad band rate and reward me with £100 Amazon voucher. After four months I inquired about the voucher . I was told I wasn’t promised. When I mentioned I would take it further , I was told I would receive them in a month. Two months later I contacted them again . Again said I wasn’t promised but screen shot the on line chat. I was put through to a call centre in South Africa whom apologised and said a credit in my account would be credit in 24 hours and I could request this. I followed there instructions, received an email the next day to inform me my account was £78 credit because my direct debit was due . Again I requested the £78 and again email I can’t get a refund from a credit. I went back on the online chat because trying to telephone is a joke . I was told I can’t get a refund or voucher. Don’t be fooled by this company to stay with them and receive vouchers it’s all a con . Can’t wait to contact us up"
197359,"Great company,they setup P.c,A+++"
170354,"Re:
So, ""there is no need to email customers about missing parts"", in that case, the buyer must guess and try his luck. What's that hard to write a description of two rows ""doesn't come with power adapter"" or ""button X doesn't work""?! Cash Converters more items than CeX but they using description and real photos for each item. For return why only £100 covered as long return postage label issued by you? You request the buyer to arrange the return on his own fully insured, in case lost in transit you'd be out of any responsibility and the buyer have to sort out the lost parcel with courier. I have purchased from you many items, no one has come as grade listed. When I buy for example grade B item and I tell CeX that the item it's in poor condition not grade B, CeX says ""grade b means working condition"". When I tell CeX it's not grade b because the item it's full of faults, CeX says ""Grade B means cosmetic condition"" lol. Very weird way to do business selling second hand goods without description and real pictures. Again, THE BUYER MUST TRY HIS LUCK"
105124,"very nice product, very good service thank you xx"
181496,It was positive overall. The only down side for me was the poor wi-fi signal at the store which is no fault of your own. It just made the experience a little grating. But overall it wouldn’t stop me from using the service again.

144183,"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE - Sent phone off to Mazuma, and like everyone else, They offer 1 price on the website then drastically reduce once you send it to them!
Phone was in excellent condition but revised my offer to only a third because: “Our diagnostic software has flagged that the camera on your device has dark spots on the lens. Over a period of time dust particles work their way into the camera module. Often these are only obvious on a white background, nevertheless the camera module of your device will need to be replaced”
Any other companies don’t give bs like this!
I can easily sell somewhere else for way more than your insulting offer!
Feel scammed! Also frustrated as now I’m having to wait around for phone to be returned! AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE
Edit: to the reply, your robotic answer is what you send to everyone you want try pay less money to. You send the same responses to try to squeeze as much money as possible and even this reply u send to me about my review is a generic reply! Did u even read the review, like did u even check the phones.. poor poor experience I’ve told everyone I know that’s looking to upgrade to avoid Mazuma! Scammers - I do t know how you able to get away with it"
198734,First time using Very and happy with the service and product
123722,Used over many years for selling and buying. Always reliable. You once could easily find their telephone number on the website but they recently hid this facility away. If you look hard enough you can still find their number and they remain very helpful.

However, Appliances Direct has charged me £60 to make those phone calls to them. I didn’t want to call you, I had no choice as you mucked up. But I’m left paying a bill I can’t afford. So this week Appliance Direct, your the reason I can’t afford to feed me or my kids."

113175,"We were without our landline for nearly 7 weeks. Constant failures on BTs part to fix it. Multiple missed deadlines. My 85 year old Nan ran up a £20 bill phoning us while waiting for it to be fixed as she was moving and we need to do many things in relation to this.

A month after it’s fixed and we lose the landline again for another week. Now BT are refusing to confirm how much compensation we are entitled to. They refuse to tell me as my husbands name is the account but they have previously discussed it all because I am named. It feels like they make up the rules as the go along while failing to provide a service. Will be looking for a new provider I think."
134719,Ian did a great job given that he was by himself - big fridge in kitchen in 10min. Great job
190341,"Been with them nearly a year and can't wait to change broadband provider. Their router and router plug were pretty flimsy and wiring came out of plug recently so it stopped working. No broadband for a week whilst waiting in them sending another router and plug. Various problems continue and today's no connection problem has just added to the frustration. You pay a monthly fee for a poor service. They discounted £3.60 off my bill for no internet connection in a week with last time's shenanigans. Oh big deal! I still had to top up my phone even more so than usual, to be able to actually work. Abysmal service. Just don't go there folks."

I raised a return ticket Thurs. Had to call them Friday. They were great, but couldn't arrange pick up until Mon. It's now Friday a week later and I have only just heard that they have received it, and no sign of a replacement yet):

I should have asked for a refund then just bought another. Then I would have had one day without a laptop rather than one week and counting.

I guess they have to check there is something wrong with it, but couldn't they remote in to check? Why would I buy it then make up a complaint a day later? Why not send a replacement asap rather than making me wait for ages because they sent out defective stock?"

I then requested a refund of £1100.00 and they said they would send a cheque to date I not still got any e mail about the issue or not even had my refund ... this is such a bad bad company and I would not advice any one to part with their cash knowing u either won't get it back, or it will delayed by 5 weeks or it be eventually sent via a cheque !"
148270,Absolute joke of a company. I ordered an iPad from them at the end of last month didn’t receive it within 14 days and still waiting on my refund. This company needs closed down!!!
133327,"Delivered very quickly, very carefully packaged including the packing inside the PC case. Love the configurability that PCSpecialist offer, so my PC is a very quiet fast PC with room to add extra discs. Also like that they sent spare power cables and screws."
164468,"I bought a fridge shelf and in the description my model of fridge was listed as one that it would fit. When we got it it was too big and not as described. We had to cut it ourselves. It is also poor quality and flimsy. I did complain but got nowhere with their customer services. Very disappointing for the price and don't go by the description if it says it fits, this was just a universal size and certainly not ""cut to fit"" as described. We had to keep it as we had to cut it ourselves and they wouldn't let us return it then and there was no way they were going to give us any sort of refund. So basically over £15 for a cheap piece of plastic which was definitely not made to measure."
195125,"Next day delivery didn't happen, Refunding the extra cost of the expedited delivery isn't really sufficient for the inconvenience. Suggest you take the "" order in the next x minutes for next day delivery "" down if you cant keep the promise you are making as a result"

141070,"Best price I could find by £200 and the service / delivery was great, thank you. I loved the fact that I bought from an independent with actual shops (though I ordered online) and had a bargain along with good customer service. Not everything needs to come from Amazon ... support the local shops etc or we will loose them... thank you :)"
149066,"Various Engineers turning up at will at numerous arranged appointments and not as pre arranged (Afternoon only due to being Disabled), also without parts they were ment to bring with them as arranged at prior appointments. Total could not care less just doing job attitude.
Problem reported beginning of January completed about 3 weeks later due to incompetence"
166433,Superb to deal with in every level you will not be disappointed!!!
108128,Terrible service. Can’t connect to the internet and when I do the picture quality is atrocious. Tried to return to where I bought it but it was a subscription based so I couldn’t return
146459,My experience was very good! I got updated alot on where my package is and when it will come. It took about a week to come which is very good in these times of the virus. Other than that it was good.

I forgot to add that i had multiple issues and for someone to know how to transfer from one department to the other and even came out with a profit by buying my old phone made my day."

138336,"The ipad supplied was advertised as unlocked but in fact it had remote management embedded in to it which did not come to light until I erased it and attempted to set my wife up on it.

Music Magpie have refused to help because it is outside the warranty period even though this is a breach of statutory rights (goods not as described).

I intend to notify trading standards."
128601,I sent off my iPhone 11 Pro Max. I had been advised £315 for it in used condition (minor wear and tear). This was not processed within one day due to their convenient ‘delays’. I was then told due to ‘deep scratches’ it would need a screen replacement and had been devalued to £110. I called to discuss this and dealt with a curt and impolite woman on the phone. I had been advised in a shop that the condition I sent the phone off in was perfectly acceptable and that the scratches were considered wear and tear and could be polished out. I’m now extremely concerned about what condition Mazuma Mobile will return the phone in but luckily I did take photos
143772,"Advertise next day delivery. Email it would be delivered the following Saturday or Monday. I phoned and gave an alternative address as I knew I would not be here in those days.
Next email tells me it would be delivered Tuesday and we were not here and they did not deliver to the alternative address. Hopefully I have rescheduled and someone will pat attention!"

183242,"Good price, quick delivery. What more can I say?"
141640,"First and foremost, I am not a Vodafone customer.

Someone used my identity to take out a couple of contracts with Vodafone.
Despite me raising this directly with them, they still felt it was appropriate to chase me for debt (which I specifically asked them not to do and they agreed).
This has led to a negative impact on my credit rating. I had a letter from the fraud team to confirm that they have identified it (correctly) as fraud and the contracts have been cancelled and I wouldn't need to worry anymore about it.

I called to complain about the impact on my credit rating and the customer services representative I spoke to was awful. Initially they tried to transfer me to the fraud team when I described the issue with the debt collection, but the fraud team wouldn't take the call.
Due to the manner in which the person spoke to me and their outright refusal to help, I asked to speak with someone else. They then lied to me, telling me that their system does not allow them to transfer calls (despite already trying to put me through to the fraud team).

I then raised a complaint through resolver, which Vodafone immediately undermined by setting up something on their own complaints system and tried pushing me towards. They have this far refused to respond to anything on resolver.
The person that has been responding to me has failed to understand that my complaint is mainly about the failure of the non-fraud departments I've spoken to and they are refusing to comment on it saying that I need to contact the fraud team.

This company is a joke and they deserve the overall 1.3 star rating."
193697,Initially sent an incorrect part having ordered a Lamona freezer draw flap. A call soon sorted the issue and I was then sent the correct part that fits perfectly. Both times the part perfectly packaged.
134465,"Good price on Dewalt boots
Fast delivery"
143478,Easy to communicate with the Customer Services advisors
183011,"First class service, very helpful and always available."
177631,"OK when things are OK. But if anything goes wrong you'll be in a LOT of trouble - their Customer Services are AWFUL.
I sold the house, submitted my readings and paid the final bill. Over 6 months later, they sent me a bill for >£600, payable within 7 days and with no explanation.
I argued with them for months during which time they harassed me for payment, threatened me with their debt collectors, told me they had 'evidence' and 'proof' that my readings were wrong but wouldn't give me details, told me they were following 'regulations' but wouldn't give me details, and refused to answer any of my questions about what had happened.
So I didn't know the regulations and didn't know their evidence - they just kept telling me that they had decided that I was guilty and must pay.
Eventually I went to the Ombudsman who found in my favour, made them cancel the bill and pay me compensation. Shell appealed and lost again.
So use anybody else - I've used Green Energy, Octopus and am with Avro - no problems. Just don't use Shell."
151405,"Absolute b*****rds. I recently upgraded my phone and was offered £80 for my old phone if I traded it in with Carphone Warehouse. The phone was kept in a protected case with a screen protector, when I took it out to trade in it was in perfect condition. Just got an email saying that after inspection the screen is damaged and they'll give me a fiver for it! I've looked online and this is a very common scam, you know they'll be selling it for over 20x what they've offered. Scumbags. Also, one a separate note, stop f****ng calling me with unsolicited sales rubbish"
114154,"The delivery drivers were very helpful, I have steep stairs to my property and they delivered it to the room I requested."
171486,Phone them up 2 days ago and thay gave me details out to third parties. Since then i received 20+ cold calls.

The PC was ready and delivered in 3 days, which was perfect for the days I was off work.

The service and amount of information provided was great, they are always incredibly helpful.

This is the 3rd system I've bought from PC specialist over 7 years and I'll continue use them!"
124795,"Absolutely disgusting customer service. I cannot come to words with how appalled I am with how this cowboy firm is ran. I’ve had no Broadband for over two weeks now. Every single time I call up it’s a different excuse from an operator, and guess what? A different fault!!
I asked to have a BT 4G Mini hub sent out last week in order to compensate me of this mess, to call up again tonight only to have a operator tell me there has been no such order and cannot order it for me since I don’t have an “add on package”, even though a line manager approved this last week on Thursday.

The most criminal part is that even when I had WIFI, I’ve been getting 300KB/PS for £33 a month. Absolutely shocking I cannot believe it.

After asking to speak to yet again, another manager, the operator sarcastically said “I don’t know who my manager is, most likely michael from Stockport” after asking for his last name, he said “I can’t give you that, just know it’s michael from Stockport”. I cannot tell you how shocking this company is ran. Disgusting service, disgusting rates and most of disgusting broadband."
147990,"Always great deals, always a painless experience. And so happy all my orders are in one place in case I ever loose anything."
156516,"Quick honest service, much faster WiFi thank you. Keep up the good work. JACKLYN"
139725,"Do not even bother. Save yourself time and money and go somewhere else right now. Was excited to set up my first contract but was very quickly ripped off and left with no help and an absolutely disgusting customer service team, complaints team and even the manager I spoke to. Contract was set up online with a 9.99 upfront cost and set at £40 a month, I thought that seemed great, got the email receipts and order confirmation. And then I checked my bank, they had taken £120 more than was agreed upon and have have no explanation as to why this happened. Only scripted apologies and staff who couldn't care less. I now have to wait 28 days for a cheque to arrive and a further 7 days to cash it. And this is after them even admitting they had taken more than they should have and have no clue why. No offer of a card transfer, or even to send the cheque first class. If it wasn't for their brand name I would be reporting them to trading standards and having them investigated for fraud. But like most top name companies, they care very little about their customers. I honestly wish I had never been directed to this company in the first place and wish i could sent the phone and tear up the contractan. And havve had to apply for fraud investigation to be carried out by my bank. Lots of hassle. No help from them. Every person I spoke to doesn't even deserve the pay cheque they get each month for the terrible service they provide. Worst experience ever."
176449,"Delighted with my recent purchase of a fire suite.
Would definitely recommend studio for quality goods at reasonable prices"
142121,"Can you guys stop calling me? I have been receiving calls from these guys quiet frequently. Even when I mentioned them that I am not interested in anything, they keep calling me.

I don't know how they got hold of my number. I had never done any business with them in the past.

Last time I asked them to delete my number and any information about me. And that guy said he would delete my information. After a month, I am now starting to get calls from them again. Potential breach of GDPR."
101685,"Happy I found this company, they come and unplumbed my old washing machine and took it to recycle. Hassle free and worth the money."

My complaint is now registered with cicas and I am waiting for a response. another problem is my dowload speed is now at 7.39 and upld 15.40!! like many others keep getting passed from one dept to another, if it wasnt sad it would be a comedy.
AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
153042,"Tried to help my very elderly neighbour (92) with hearing difficulties to report a fault , V6 box not working, he could not remember any old passwords, or bank details, or find last bill, surely him calling on Virgin phone with account number should have been enough.
Why why has he have to prove who he is, plus young lad laughing at his lack of memory, only said they would check it out not send an Engineer, he is paying £86 per month for this, the least they could do is send an Engineer to fix his problem, no respect for elderly clients.
I am a long time Virgin customer 25 years plus and found this experience helping my neighbour very disappointing,"
191013,"Excellent service, easy shopping experience."
170664,Great service and delivery time top notch 👍🏻
198506,"I received an email saying my phone had more than 3 scratches on the screen and, as a result, they were reducing the amount they would pay from £560 to £435 (which I rejected). I then received a second offer for £460. The phone had no scratches. I took photos of the phone before sending it as proof (its a shame I can't upload them to this review.) Reading other reviews I believe this is tactics used by Mazuma to pay less for your device - why barter and make multiple offers if it wasn't? What makes it worse is I paid for special delivery to send it and have had to pay £7.50 for it to be returned to me (as the insurance on their free option was insufficient.)

I suspect, given the iPhone 14 goes on sale tomorrow they no longer want to pay as much for older models."
102957,"Been using by sport in my business since it’s started Finally had enough of these rip off merchants. Every year they give a discount and then remove it without telling you, you negotiate a new cost but they have you by the balls for the month they have already billed you for. Try calling them and it’s a premium number that’s just cost me another £12 for the pleasure of having an arrogant so called retention person telling you if you remove by sports you’ll have to put your prices down. Finally managed to get the email address I needed to send the cancellation notice after 12 minutes of sales banter that turned aggressive. Don’t bother using them, they all need sacking or going back to basics of customer service."
167138,Still waiting for them to be delivered. Rubbish service.
107265,"Spent 1 hour on hold waiting yesterday, engineered booked - no show, no call. Got through after 1.5 hours to talk to someone from Shell- but then got cut off. Called again, spent another hour on hold, assured someone would call back within 3 hours. No call back!
Then spent another hour today trying to get through, finally phone picked up, was told that they wouldn’t take my call as I was driving. Explained that I wasn’t driving as my partner was driving. The shell representative was adamant and rude and told me that I was driving. Again, I said I wasn’t, my partner was. We both spoke to him to confirm this as we were on hands free. He was adamant to end call and quite frankly I think he couldn’t be bothered. Laughter from his end, we didn’t find this amusing. But agreed we would pull over. He said he still wouldn’t be able to speak to us as one of us is driving?! Our car only has one steering wheel. He hung up on us and even while we were pleading that we have spent a total of almost 5 -6 hours on hold over the last 48 hours with shell and still not progressed our enquiry. Ofcom where are you??!!! Shut them down and tell them to stick to petrol stations #juststopshellenergy"
107103,"Fast delivery, there's never any problems with WEX."

113608,"Second review following the 17th call to BT due to internet going down to be told it’s now on the wrong Chanel?! This is a new “issue”! It’s so concerning to think of the size of this company yet the utter incompetence!

BT please don’t give me the typical automated response of “we are sorry you are experiencing these issues please head over to Facebook or twitter”
Instead please ask your managers to head over to competence training and give customers the service we pay for!"

162345,"The item I wanted appeared back in stock. I ordered it online and asked for delivery to my chosen store, as there is not always someone in to receive where I live. I was then kept updated with my order by email and once it arrived at the store (less than a week later), I was able to collect it quickly and easily. This is the second time I have used the ""click and collect"" service. Would highly recommend it."

133545,Excellent service. Good phone with a cheap contract. Arrived on time as promised.
101319,"Initially, this ""WiFi"" enabled system was ribbish, sold as 100 mbps with a guaranteed 50 but struggled to exceed mid 30s at the router and much less throughout the house, excused by ""we dont guarantee WiFi speed"". Constant readings sent to senior CS forwarded to the tech dept resulted, although it took 14 days, a techie working with me to test everything piece by piece. The results of reseting the router took some hours to work but we then had the speeds expected of this sytsem. SO - dont wright off the system as I did until you've hounded senior CS into getting a techie on the job. Had I settled for the first line of CS / support getting this sorted would not have happened."

110391,Do not use them. My data was leaked in the Optus thing. Money was taken from my account through this company. I have sent over 70 emails including proof it wasn’t me who made the transaction. STILL they won’t refund and are now blaming my bank. I have spoken to my bank and the fraud department of my bank and I have sent evidence to them and they still say it will take 5-7 days for refund YET they can take my money from an account not even using a real email address. My bank has said as soon as the funds are returned it will clear. They are saying no it’s my banks fault. Well I’ll believe a bank over a company listed in the UK yet the bank accounts are in Lithuania and NOW I’m getting emails from a Chinese account asking for more details to prove I deserve a refund. Absolute scum bags… HOW CAN I GIVE A RECEIPT NUMBER IF I DIDNT ORDER WHATEVER IT WAS!! They even said my email wasn’t linked to an account which is f$&king obvious BECAUSE I DONT HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH THESE PEANUTS
178355,Not a very good experience where initially the website could not get our correct address so I had to phone which took a long time to get to speak to someone. From there the person I dealt with assured me that he had manually put in the correct address then the delivery failed on Friday 11/11/2022 by DPD as they claim they do not have the full address. They are apparently trying to deliver again on Monday 14/11/2022 but I do not know how that will work with the same incomplete information? If it does not arrive on Monday 14/11/2022 then I will cancel the order.
122365,Since upgraded to the faster broadband it has been amazing been very faster and quicker
115920,Delivered in much less than 24 hours by two very helpful delivery men. Competitively priced - far superior to any of the other white goods/electrical suppliers!

129888,"Online support about the suitability for me, ie Windows 10 and would it function on Windows 11. This enabled me to go ahead with the purchase.

When trying to register with Samsung turns out Currys don't support Samsung warranty so total lie and not valid, also when phoning Currys customer service to query turns out we have free 5 year extended with Currys warranty which should have been confirmed to us in the shop by Joseph instead of which he tried to sell us one instead, not good!!"

114344,"I bought my daughter a laptop in august for her university work. Took out Currys Care and Repair plan at the same time. Last night she switched the laptop on and a large part of the top righthand of the screen was blank and there were lines running through much of the rest of the screen. Phoned Care and Repair this morning who told me to take it to nearest store (Falkirk) The assistant there instantly diagnosed the problem as ""Accidental damage"" no ifs or buts. hence we wouldnt be able to claim through care and repair.
The laptop was last used on Thursday and everything was fine. It sits, as always on a table, with nothing on or around it. It hasnt fallen, been dropped etc and has no sign of any damage what so ever on the casing. Reading the small print on the care and repair docs doesnt actualy define what accidental damage is so seems to me Currys has quite a good get out of jail free card in regards to their obligations regarding Care and Repair"

153392,I brought the new GHD Unplugged for my wife as a valentines gift. They were delivered 24hrs after purchase and they certainly didn't disappoint her. She absolutely loves them and despite the cost they were worth every single penny as I am certainly in the good books 😁. I would certainly recommend not only the straighteners ( according to my wife) but the company and delivery time.

Bought from Currys PC World and Team Don’t Know How have failed to deliver in the 3 slots we’ve been given so far, with all the excuses in the world on each occasion: “No trained installers today”; “No straps for us to carry it with us today in the truck”; “The product got damaged in the truck or the warehouse”. No customer service email. The chat bots can’t understand the simplest of sentences. The phone lines keep you waiting the best part of an hour and then they put you on hold to waste your time for another half an hour before picking up again and hanging up. I have never been treated with such disdain by so many employees of the same company - it must be their company policy. I have been polite and respectful at all times and two separate customer services people have hung up on me in one day without solving the problem. ONE PURCHASE, 15 HOURS OF MY LIFE WASTED AND COUNTING."

I contacted snapfish via the chat function as the phone number on the website says it's not a real number when you call it. I was promised a replacement mug, and I checked they knew which one I needed. Sure enough the replacement arrived - THE WRONG MUG from my order was replaced. I went to the chat again and was told a supervisor would email that same day to resolve the issue. No email. Chat again - promised an email again - and still no email or useable mug (intended as a gift)."
188773,"Knowhow
What Can I say about team knowhow I have been paying for a warranty on my American Style Fridge Freezer for 7yrs it broke down and they wrote it off.
All to that point good then I get a text to say I Needed to call them and was told that my warranty had expired Not. Very sorry You are. Not
Sorry not good enough as I reported this on the 20th of Feb so they had start the process all over again its 1st March Three children to care for and In mean time life is made very difficult by this company and there warranty and the Incompetence is staggering.
As warranty lapsed and then Auto renewed but as a tech company couldn't even get a basic right.
Plus had to chuck £150 to £200 food out and we have three children here and anyone with children would know how difficult it is to keep them happy food wise without this appliance.
Needless to say I would never get a warranty from them again as all in honesty they just don't care as long as they taking your money then that's fine but when things go wrong they just don't care please please if you need a warranty get it from anywhere else but not from Team KnowHow..One Very Unhappy Customer..."

I called up to be told it had gone to the courier and that it was a 2 man job and that can take 48 hours. Updates from courier good but did not start receiving them until 2 days after ordering. Item arrived 3 days after ordering and not the next day as advertised on the site. Ebuyer need to change the delivery details on this item as there was no way it was going to arrive next day and they knew which courier they would be using and how they operate. Customer Services were good and emailed an update after I called but was left waiting for a day for the item that never materialised"

I did have a long wait time (maybe 35 - 45 minutes) which was far too long. I do appreciate this is a very busy time for you and that there are reasons (shortage of workers) for why you may not have the staff needed, but I feel that is a definitive area for improvement."

Have had countless calls, requests to reboot my box, an engineer visit, request for photos to be emailed to customer service and now, another box posted to me. All the while, dodging my request for a refund for the last three months. Finally got through to someone today to discuss this and they were only authorised to credit £50 to my account so I need to waste more time calling again in the week. Surely, considering an engineer has actually seen for themselves that the channels are not working, a refund would have been offered in full without the need to constantly chase?!
Beyond frustrated at this point although if nothing else, the customer care team have all been really polite."
117689,"Intermittent service for two weeks with no resolution. Basically making any working from home, Netflix etc completely useless! - we had to use our phone hotpots for Teams meetings!

They sell you the line 'if you lose service, we'll pay you £100' but fail to tell you that's for THREE DAYS OF COMPLETE SERVICE LOSS!!! So if they get even the slightest whisper of a signal during that period, no compensation! - Absolute scam! They then wave their extortionate (hundreds of pounds) cancellation fee in your face.

Avoid at all cost, they screw you in every way possible!

Cue the generic reply!!!

""Hi Jon,

Thank you for your review. We're sorry... bla bla bla""

No, it IS the level of service you DO provide, no I don't want to call because it is a waste of time, I've done it on many an occasion, and I can tell you do not want to help me fix it... If you cared, you'd own up to this, compensate and say hey, ""we messed up, we understand why you want to leave, we'll waive the cancellation fee..."" will that happen??...

I realise my contract is up for renewal but I refuse to do this over the phone, not long out of hospital after surgery and not well enough to deal with this constant harassment, emailed to make a complaint and got a generic email response, not good enough, you didn't even comment in your response about the obvious non social distancing in your call centre. You informed me that I wouldn't be bothered again but you are still phoning me, what part of NO MORE do you NOT understand???
I can't understand any of them, they don't even have the politeness to tell me who is calling, all I get is: oh my name is so and so and how are you today, I'd be much better if you left me alone, the call centres they call from obviously don't do social distancing as you can hear about 300 people all talking at once in the background, I'm completely fed up with them"

Vodafone tried to install it at the wrong address, despite many desperate phone calls from me explaining their mistake, then vodafone cancelled the order and charged me £97 for cancelling the contract early.

I told them where to shove it and asked for it to be returned to me. Now on their website, they are now offering £126 for grade A phone so because they had devalued the brand/ model they claimed the scratch on mine. When it comes back to me and there's a scratch on it , there can only be one place it occurred, probably intentionally. Totally untrustworthy. Avoid like the plague!"

Disappointing Experience. I tried to pickup a new iPhone today that had been delivered to the store. Online agent confirmed delivery date and the in-store sales person confirmed arrival.
However I’m not allowed to take the phone until the store has opened my delivery, added it to the system and text me…
It’s a shame as online and over phone Vodafone agents are very good indeed.
I wouldn’t advise wasting time with their high street stores if this is anything to go by."

115542,"Signed up for this new offer of £14.99 a month but little did i know what a nightmare it would turn into…
I’m a new user to Now TV and after subscribing i’ve got charged twice this month for Boost £5 from my bank account without prior notification. Spoke to multiple agents on live chat, no results. Got no refund! On Friday spoke to an agent which promised me that i’d be charged £4.99 for Entertainment and the rest £5 would be taken from my credit on my account. Yesterday they charged me the £4.99 plus £5 for Cinema. Checked my Now account and i had 0 credit there. I’ve been lied to and manipulated into an offer that hasn’t been explained properly when i signed up. I guess that’s how they make their money by making people fall for their “offer” when in reality it’s a total rip off. Yesterday i tried again to speak to not one but two agents on live chat. The first guy took so long that eventually the chat ended due to time out. The second one ended up the same. They trying to justify what i’ve been charged for saying that £5 was meant to be for Entertainment when i could clearly see on my bank transaction that i’ve been charged for cinema Twice this month. They do have a contact number but they don’t take any accountability for anything instead they make you go and chat with a useless agent on a trash chat that doesn’t even let you finish the conversation.
This company is Trash/Garbage. I’m going to escalate it to someone higher up since i’ve got no results from a regular agent.
I only signed up for this to watch House of Dragons which with the offer sounded pretty decent but too good to be true as afterwards they would take all your money from your bank account.
Avoid like plague, this is not worth it. It’s a trash service where everyone is trying to avoid you.
One star is too much for them i’d give Zero stars if i could."

143306,"I made a terrible mistake by going for price when signing up for NowTV but did not pay much attention to what other people were saying about this company.

They may be cheap, granted, but my experience doesn't suggest they are cheerful (!) as I have had loads of problems with NowTV Broadband since I made the fatal mistake of signing up with them back in Feb 2022. I get dropouts on a daily basis and when it is actually working, the speeds are not that great.

At first I thought it was down to the very basic router they supplied but I have replaced this with another one but am still having problems.

I will be leaving as soon as I can get out of my contract - yes, it's that bad.

So where am I going? Back to Plusnet as I had very few issues with this company. In my opinion you may pay a little more but they are 100 x better than NowTV.

182540,"So paradoxically I originally marked this down because you are too efficient! I placed an order and only noticed after submitting it that the stored address was my old one. I instantly went into the account to cancel the order but it was already being processed. There is no way to contact the company by phone. The 'live chat' was ineffective, they were apparently unable to change the order status. Fortunately as the order was being delivered by courier I was able to divert to a pick up point. It would be very helpful if the order system incorporated a delay to allow changes or cancellations.
UPDATE: very quick response, issued refund and will look into the issue raised. Good to know. I have used eSpares quite a lot and have always had quick service."
137736,"Shabby at best. Fridge freezer delivery confirmed for 8-10am delivery Christmas Eve - didn’t turn up. Live chats / emails / phone calls ignored all day.
Sales team open today (3days later) - but again customer services team unavailable on live chat / email / phone. No
Communication at all - paid for product and delivery in full.
Read other reviews on here."
100388,"Esma T was so calm, patient and reassuring. 10/10 service. Thank you Esma!"
133025,Well well well..... NOW TV. Had to cancel my subscription because they constantly take money from your account. It was happening every week.
159030,Issue resolved & new prints were given very quickly. Many thanks. Fab prints
110278,Same as everyone else. Had a service with Apple on my iPhone 12 Pro just before I upgraded. Sent to mazuma expecting 410 payout. They email me some rubbish about the usb not connecting to their software and offered 150 quid for the phone. Don’t trust this company this is the second time this has happened to me now. Asked for my phone back asap and then they say it could take 3-5 days.
194075,I sold a broken iPad to Mazuma. They guarantee a price and the whole process was straightforward and easy. I can recommend them.
196610,Quick fast easy and superb for someone who can't afford a contract or buy out right im chuffed and great service will definitely use again.
139401,"Delivery drives we friendly, helpful and put my appliances where I needed them"
199976,Exceptional service particularly with technical advice following purchase. I thoroughly recommend this company. I shall use them again.
114287,"Very fast delivery, seemed to progress over the weekend so we got the dehumidifier earlier than expected. So far no issues with the unit. I would say it was on the top end of the domestic scale, but suits our home and needs very well, so maybe we needed a bigger one."
123442,Brilliant product and fast delivery. Very happy with this service.
148903,"Horrible, vile company. Refused to write off £11.73 on my Mums Broadband account after she died, despite her spending the final 2 months of her.life.in hospital, instead charging me right up till the day I informed them and sending me a bill over 2 months later."
115937,"Awful experience start to finish attempting to get BT broadband activated, have now cancelled and gone with virgin media.

They initially told us an activation date of Friday August 5th, after 2 phone calls to confirm this date, nothing happened that day. I rang and spoke to someone who apologised, said the 5th was tentative, as it was conditional on openreach agreeing, and it had now been firmly booked in with open reach for the following Wednesday 10th. On me asking, he confirmed this was a firm date.

No activation on the 10th. Another phone call - it turned out that open reach hadn’t even received the order. BT seems to have a completely dysfunctional supplier relationship with open reach and doesn’t communicate with them properly. They also refuse point blank to escalate issues like this, so you go straight to the back of the queue when BT’s incompetence misses your activation. It was then promised that the work would be the following Wednesday. That didn’t happen, it turned out this needed an open reach check the following day. On the Friday we called again - now exactly 2 weeks late - it was stated that an engineer visit would now be needed, this would take 3 days, and the internet wouldn’t be live until the end of the week following that.
This despite A. Consistent assurances this wouldn’t be needed, since we were going away so had asked repeatedly if a visit was needed and B. the previous occupants of the flat having used BT broadband themselves.
This was the point at which I cancelled - had they been transparent about how long it would take I would have cancelled some time before and had service with virgin earlier.

Consistent over promising by customer services for 2 weeks - always just a couple days more - presumably in an attempt to put people off cancelling. I should also emphasise that almost all the above issues were only communicated to us after we phoned them for an update - they are not at all proactive in contacting customers. Seemingly they do not care in the least about basic customer service, and trade only off customer inertia and them being a well known brand."
155763,Completely wasteful packaging 28x28x21cms for a tiny lens hood which should have come in a Jiffy bag. Had to collect from depot when expecting it to be put through letterbox.
119558,Easy process to design and order. Finished product was just what I wanted.
123716,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!
Would give no stars if I could. Ordered phone which didn’t come, so after 10 days I emailed them as you can’t get them on the phone, they told me it would be at least another 5 days for the phone to be despatched. I cancelled and said I want a full refund which they told me would take up to 14 working days. Once the 14 days were up I was told I wouldn’t get a refund until on or before the 15th April, which at the time was over a month away. Here we are the 15th April and still no refund. Total Micky mouse company 😡"
117371,I would give no star if possible! Bought IPhone 9 months ago and now I keep getting a temperature gauge at red hot saying phone is too hot to use. Then this afternoon it started with temperature gauge and a high pitched sound that even scared my dog. Obviously this phone is DANGEROUS and all carphone warehouse can do is send it back to Apple and will take 10 to 28 working days. I asked for replacement but of course answer was NO. I will never ever deal with them again.
192160,"If your mother could not dial 999 from a landline how would you feel? Almost 4 WEEKS without a phone for an Elderly Lady due to BT's blunders switching to Digital Voice.

I'm usually appreciative but Honestly the WORST experience I've had with a company.

Our phone has been switched from land line to BT Digital Voice on Jan 9th when we had broadband installed. In that time:

- Copper Landline removed and no longer works so our phone is dead (they should have left it as a back up )
- Digital Voice never worked and still doesnt (so we have no new phone)
- Support staff say there is a fix in progress and will call us back, they do not call us back , so we keep going round in circles everytime we call
- No manager or senior person will take the call,there is no accountability and we have no point of contact to manage the case

I've NEVER seen a company perform this badly and do not recommend BT for phone or anything else. I will be taking this further!"
194151,"Had to wait a week for the dishwasher - but the guy who removed the old one and fitted the new was a gem.
He was calm, organised and polite. Really impressed"
129424,"Good product and very good service, kept informed at all times when my item would be delivered. Delivery drivers were helpful. Arrived quickly."
172594,"Ordered from PartsCentre after original supplier failed to deliver parts after 3 weeks, despite saying they were in stock.
Ordered placed and delivered within a few days, no fuss, just a reliable service. Thanks."
128303,"Website was easy, ordered new washing machine, plenty of communication from the company, fixed delivery for the next day, was given a 2 hour slot for next morning, 30 minute warning from driver, machine delivered by two polite, helpful men. All in all an easy and cost effective experience. Thank you."
122727,"Our broadband service has been down for 17 days . I reported it on day one and was told it would be fixed remotely .Eventually after 2 weeks an engineer is trying to resolve..why couldnt BT arrange this when I first reported a fault ?
No apology from BT. I am spending hours every day trying to speak to someone to get it resolved . No one at BT customer service cares about the customer experience . Truly awful service ,yet they are still billing me for a service they are not providing. Zero stars"
190257,"Excellent service, would recommend to all."
151923,"Installation service so poor.
Fist they didn’t show up then received email saying they can’t access?? It’s lie as it’s 15 builder working inside. 2nd time they booked at 8till 2 end it up it’s turn up 7 didn’t know what to do as we waited so long time to install we have rush to leave upstairs which wasn’t plan. I end it up have payed some one to connect where supposed to be cost £200 it’s poor service."
128465,"Quick, easy and provides updates frequently"
199765,"I bought a graphics card from ebuyer on Saturday 14/1/2023. It was delivered today. I then noticed afterwards that there is a 10% off code for ebuyer on their ebay channel which puts the card at just over 30 pounds cheaper.

I went on the ebuyer website to see their ""noble"" price match guarantee.

I called their advisor who told me that unfortunately ebuyer cannot pricematch against themselves and the only way to get the cheaper price would be to return the card (and reimbursing the cost myself) and then repurchase the card from their ebay channel.

This is unacceptable and a dishonest business practice. I would not recommend Ebuyer.com to anyone.

Update:
After further correspondence with ebuyer (Amy below and her colleague), they have confirmed that they cannot price match “eBay” - even though ebuyer are the seller.

This is because eBay are the ones offering the 10 percent code. Well, to profit from this 10 percent code- ebuyer have suddenly hiked their eBay price of the card up. It costs more on their eBay originally (before the discount code) vs their own site.

All these practices are of a very dishonest business, who puts their own profit over any credibility or right to do by their customers. I will be actively discouraging others offline and online to purchase from ebuyer.

A terrible company that does not deserve your business!"
170048,"Easy to use, quality very good and very quick delivery. Thoroughly recommend!"
145734,Excellent service so quick and fast sent it by special delivery on the Tuesday money was in my bank on the Wednesday so quick and easy to do
169238,"I have been using this company for years for other phones I have purchased over the years and they have always dealt with my inquiry in the right correct manner and there prices are really good , they are doing a really good job through the padamic atm and its must be tough on everyone but there customer service is excellent"
171979,"All I want is to get another contract for my broadband. The person has lied about the costs - the confirmatory email bore no resemblance to the costs quoted on the phone. Also, I said I just wanted to stay the same. Instead, BT has trespassed on my property, installing some cable, which I have tried to pull up and thought about removing with my garden secateurs. They want to install fibre which I do not want. I don't want engineers in my house. I will not let them in. I am so angry and feel so powerless. I am frightened by this all happening without my consent."
156582,"New router we pay more for was temperamental. Remote didn’t work, neither did replacement. Wrong channels loading, despite paying for HD & raised a complaint then heard nothing back. Still waiting for compensation. Absolute shambles."
151680,Prompt response to my telephone calls and prompt despatch.I received all items the day after ordering and found just as described.Thank you. H ROBBINS
112454,I wouldn’t give this 1 star if I could .I cancelled my subscription over a year ago to find they’ve still been charging me £15 a month they have admitted I haven’t used my account yet don’t give refunds and no contact number for a actual person instead of robot chat says it all. its a scam robbing you for old rubbish movies years old. don’t bother with it nextfil is so much better and more helpful in any situation.Fuming!!
110116,"I bought and paid for the installation of a Samsung washing machine. When the delivery came, they told me that I needed to book a disconnect. All my previous installations included a disconnect and I didn't think they were separate for this service. I contacted their customer service at that time. They were unable to book the disconnect service separately, so they arranged a full refund. I am very satisfied with the customer service. You can buy from them with peace of mind."
168930,Easy to order. Description clear and accurate. Delivered within 5 days. Product as described. Good quality and value for money.
100559,"Absolute brilliant service from start to finish and had a new washer delivered, installed within 5 days and took my old one and disposed of it.
Will be highly recommending to everyone to cover their household items!!!"
168517,"The whole experience was perfect from start to finish, ease of ordering our electrical goods, the delivery was very prompt, with plenty of notice and updates. Finally, we had two friendly, polite gentlemen who brought and placed our items in, unpacked our range cooker and removed the packaging. Brilliant, thank you!"
135026,So pleased with the Gtech Hoover. Powerful and so light and easy to use. The added bonus is not having to change the settings from carpet to floor when using.
178993,The photos are good quality and came in good time. I would use them again.
144235,"VIRGINS SUPER SLOW
INTERNET.

Still got super slow internet and they still haven’t bothered to contact me, just wondering if I can get a discount on my monthly payments as I'm not getting what I’m paying for.

Hi Beth

Thank you for your reply but I’ve tried so many times and can’t get through it would be good for them to contact me 07834538786

Thank you simon"
158266,Waited in 3 times for a delivery & TV did not arrive. Was fed a string of excuses. In the end a manager had to deliver it. Very poor service as I am a pensioner and was recovering from a fall so this was most unhelpful.
146479,"Very disappointed, ordered phone for birthday, son wanted a specific older model, I made sure I left a weeks leeway due to lock down. As date approached I got no emails so contacted them and was told there may be a slight delay of a few days, this was acceptable. The delay turned to almost two weeks, not acceptable so I cancelled the order May 1st and was told a refund would take up to 15 working days and here we are 16th June and still no refund. Quote from email after chasing them ""I have requested our finance department to look into your order and they have advised that you will be receiving your refund on or before the 10th of June."" After more chasing I got this ""We have processed your refund on the 10th of June."" So who the hell could the refund be in my account on or before the date they processed the refund. They started to blame the bank for a 7 day processing time, interestingly another refund agreed Friday 12th June was in my bank Monday 15th June. I cant say whether Quick Mobile fix goods are any good as I didn't receive any but if their customer service is anything to go by I would give these guys a complete miss as Im still waiting my refund over 6 weeks now."
120715,"Great service.
Unfortunately the PC didn't work due to a failure to start up.
Was returned and when received back worked fine.
No fuss or problems with the return and repair which is much appreciated."
173452,"We were served by a very polite person, she explained about extra insurance cover and all we needed to know. The o lying issue was the long wait in the queue due to lack of staff."
183286,"Paid £16 for a takeaway food was cold had a refund of 0.95 so I said that was an insult so they refunded £1
Awful customer service will not use again"
131781,"Website was easy to navigate and select the required components. Making changes to the order was easy and enabled me to select additional components.
Was kept fully aware of the progress with my order, support was very helpful with providing information. Packaging was good and solid, however one of the handles on the box could have been stronger and was slightly damaged, but the PC was well protected from any damange with foam inserts and a foam insert within the case.
The PC functions brilliantly well, and the build quality and attention to detail is exceptional.
Would be delighted to use PC Specialist again!"
170021,Never get the speeds we pay for. It’s only ever half of what we’re promised (at best). I also had an account setup over the phone and was unable to access the account online. I’ve tried registering a new account to be told an account is already created under that email. I’ve tried changing the password only to be told no account with that email exists. Customer service is great when you can get through to them but getting through in the first place is a nightmare. They make it so hard to find the phone number on their webpage and constantly redirect you to the same useless help pages. No thought for the customer experience
192430,"I LOVE using the snap fish app, so easy to use and really great quality"
130522,It was easy to fine the product on line and picking it up was easy too.
177741,"the washing machine I got as a replacement was a good price and the same type, the delivery date was also spot on."
128347,Item delivered earlier than expected which is always a bonus and just before Christmas.
195542,"Appointment was easy and quick to book, Candy engineer attended was ver good, told me what the problem was ordered nee parts for it and even fixed a new problem. Parts arrived next day Tumble dryer is now good as new."

195614,"Well may just say first THANK YOU!....... I had been look near and far for the 60gb ipod classic for a very long time with no hope of finding one but found in perfect condition plus in next to no time it was at my door so you'd better get used to me buying alot more items
Yours sincerely.

116196,"My husband and I have both used Snapfish several times before and been really happy with everything we’ve ordered. On this last occasion however, we ordered a desk calendar as a Christmas present. Although the original images used were of our black dog, some of which were taken on bright sunny days, some of the images on the calendar are blurred and so dark that it is almost impossible to see what the image actually is. We feel this is down to poor production. It’s a shame as we will consider using an alternative supplier in the future as the final product did not meet our expectations."
181548,Fantastic looks great compared the old one arrived very quick top service thanks
109153,Excellent and quick service would highly recommend them
191198,Excellent next day delivery. Product well packed and in full working order. No complaints!
111594,Ease of producing the invites speed of delivery and the cost all making a perfect experience
177724,"This is the second system I've purchased from PCSpecialist. The first one was a system for our daughter as a gift when she got her 1st home.
I was impressed by the quality of the build, the packaging, and swift delivery.
So, when our son was looking for a gaming rig, my first thought was PCSpecialist again.
Their website was perfect for allowing us to try out different specs for his rig, and warning us if any component choices were mismatched. That meant we were then getting a rig's spec that suited his requirements perfectly. (which is what you want when spending c.£3,000)
The PC was delivered in time for Xmas, perfectly packaged, including internal packaging within the PC casing itself.
He is now happily running his hi-spec, SUPER quiet gaming rig.
If you're looking for PC or laptop build, give them a try.
You won't be disappointed."
133196,This is a total scam. There are no real leads. Total scam to get your money.
109004,"1 star is generous! Two months ago, my elderly father was persuaded by BT to switch to an EE 5G router, as their rural BT Broadband was terrible.
BT explained that EE was now part of BT, and there was no fee to switch over to this 5G system.
Last week, a letter from BT arrived, demanding £400 for breaking their BT contract. After numerous telephone calls to BT, the only solution was to take out a contract for a BT 5G router instead.
So my poor parents have no idea if they are to be penalised for breaking this recent EE contract.
So dishonest on BT's part, such contempt for elderly customers. BT should be utterly ashamed."
165254,Always fast delivery fantastic quality and excellent choice of fashion
137680,Very fast delivery haven't used yet as it's a Christmas present for my daughter
121462,"Appt booked easily and within a few days - Engineer Called Before Arriving, showed ID at the door, well presented - found the fault quickly, kept me informed and advised how to avoid the problem in the future."

150805,Very quick delivery. Product was as described. Well packaged.
127532,Excellent service and money transferred quicker than anticipated! And more than I was originally quoted! 👍
190787,by far the worst of any streaming services pay to be met with ads and asked for more money to get rid of them zero quality settings must pay to get higher quality complete waste of time better off using any other way of watching things
152957,"I would give no star. They never came to instal anything, did not receive by post anything. I was given a date for an engineer on 5th Oct to do whatever needed and received an email prior to date that to say engineer is not coming. Also same experience with other provider who depends on open reach and I ended up having no internet for 9 weeks. All these companies think they could force people stay with them and pay their rates in these hard times. Thats how business is made in uk and everywhere."
144542,"I made a purchase for some straighteners that had the offer of a free gift.
Half way through the sale I was offered a 10% discount as a new customer.

180044,"I would give them less stars, if it was possible. I have only just changed to Vodaphone. It is impossible to log in to the app, I presume because I am not paying enough. It has taken me round in circles for an hour.

The shop was really busy but the staff member on the shop floor very helpful, the TV I was looking for was out of stock so he ordered one to be collected within the next 2 working days. He did explain it may take a bit longer with the bank holidays (this was on Boxing day in the afternoon), however it did arrive at the store within the the 2 days. Picked up Wednesday with no fuss. Overall fast and efficient service, and customer services staff were all pleasant, efficient and knowledgable."
164917,I think overall it was a very good service. Happy with my PC! It made it easier for me to pick the components using PC specialist. The only slight complaint is that it took over a month to arrive - however I understand it is very busy.

114110,"I signed up for Talk Talks full fibre broadband on the 30th September 2022, to salesmen who called at my house. I changed my mind after I read reviews. I had been informed that I could cancel any time within 20 days without penalty and rang talk talk customer services. I was transferred somewhere in the region of eight times because they couldn't find me despite the fact that I had an order number from a welcome email. I was even warned not to cancel the direct debit as it would affect my credit rating, even though one had not yet been set up. Next I tried online chat and as soon as I said I wanted to cancel I was transferred to a site that was never answered. I then typed out a letter explaining my wish to cancel. I included my telephone number and email address and sent it by registered mail to the head of complaints at Talk Talk five days ago. Apart from the initial welcome emails I have had no further contact from Talk Talk. An engineer had been scheduled to call on the 14th on October which is now four days away. ( still well within the 20 days and they won’t be allowed in!) Talk Talk May well have cancelled my contract but if so they could have had the courtesy to have told me."

With it being an iPhone 14 I was getting worried about my payment but it did come trough. You was offering more then the likes cex and why I trought I would give you a go. My overall experience was not a good one but I got paid what I was quoted but you do need to improve a lot."
187872,"Never ever buy from here again.had a TV less than 1 year old blamed me said it had water damage !!!!!. Really its in a corner and I don't need to go there except to hoover

170098,Not perfect. There are some little stains on some pictures which they didn't come out properly. Some pics are too dark vs. original pictures. It could be better.
153431,"We switched from TalkTalk to NowTV broadband (dont seem to have their own review section) and phone about a month ago. So far, it’s been smooth sailing. The switch happened on the day as planned with no issues and the service was only off for a short period. The broadband router isn’t as strong as the TalkTalk unit it replaced, but lots of the reviews I’d read said to expect this. That said, it works, where as talktalk continually dropped the connection.

Overall, pretty happy. It’s cheaper, contracts shorter and if they try to do me over on price in 11 months time, I can always leave.

Only 4* rather than 5 as their TV service includes really irritating adverts in between the shows - which you just don’t get on other streaming services and probably will mean I cancel that part sooner rather than later."

More phone calls promising it would be resent once it got to the warehouse! Never did arrive then a few days later got a refund! Monitor has now gone up by £30.00 but as I've been refunded nothing I can do. I can buy it then phone up and quote previous order no and they will refund the difference. No thank you I don't have the time or the patience. I would give zero stars but didn't get the option to do so!"

I am paying for a package for 16/18mbps and I am getting 6.2mbps upload no where near the speed I was promised at all. My download is fine but the upload speed is trash. I have written a email with screenshots of this to them let's see their excuse as there really isn't any as we pay for what we ask for not a good start with a new customer is it. If this isn't fixed and made to stay at that speed then after my first payment I will be leaving them and never will I recommend them again or even speak about them again.

Was actively sold a handset contract.
Discovered over the weekend I was paying over the odds , so took it back on the Monday.
The manager tried every trick to try and worm his way out of cancelling.
It clearly stated I had 14 days provided I did not insert the sim or personalise the phone.
When he finally conceded that his lies were getting him nowhere.,
And being warned several times to ,""watch my attitude"" ie. The one where I'm excercing my right under his company policy, which he is smirkingly denying.
I asked him if he didn't know his own store policy, how many people had they turned away, that he shouldn't have?.

Middle of February they told me the power source had broken and they were going to write of my laptop. They sent me a code back in February that would get me a new laptop. They wouldn't tell me how much the code was worth, I had to go in store.

As the stores are shut down I've called to ask for options and been told nothing until today, when the person I spoke to said my code had no value. . . then the phone cut off.

I've been passed around different departments so many times, before this pandemic stated and afterwards. It's really terrible to treat your customers like this. Since the write off my premiums are still being charged so that 4 months without a laptop and I'm still paying Team Know How for what? It's a very bad reflection on both your brand and curries."

163935,"I can not rely on this broadband for a sustained connection. It abruptly stops working on various occasions for no reason and yet when I try contact their customer service after hours of no broadband they send a generic response saying there is a service problem and can not confirm when it will be resolved. I live in a new build development and unfortunately they are the only connected broadband. I had to leave the much more reliable sky broadband due to this. Needless to say, I will be switching at the earliest possible time.
In addition, after confirming my direct debit set up weeks earlier, they sent a message late in the night saying they could not take payment and I am being charged late payment fee. There is no issue from my bank…and who sends a threatening message to suspend services late at night. Disappointing service."

109885,"Excellent service and quick delivery.

The PC builder online is excellent, plenty of options, easy to change and loads of information. I wish the case selection was a bit wider (there's lots of options for cases with whizzy lights, but not that many for bog-standard basic cases like I want) but in general it all seems very good. The tool warns you if you've selected things that are incompatible, or if you've put in a bigger power supply than you need, which I appreciated.

I corresponded with two customer service people, one by Live Chat (asking for a bit of advice) the other by email (asking about amending my order). The guy on Live Chat was reasonably helpful - and went to the trouble of creating a new suggested build for me to try to answer my query - but ultimately I think my question confused him a bit. The lady on email was extremely helpful.

Delivery was quick (quicker than the estimate), the company kept my informed of what stage the build was at, and DPD (delivery service) gave some helpful options for amending the delivery date. So far (2 weeks after delivery) its all working perfectly and I'm very happy with it!"

114280,"I really wish I checked TrustPilot before choosing BT as my ISP, one of the worst decisions I've ever made.
I've always had lower download speeds than promised, and straight connectivity loss amounting to a couple of days per month, at least, sometimes even more.

The worst part was after I moved three months ago, they got my order wrong three times, THREE TIMES! They sent me a 4g hub and they got it wrong twice, I had to use my phone's data for work for about three weeks, after that I had to wait about a month and a half for the engineer to visit... The engineer came in but the router hadn't, had to wait another week to get it, after that it was fine for about two weeks, but guess what? They got the order wrong again! I suddenly lost connectivy and it appears I have to wait two weeks for an engineer to come and fix it.

All in all, in the past three months since I've moved, I've had broadband for about two weeks, it's an absolute joke.

Steer clear from BT!!

I wish I could get a different provider but I'm expecting a lot of trouble to terminate the contract early."
153742,"STAY FAR AWAY from their BROADBAND (and probably other services)

This is one of the worst customer services (without providing any actual service) I have seen in my life. Its been 3 months since I had applied for a broadband connection.

Till now:
- 1.5 months delay AFTER initial deadline to install, that's for first appointment.
- 2 FAKE appointments since where no one showed up (each c.2 weeks apart so extra time wasting tactics and after I took 2 leaves from work for full day)
- Currently scheduled a random 3rd appointment (which is also FAKE I assume) without even checking and when I let them know that I cant make that day and to reschedule. They don't reply, reschedule or do anything.
- Don't reply to your messages / emails / 1-2 hrs wait times on calls
- They keep transferring to random departments to avoid talking about their shambolic behavior. Some customer reps. don't even bother to pretend to care about you or your issue
- Its clear they have no understanding, knowledge or solutions to services THEY themselves provide

I wish there was a regulator to look into these literally nightmare companies who get away with treating customers / people like this. Also I doubt most positive reviews here are genuine.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED"

Came this morning with parts they thought it might be but it needs a new drum which I had explained it was the same as last time. Now having to wait yet another week. I work from home doing beauty treatments so you can imagine how many towels I go through and the laundrette is costing me a small fortune.

166932,Customer service better then other providers. Affordable price. Good internet speed. Had no trouble when was with them
190212,"On the 27th October, I was checking my aunt's phone bill and I was shocked to see she was charged for 26 123 (BT speaking clock) calls at 50p a call. My aunt has never phoned the speaking clock and she doesnt need to use her phone to find out the time. She also lives alone and no one else uses her phone.

I contacted BT the same day and spoke to a lady from Liverpool. I told her my aunt hadn't made these phone calls but the lady repeatedly told me that these calls were made and my aunt would have to pay for them. I told her that I had checked my aunt's phone call history and their was no record on there of her contacting 123. I also assured her that my aunt is fully compos mentis.

Eventually BT agreed to refund the money as a 'goodwill gesture' but they said in the future, 123 calls would have to be paid for. I told her that my aunt wasn't going to pay for calls she hadn't made, so the woman then refused to refund the money. I then asked to speak to her supervisor who agreed to refund the money but they still wernt prepared to accept the fact that my aunt hadn't made these calls.

The direct debit was also increased from £22 to £34.50 as a result of these calls but the lady assured me she would have this reduced. I also asked her if anymore 123 calls had been made since the last bill and she said one had been made on the 23rd October. She said I could ring up BT in future to check on these 123 calls.

On the 13th November, I noticed £34.50 was taken out of my aunt's account even though the lady told me the direct debit would be reduced. I phoned BT and spoke to Connor in the loyalty team. I asked him for my aunt's account balance which is now £20 in credit as a result of BT not reducing the direct debit. Connor said my aunt's monthly contract is £21.57 so I asked him to get the direct debit reduced which he said he was happy to do. £34.50 was obviously way too much to be charging my aunt. However when Connor spoke to the direct debit team, they refused to reduce the direct debit. Connor said my aunt either pays £34.50 a month or changes the contract to monthly where she pays the exact amount she owes. In normal circumstances this wouldn't bother me but this isn't normal circumstances.

BT are refusing to believe that my aunt didn't make the 123 calls and are basically threatening my aunt to change her contract else they will continue overcharging her.

It's infuriating to my aunt who believes that they are implying she's lying and are now trying to punish her, for contesting the previous charges, by trying to force her to change her contract. My aunt's had the same BT package for years and has never had any problems before. The speaking clock hasn't appeared on my aunt's bills in the past either.

I told Connor that my aunt never made the calls to 123 and like the previous person I spoke too, he said the calls had been made. I told him their are no records on the phone of 123 calls been made but he still wouldn't listen. I asked him why 123 isn't appearing on my aunts phone call history if calls had been made to the speaking clock but he said he couldn't elaborate. They have made it clear they arent willing to investigate what is causing this fault.

I asked Connor for an update on what calls had been made since the last bill but Connor said we would have to wait until January for this information. He said he can't tell us what calls have been made after the 22nd October yet the previous person I spoke too, told me their was a 123 call made on the 23rd October. The calls can obviously be checked but BT are now refusing to check these for my aunt. This is unfair because my aunt could get another expensive bill in January and BT won't give my aunt access to her own call logs in the meantime so she can keep an eye on the situation. All BT are prepared to do is overcharge her and take money off her for calls she hasn't made.

Connor said BT can't block the 123 number either and he could only suggest changing my aunt's phone number.  Considering my aunt's had the same telephone number for years, she of course doesnt want to do this and doesn't see why she should have too. BT expect my aunt to go to the effort of changing her number yet they wont investigate these calls themselves.

Connor also said that the 123 number has nothing to do with BT but it's a BT speaking clock! I'm confused how he can claim they have nothing to do with the BT speaking clock?

What makes me laugh is that this was the loyalty team I was speaking too and they have proven they don't reward loyalty at all. My aunt has been with BT for years and this is how they treat her.

I also came across a 'Which' article that talks about other people getting charged for 123 calls they hadn't made so this isn't an isolated incident."

112396,"First phone I received was faulty with a screen glitch and requested a second phone. That again was faulty, this time with a usbC issue and a faulty speaker. As I also use my phone for work it is crucial it functions and I have wasted hours of my time. I will not be using envirophone again, and will be getting a secondhand phone from elsewhere."
150487,"Attempting to cancel the maintenance on a phone system we no longer use at our business is essentially impossible. So now we're just going to not pay any more bills that arrive and see what happens. No doubt they'll pass the debt onto debt collectors and we'll explain the situation with them.

Long story short, I contacted customer services who directed me to an online 'cancel maintenance' form I needed to complete - which I did. However, one question asks if you've read the terms and conditions, and if you select no, it will not allow you to submit the form. But clicking the link to the terms and conditions doesn't work. It just times out. So I just selected yes and made it clear to the customer service rep that it wasn't working so I had no way of reading them. They never replied and even though the form says they'll be in touch within 7 working days, I've never heard anything from them. This was three months ago and today I've received another bill. The customer service rep never responded to me either.

I could go on about other negative experiences with BT going back to when we first signed up with them in 2016 (e.g. taking over two years to finally get a refund of almost £1000 we were owed), but I think I'd rather stick toothpicks under my finger nails then dredge up the countless anxiety-inducing pastimes I've had with this infuriating company."

133210,"Incompetent from start to finish. Just after booking Virgin to install full fibre I had two friends tell me to cancel as they are awful. I kept my booking as I was hopeful, I wish I hadn't. Raising a complaint with them makes no difference it's just more of your time wasted. I have now cancelled the install and gone to Vodafone.

16/11/22 - Order placed and install date of 10th december booked.
16/11/22 - Operatives from Virgin came to the property to ""do external works"" no external works were done and the operative told my wife we would be better off with BT openreach.
25//11/22 - While no one was home, operatives came to my property, dug up part of the front garden, took pictures, spoke to my neighbour then left (I have CCTV footage).
10/12/22 - Operatives arrived to complete the installation but said they couldn't as pre-construction hadn't been done. Told me someone would be back later that day but nobody came.
11/12/22 - I filed a complaint to Virgin.
12/12/22 - Virgin confirms works rebooked for 30/12/22
21/12/22 - Not happy with the response from Virgin, I asked for confirmation of when pre-construction works would be completed.
22/12/22 - Virgin ""apologise"" and confirm technician booked for 30/12/22
30/12/22 - Once again the technician arrived to complete the install but again said he couldn't as the pre-construction team hadn't done anything.
30/12/22 - I complained to Virgin AGAIN and was told the connection is not scheduled until Late feb now! I said this wasn't good enough and the call handler agreed. The call handler said he would speak to the local team on 3rd Jan and call me back on 4th Jan.
04/01/22 - I received an automated phone call from Virgin saying they had tried to call me. I had received no other calls from Virgin prior to that.
06/01/22 - Virgin called me to confirm my install in Feb. I again said this wasn't good enough and asked to speak to the complaints team. The complaints team again agreed and passed me back to the construction team to get an earlier date. After explaining the issue to the construction call handler she said she needed my account number, I asked her to wait while I got it then she disconnected the call."
154892,Great staff. Very helpful. Great products too.
177608,"Wanted some seperates but 1 not in stock at the Southampton branch according to the website.
Gave them a ring and had a good discussion with Ben who checked and it was it stock and put them to one side.

Wanted to pay by card but whe ringing its a bank transfer thats sent, a note for next time. However, I could get to the shop by leaving work a little earlier and paid by card in full.

Arranged to collect them the following week which was today.

All staff were polite, courteous and helpful. As I was collecting Rob brought 1 box to the car which was a short walk away.

Nothing but praise for all at the branch."
117484,"If I could give zero I would, customer service is useless. Tried to upgrade as out of data supposedly which is dubious as only ever used a fraction of what three claim I have used with previous providers and despite paying an upgrade fee data is still off. Contacted customer service who offered me extras and the required data within 24 hours and nothing has changed. I had bad experiences with Three years ago but thought id give them another chance. Why did I ever think Three had improved, big mistake!"

108972,"Be very careful when you request a 'Sports Day' package to watch a single event. The process is very obscure and somehow I ended up with 'Entertainment', 'Cinema' and 'Boost' packages I didn't want or ask for. Only when I checked my bank statement did I see that I was being charged monthly for these services. To try to get it resolved I realised that you can't speak to someone, you have to work through the website. Really disappointed to see this kind of stealthy, sharp practice from a Sky brand!"

155448,"I purchased a fridge freezer from this company, it’s arrived and is damaged I got a call from
Customer services and the women was very rude offering a 40 pound discount for the amount of damage so I said not willing for that. The front door at the bottom has a big dent in it so not like it’s the side we’re you can hide it. The women was rude and just put the phone down, I will never order from this company again and I will be contacting someone higher with this. Shame on your customer services I’ll be sticking with AO from now on
I’ve still no idea if there coming for the fridge freezer or not, my advice is order else we’re unless you can tolerate rude people."

163667,"Quality and presentation of the photos (prints and enlargements) was excellent. No complaints. Delivery, ie timing delays, left something to be desired (and GPO not supposed to be striking at the time)."
138103,Quick Mobile Fix were as quick as their name in sending out excellent quality refurbished iphones. Highly recommended.
153051,"Purchased a ninja air fryer damaged. Returned for refund, called after 14days for refund. They have not even acknowledged the product was returned forget about refund. Used Web chat and I was told to wait 24-48 hrs. And I should get refund confirmation. Web chat again after three days, now they are telling me to wait another 48-72 hrs. Jokers. They have failed to their own policy."

183927,"Bought the mini paddle
Brush which is great for shorter hair"
195255,The worst ever ever service. Mis-sold product . None of numerous complaints answered or addressed in any way. When contract ended was offered a much more expensive product and when I tried to cancel the service it was impossible. Customers are just a number. BT are so big they don’t care about customers or service standards. Shocking.
169978,The engineer who upgraded my system was excellent boosting my signal as well as exchanging both TiVo boxes.
105966,Half the price of some other sites and was here within a couple of days. Very happy. Would defo recommend

134289,"The web order was doubled up ,rang to inform FFX and told it would be cancelled, next day email informing me I was getting the second of the double order, phoned again,told someone will ring you back,they didn't, eventually got a courrier to collect and send back, it's taken nearly 3 weeks and still waiting for refund !!Great when everything is right but when there's a problem poor customer service¡!!!!!"
161150,"Good at quick payment, but they reject too many good condition books. I check every one before boxing up, so not sure why they get rejected. I sent in a box, value of over £13, and got under £5 when finished. If I knew this before sending I would have used a rival company. I won't be using them again. I think musicmagpie need to change their policy and return rejected items, we their customers and suppliers need to be treated fairer. Every time they reject a good condition item, we lose money, which is what we are using them to obtain. Stop these companies stealing our items and pay us or return them. We are trying to get these items to their next person to enjoy and it is going to a recycling centre instead."
178077,"I’ve just switched to Shell for my broadband and unfortunately my router has not arrived due to the postal strikes. I contacted the team to see if there was anything they could do to help get me online ASAP. They were very helpful in alleviating my concerns and were able to provide very detailed guidance which allowed me to connect up my new connection via my old router. They also profusely apologised for the delay in delivering the hub, even though it wasn’t there fault. I hope this level of service is what I continue to experience for the duration of my contract."
169885,"We rang to express our displeasement with our appliance and were first told that we were over the 100 days return policy. When we asked for the exact amount of days since purchase, we were at 103 days. So, we wanted to contest this extra 3 days. That's when they rectified the 100 days return policy to be 100 days without any uses. We were constantly being told that all they could do was to refer us back to the manufacturer. So, a big £500 down the drain and we are stuck with a tumble dryer that dries as good as hanging your washing out in the rain."

155424,"DISHONEST. Complete waste of time. After waiting a week to receive my order, they took it upon themselves to cancel it. No valid reason given.

Update: 24 hours after contacting them (as per their auto-response below) - heard nothing.

Update: still no response, however, in fairness to them I have now received the refund."

Disappointed in the battery not liking the cold, I have put the bracket for the vac just inside the integral garage door out of the way and due to the weather the garage is cold and the battery won’t work for 10mins or so.
So i have to keep unclipping the battery and finding somewhere in the house to put it when not in use.
All my cordless drill’s etc work ok straight out of cold garage!!!"
189150,"Wex would always be my first choice when buying equipment as new is brand new.. Their demonstation models are purely for that purpose only.

Using your website I obtained 3 quotations.
The companies that arrived were all very polite and proffesional and arrived exactly at the time they promised.

A very helpful way to get the right people to contact for quotes."
194857,"The help given in making a choice of which product to buy was helpful and without any feeling of being under pressure to make a particular choice.
The actual purchasing process was handled in an efficient and friendly manner.
The only reason for not allocating five stars is that Currys now seem to be using a rather convoluted method of collecting a product that is not ""in stock"" on the day. (In fact, I am not sure how it would work for someone without a mobile phone!)"
114693,Easy to put together and very easy to use
131858,Hi I appreciate your price and your products are none commun. Your site is friendly user.

And so when I saw the price had gone up and was no longer pending with my bank, decided to purchase through amazon. They arrived next day. 2 weeks later I received the ones from ghd (no free spray included!!!) but when I checked still no money had been taken. It wasn't till I'd had them over a week unopened waiting to get to return them that I was then left overdrawn with my bank and with couriers fee to find as they have to be returned at my expense!!!
If this review was on the product or amazon, I'd give 5 stars as the ones I purchased from Amazon are perfect, But it's not!!!"
176669,"I usually loathe electronic stores and will do everything I can to avoid sales people with pressuring tactics as much as I can help it. I really thought it would be the same at Wex but I was happy to be proved wrong. Staff here have consistently provided me with honest guidance and advice as I have grown as a photographer. Photography can be an intimidating thing to pursue that can cause you to expect a lot 'gatekeeping' from other photographers especially if you're a woman. In Wex I've never once been made to feel judged or silly, for asking questions. Happy to be a customer for life"
186863,"Fab service as always, delivered on time and i was kept informed all the way through the delivery process with emails and a phone call on the day. Cheaper than currys as well for the same item, so win/win!!"

196540,"Order for Full Fibre Upgrade made on 12 OCTOBER 2020. It’s now Christmas Eve, Messed about at every single turn. THREE TIMES the ‘attending’ engineer said they were ‘unable to gain access’ - WHAT A JOKE - PROVEN with RECORDING CCTV - NEVER Attended. Lying Dishonesty. Gross Negligence and Mind-blowing Incompetence. Totally Unprofessional. I even took a Leave Day off work - again to be told (after waiting TEN HOURS looking out the window!) = ‘no one in, unable to gain access’!!! Then I sit TWO DAYS IN A ROW, with the phone in my hand, only to be told ‘uncontactable’ and ‘complaint case closed’!!! Cynical. Apathetic. Disinterested. Disingenuous. Dishonest. I know you just don’t care BT - it’s only a 2 year, £1000+ contract, but ORDER CANCELLED. I will NEVER waste my precious Time and Money, pandering to your utter lying incompetence, Ever Again. I’ll happily take my hard earned cash elsewhere (and get a much better service/contract/cost, anyway!) It could not possibly be ANY WORSE! Merry Christmas. Foolishly Cynical BT."
107822,"OK, I know the consensus on big organisations like BT are that they are atrocious at looking after their customers, but I have to honestly say, this is not the case in my experience. Firstly, I have been with BT since January this year (2021) and have had nothing but superb customer service, prompt delivery of Wi-Fi related items and nothing but a perfect Wi-Fi signal from the minute we switched on the Router. All I can say is that I am more than happy with the customer service that I have received from BT and would most definitely recommend them over and above the likes of Virgin Media (whose customer service I have experienced first hand). Thank you BT from one totally satisfied customer."
113814,"Bought a phone online, I got it turned it on and it was slow straight out the box so I went to a store to return an baring in mind the phone is still in original packaging with front screen seal still on and in perfect condition got told because I turned it on I can't return it and there's nothing to be done about it. How is that fair? Gave me a number to ring which I did and it would ring a few times then just end call, finally got through on a live chat and they picked it up same day an refunded. So why couldn't that be done in store?"
103177,"No quibble on price, money in bank in couple of days, would recommend and use again in the future"

146298,"Vodafone broadband pro. 900Mbps.

I have never had such terrible service from advisers or such a poor wifi product.

Initial set up delays, two separate broadband kits and two dates, months apart, despite booking to have the service a month in advance. Had to extend sky to cover the period.

Initial issues with speed never as high a claimed. Hours on app and chat to resolve. Wanted a log of speeds at many times each day otherwise it could not be put forward for further investigation.

Terrible WiFi signal and random device drop out within the house.

Boosters which don't connect properly.

Hours again wasted in queues for chats or on chats. No way for them to call you back when the chats drop out either. No way to speak to management.

Advice that conflicting sky q product is not compatible with Vodafone mesh, and that the sky q signal takes 24 hours to disappear after it has been unplugged from the wall.

Do not get Vodafone broadband. If I could get out the contract early I would.

**** Update.... service levels continue to be of same standard. Reply on my review, asking for more time to be wasted in online chat. Where is the real customer interaction to cure dissatisfaction?! ****"
195422,Excellent price & service. Delivered next day.

Thanks Romaine!
Ebuyer- It would be great to have a choice of delivery company!
I would normally choose a supplier based upon this."
196104,"We find that Three's data connections are practically unusable in our area, and always have been. After many years, it's unlikely that Three will ever improve.

For £35 a month (""unlimited data"") on Three PAYG, we feel we are getting ripped off. Three is continually slowing down our internet, and confirms this on its website.

Three UK is not delivering satisfactory service for the price. We tried other UK networks and they were all faster and better than Three UK.

For example, 20 minutes to upload over the internet on a Three sim, compared to just three minutes on most other networks.

Three can claim all they like that they are upgrading their network, but they still run TrafficSense which they admit slows down internet speeds.



The Three network is bad in our area of North Devon. The signal may have improved but uploads/downloads speeds are constantly ridiculous.

On its website, Three UK states it uses TrafficSense, which means throttling connections and that activities and tethering are slowed down."
155059,Great fast delivery and with a surprise of a couple of free pens inside made this delivery extra special

Updated 22nd Jan.
So today I received the refund after giving my bank details for a second time.
Only after giving a negative review did buyspares contact me and resolve the issue.
I have updated the amount of stars and would of been entirely happy had this not have taken so long.

But just had a call saying my order has been cancelled as they seem to think I have another provider which is absolutely false,
Spent pretty much the while of the two weeks trying to arrange this reconnection and still not got anywhere no one can tell me how my broadband came to be disconnected in error just that apparently it happens sometimes is the only explanation I got.
I will be cancelling any further dealings with Vodafone as this as just proved to me that no one there seems to know what's going on.
I will be getting a new broadband provider from now on and never will I use Vodafone again.
Absolutely useless"

Was sent an ‘Acknowledgment’ email when order was placed, but no dispatch email. Have tried at least once every day to contact their customer services via the ‘bot’, WhatsApp, email and phone but had no response.

Terrible customer service and company approach to dealing with customers. I would recommend going to one of their distributors rather than through GHD."
124152,"I am writing to complain about the extraordinarily poor service we have received.
1.The shop assistant was excellent able to answer all our questions and reassure us about the product, because she was so competent she encouraged us to trust the company to deliver, remove doors if necessary ,set the fridge freezer up both physically and electronically and to buy into the complete package of after care. We left very happy people especially as the item would be arriving within two days of purchase.
2. We were informed of the approximate time of delivery , and it was on time. The delivery men were cordial and polite the doors did not need removing.
3 however they looked at the current fridge and said they could not fit our new one as they were not trained to set up and install hard wired fridges nor to deal with the electronics .
4. They found a date when the professional fitters were next available 6th December the new machine was delivered and abandoned on the 24th November.
5. They left the American fridge freezer in the middle of my kitchen partially blocking a door and making the table inaccessible . It is enormous which in situ is not a problem but where it is is ridiculous .
6 I phoned customer service to ask to have the date moved forward. I spoke to Ashford. While he was charming and concerned he could only offer me the same date. Alternative I could arrange my own fitting, but he guessed that that might effect my insurance in the future should the fridge go wrong , I therefore did not pursue this line.
I asked to talk with his manager he was not available. When pushed Ashford went and spoke to the manager who said that Ashford should try to advance the fitting .
Ashford said he would send an email and if he could do something he would ring me back!!! I said no that was not appropriate I wanted to hear from him either way .
I HAVE NOT HAD THE PROMISED PHONE CALL .
Is this the high handed way you treat your customers?
Basically the attitude was we have your money and we really don't care now.
My home is basically impossible to live in , I have two massive fridge freezers and I am expected to put up with this its a major inconvenience and extremely upsetting .
We are not at all happy and feel that the service you provided is nothing like the one described by two of your staff and by the written information we were given.
I am sending this as i have still not heard from Team KH"
110474,The owner comes across as very honest and trustworthy. Quality advice.

137779,"I purchased Motorola g7 from your store at airport retail park Coventry on 23 November 2019. The phone is less than 2 months old and has developed a fault with the speaker. I went into the store to ask them to replace or repair the device which they said I had to speak to Motorola. They stated that they don't like selling Motorola phones, If Motorola are not fit for purpose why do you sell them? ( I've got lots of friends and family who have being using Motorola for the last 6 years without an issue). After searching on the internet I would like to remind carphone Warehouse of there obligations ""the Consumer Rights Act (which replaced the Sale of Goods Act from October 2015) any product you buy must be as described, of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose. So if your phone develops a fault, you could be entitled to a full refund, repair or replacement. Your options depend on what’s happened and how old the mobile handset was when it developed the fault. If the fault develops within six months, the law assumes that the fault was inherent in the phone unless the retailer can actually prove otherwise."" I would like to understand how carphone are complying with these obligations."

135593,"Your salesman, Joe, in your Leeds shop, was very knowledgable and helpful when I came into store looking for a Turntable, Amp and Speakers. Although you didn't have the Amp and Speakers in stock, Joe arranged free delivery if the items. The items arrived on the date he said. The only issue was that Joe had arranged for the Speaker Leads to be delivered as well but DPD somehow managed to put the Lead on a different van, meaning I didn't receive it until the following day (not your fault). I've set up the system and it plays really well. Thanks yo all uour staff in Leeds their product knowledge and Customer Service Skills are a credit to your Company. Thanks again."
185939,"The people at Richer Sounds in the branch I have visited several times, Romford, are right on it. They are customer focussed, and know their stuff right away. I had a delivery that came the very next day after my query, and they had taken the extra mile step of getting on the courier that day, instead of the next. They want happy customers first and foremost, and it shows."
191867,"I was returning a TV as it was for my CCTV system, unfortunately it goes off every few hours and there is no way of preventing this. After handing it over the woman in argos Wishaw, (Karen) said it had pet hair on it. So i asked where and she said you would need to take it home and clean it. I took it to my car and seen no obvious hairs exept a very small one, i cleaned TV and returned to store a man then took tv plugged it in etc and said that's fine where is your card ending in ????. I could not find any card with the expiry date or no. so left the store and put the tv in my boot. I returned home after checking my bank balance i realised it was Google Pay and they made up random numbers for card. I then returned and Karen said i am not returning this it has pet hair, she made me clean it and then side of it then said i was to clean the box and take the polystyrene out and clean behind it

Then she said i was to clean the remote (i can honestly say this was not a dirty tv full of hair i couldnt even see them , she said how would you feel if you had pet allergies and received this?? When the man who accepted the return was testing it he had fingermarks on the screen (i had never touched tv since) and she made me clean his finger marks(covid risk for me i think) then she noticed a tiny screw missing which i had dropped, made me clean it all again and stared at every single angle at this point i was even more humiliated, she then after all this refused to return it as the top polystyrene was missing. If she was going to refuse it due to this why didn't she say this at beginning rather than having me clean it down knowing she wasn't going to accept it?

I drove 15 miles into Glasgow Fort who refunded me straight away no questions.

In Wishaw I asked her name she said Karen, I asked her to write it down, I also asked her second name and she refused under data protection.
My question then was how many Karens are there in store she said just her. I asked the complaints procedure, and she said Argos customer service.

I spend a lot of money in Argos both for my business and family and also have argos card. I will be very reluctant to return to Argos Wishaw if Karen was still there. She was very rude, and on a power trip you really felt she was enjoying the experience.
If one of my staff treated my customers that way I would be ashamed of myself and of my staff.

The detail of me having to come home with fraud department in mind thinking how did a different card number show on my receipt, how did Argos staff not figure this out? Surely people use google pay every day?
How many people are treated like this by Karen? if that is even her real name."

154553,"The product is great, the issue I have is that the payment came out 9 days after the product arrived."
118865,"So sent my phone for trade in and carphone warehouse receved it on the 2nd of Oct as I can see someone has signed for it. a week later I emailed them to see what was happening as I had received no email or anything and got no reply back ,i called on the 12th and got told they had sent an email and I would hear back in 48hrs, I heard nothing back I then called back again to get told its 72hrs I should wait I then waited and heard noting back about my phone so I then had to call back again to get told that the warehouse is looking into this and trying to see if they received my phone that they received 2 weeks ago and the women on the phone told me she cannot put me through to a manager and I cannot call the trade in people only email them in which I done over a week ago and still no reply so I said to the women it sounds like they lost my phone in which she didn't deny im now at the point where I am waiting another 48hrs and if I do not hear nothing back again I will have to take it to the police as I actually don't no what to do anymore and no one wants to help me never in my life have I dealt with such an unhelpful company and I'm absolutely shocked at how carphone warehouse treat there customers"
123058,"Excellent staff ,could not do enough for me - Well done to they staff at Herne Bay"
130272,The member of staff was excellent at explaining how the whole process and paperwork would go and he made the process painless.
109951,"Bought some Christmas tree decorations for presents for family, which didn't arrive before Christmas. At the time of ordering, it said they would arrive before 23rd. Customer service was useless. Requested a refund because the product arrived way after it was supposed to arrive, but my request was ignored. You can also barely see the picture on the acrylic it's so dark. Pointless waste of money. Won't be using Snapfish again."
163632,Did a click and collect and was charged twice. Still trying to get it sorted customer service is no good.
109794,"I’ve been a customer for years, the usual, excellent courteous service from Paul, highly recommended 😎🎶🎶🎶"
154903,"Excellent communication problems solved straight away, kept up to speed with delivery would highly recommend"
128907,"Shocking amount of pushy sales tactics. I thought there were laws about a hard sell.
I was wrongly charged for an early upgrade which at this moment I’m not sure I’ll get back.
Also be aware you have to haggle just to get an offer that’s clearly on their own website."
127348,Very helpful in explaining and guiding options
152793,Very smooth transaction and next day delivery was perfect
120818,Wait for almost one mounts for my new subscription ( Fab Fabre ). I do not recommend at all
118313,"Fast, efficient, reliable. Thank you! Very pleased customer. 😊"
121954,I ordered straighteners over two weeks ago and have not heard a thing. Have emailed the company twice and have received no reply. Are other people experiencing the same lack of customer service and products not being sent to them? Not sure how to get my delivery made or my money back if they do not even reply to their customer emails.
149762,The website was very easy to use and the cards turned out just as expected. Would recommend!
145218,I was very pleased to find the part I needed for my Dyson as Dyson themselves didn't have it in stock.Or anywhere else ! It more expensive than Dyson but as I needed it I had to pay
142019,Really good service. Shipped quicker than expected and arranged hassle-free returns when I no longer needed the product.
182206,"This is a super helpful app for anyone who is an ambassador! And it’s fun to do, easy to navigate, and I am having a blast with it! Definitely recommend!"
128866,"Delighted with the Thank You cards I ordered. Website is easy to use and my order arrived swiftly after purchasing. Also, a massive selection of cards to choose from which was great!"

197467,"Now always do click and collect when buying from eBay, I know I will receive items from argos,had items gone astray from the post room in my block of flats."
148221,"This review will be quite long, unfortunately due to the terrible experience I had with BT.
I first contacted BT in early January 2022 to order a broadband package. We had recently exchanged on a property and I wanted to ensure the WI-FI was up and running for when we moved in. I ordered the package online and selected a date for my installation which was Jan 28th. The package was on offer at £24.99 per month. I had an email to confirm my order and all was well. The actual Wi-Fi modem arrived in the post a couple weeks later. I booked off the 28th Jan from work and waited at the property for my engineer to install the Wi-Fi. I noticed no one had showed up so I rang BT and they told me no one would be coming as there was an error with open reach. I was told I would be updated 2 day later. 3 days passed and I heard nothing so I rang up again and I was again told to wait 2 more days for an update. 2 days later I received a phone call from BT and I was told there was a delay somewhere with the order process and that I would again be updated ASAP. To make matters worse the employee started to try and sell me a new phone SIM card with EE!! At this point I was really losing my patience as we were still without Wi-Fi. One week then passed so I rang up BT and expressed my anger. A female employee explained that there had been a glitch somewhere and she apologised and said it would be best to cancel the whole order and order again from fresh. I agreed to this but expressed my anger. She stated she would transfer me to the sales department and would explain the situation to the sales rep. I was transferred and no surprise the guy on the sales team had no idea about what had been going on with my order. I went through the new order with him and he stated that as the sale had ended I would now have to pay £27.99 per month. I expressed that was not fair but he stated there was nothing he could do. He then told me they would send a new Wi-Fi box out in the post. I explained there was no need as I already had one. He told me that they had to send a new one and he recommended when the new one arrived I simply sent it straight back!! What a waste of time and money that is! He then asked me my availability for installation with an engineer. I explained I had already been waiting nearly a month and needed it ASAP. He told me the earliest was 3rd March!! I went with this date even though deep down I knew I wanted earlier.
A day passed and I reflected back on my experience with BT and thought to myself why should I even be giving them business based on how they have treated me. I looked at TALKTALK and could see they could offer me faster speeds, cheaper monthly cost and most importantly a earlier installation date. I ordered with them. I rang BT and told them I wanted to cancel my order and told them the reasons why! The employee of the phone didn’t believe me when I said TALKTALK could give me an earlier date which I found extremely rude and arrogant. He told me the order was cancelled. A week later I received an email from BT to say my order was in in the way. I rang them up and questioned this sand told them I cancelled so why have I got an order coming. The employee told me that there had been a glitch cancelling my order so he would do it again for me. After 15 minutes on the phone he told me it was cancelled. But no. Again 2 days later I received a further email to confirm my installation visit from the engineer. I also received a parcel in the post which another BT Wi-Fi package inside!! I rang the AGAIN. At this point I really was loosing my temper. I was told that my order was not cancelled! The woman on the phone said she would cancel it now for me. And since then I’ve heard no more!
To make it worse, I received an email from BT around 3 days ago to say if you don’t send back your kit you will receive a £100 fee. I now had to send back all this kit and pay for the postage myself!!!

I am actually shocked and disgusted by this service and can safely say I will NEVER even consider going with BT in the future. On a lighter note my Wi-Fi with TALKTALK is up and running with no hassle!!"
183121,"Never showed up to install broadband, when we rang up they said engineer had been and installed it outside but there was still no service and they had took the money. A week later they've still not sorted anything and have wasted 3 days waiting for an engineer to show up whom never does! Customer service is appalling, they cut you off when they don't know what to do and can't be bothered to deal with your problem. Will be cancelling and getting money back for a service I never received."
159275,"Easy ordering, great value, fast delivery"
111695,Always a pleasure doing business with WEX
100942,Absolute joke of a company. Ask you to call so that they can lie about conversations that took place. Make sure you have everything in writing and record the conversations. Took lots of money from my account saying I was out of contract when their person on the phone told me that I would get a credit and be put on a lower monthly contract and I would get a phone call. Non of the three promised things happened. Now they want to 'talk talk' to me about my complaint! Why? So they can deny all knowledge again. Absolute wasters!
195501,"The order was delivered incomplete. It was meant to come with an oval dressing brush which never arrived. I contacted ghd but they didn’t even bother responding.
Can’t comment on product as it was bought as a gift but customer service is terrible. It is meant to be a premium product and it was not cheap but customer service is certainly not a premier service."
110462,"DO NOT use this company they advertise refurb phones they do not have, hide behind emails and do not follow their terms and conditions.
I order 2 refurb phones 11/05/2020, money £489.96 taken immediately I had no further emails confirming shipment of phones. I sent several emails they used Convid19 as their excuse. 02 June I emailed again advising I would go to Resolvers, they cancelled my order I am still chasing the refund that should have been received within 7-10 days. This company is dishonest and will not provide a contact number."
100886,"DON'T BUY FROM CURRY'S

LITERALLY the most incompetent and genuinely stupid people I've ever had to deal with. I've had to contact them 7 or 8 times over the last 2+ months, only to be lied to time and time again. Horrible and generally useless customer service. Buy your electronics from Argos or Amazon, or anywhere else really but here."
126477,"I ordered a dehumidifier on Friday evening and it has arrived on Saturday morning. I can't has for more.
The only problem was that item has arrived with a small black mark on the front.
But it was great the speed."
194337,"Was easy to located type of memory needed, arrived promptly and worked when installed."
102233,"One correct item sent, one incorrect item sent. Then very difficult to make this error known to the Company."
191754,"Very efficient, with fast delivery and easy to follow online instructions. Only reason I gave a 4 star rather than a 5 was a couple of instructions were not given until after the order was made. One in particular could have deterred me from using this company eg old machine for recycling needed to be put outside of house. For a elderly or vulnerable person this would have been impossible."
168401,Helpful and pleasant delivery staff. Fast delivery.
129314,We have a holiday cottage and were moved to Shell from Pure Planet when they went bust. We have supplied Shell with regular meter readings (for electricity only) since November last year (2021). Despite this Shell have used estimated readings and insist we pay a monthly direct debit of £250. This is despite the cottage only being used for a couple of months this year. We have been overcharged by at least a £1000. I have now sent Shell over 30 emails trying to resolve this. I have called them and used their chat function. Despite this they have done nothing. Rather they keep prompting me in the app to increase my monthly payments. It is absolutely unbelievable and I am at the end of my tether. I am now forced to try and seek redress / help via The Energy Ombudsman and am writing to the national papers. At a time of a major cost of living crisis their behaviour is shocking - particularly when you consider their massive windfall profits. Overcharging their customers and wilfully ignoring their pleas for help / resolution as a way to extract as much profit as they are able. Apalling.
174760,Never had any problems with talk talk in the three years I’ve been with them.
149319,Excellent service. Store Manager went above and beyond to ensure we had new phones for Christmas.
180884,"Ordered food , driver did not knock on our door , cctv to prove ! Received notification saying they’d tried to deliver and waited 8mins - lie ! Rang deliveroo and they said there is nothing they can/will do . Absolute joke or a company . £54 down the drain . App now deleted"
199387,"I have had no washer since 17/12/22 and that’s almost 6 weeks now, waited weeks for a repair date booked a holiday yesterday as you should have been coming today to fix 25/01/23 and got a message yesterday afternoon to say it couldn’t actually be repaired so I need to pick a new one! Then to top it off delivery is now next week 1/02/23 so there’s another week to wait and another days holiday I have to arrange in order to wait for delivery :("
123686,"Really easy and quick process, to sending away my phone and my money being deposited in my bank.

Definitely use this company again"
106582,I ordered a washing machine over the phone yesterday said free delivery today and a 2 hour slot would be sent it was then would be updated 30 minutes before actual delivery they did brought it very carefully and respected the property and contents very friendly and chatty put it where we wanted and left can’t fault the service full marks will definitely use again in the future many thanks
146699,"Awful, awful, awful!
I would give no stars if I could!
Doesn't even have access to YouTube or Disney plus and customer service is non-existent 🤦 when I said I'm not happy with something they told me ""It is what it is"" and didn't even try to resolve it!
Can't wait for my term to end and go back to sky... Don't waste your money and stay clear please... TV and broadband with BT is a waste of your money!!!"
185866,You phone up to speak to a manager to be told there is no manager and one will call back in 24 hrs and they never do
194692,"Review is not about the TV it's poor because of delivery.

Gave us a window of delivery between 1630 and 1930. Turned up on the doorstep of mother in law's at 8 am. Literally she had to get out of bed to take delivery. Not happy"
138750,"Good machine, light, and easy to manoeuvre. Bought a set with small hand held one and would not have scored it as high without this as the upright does not get into the edges."
121916,"Rubbish Customer Services. You cannot get Customer Services support over the phone if you bought the phone in a store!!

You always need to go back to the store. How ironic that a company that sells phones cannot support all their customers over the phone! This will be a great example at my training courses on 'Communications' and 'Customer Services'."
142593,Love my GHD hair dryer! Delivery was quick and easy!
165227,"Quick and fast delivery. Website was easy to use, had no issues and came next day with free delivery."

153596,"Great advice, friendly staff, fantastic prices… the BEST!"
198180,The cooker hood light diffusers seem to be exactly the same as the old cracked original Rangemaster ones - but at half the price! The supplied screws a perfect match too.
192026,"Good price, excellent comms and quick delivery. Perfect!"
157095,"Switched to BT from Sky, with both broadband and tv, have been with BT for past 2 years. During that time have had various issues with service and tbh how BT have handled those issues have been poor. However on the whole the Internet has been reliable so, ok.
Contract ended, offered 'an amazing deal' to stay, so I took it, only to find the deal offered much worse than what BT offering new customers!
Contacted BT (whilst in 14 cancel period) explained situation, to be told they will sort and offer great deal etc.
I won't bore you with the details, but after weeks of me chasing, and BT constantly promising to sort and call me, they never did, not once! I have chased constantly and today, finally after yet more terrible service, and being passed pillar to post, to be told by the loyalty team they actually 'can't offer the same deal as new BT customer' I decided to cancel and terminate.
Not only because of a lack of loyalty to current customers, but also the terrible service.
If you want decent broadband, ok go with BT. The hub is most powerful and reliable WiFi.
However be warned, the service is awful. They do not care about loyalty, (or actually about keeping promises of returning calls) the monthly bills are often wrong, and so, be warned.
Have gone back to SKY, where the service was always good, only reason I left was BT could offer far better Internet, but gladly that is no longer the case!
I will not return to BT."
184082,Always have great products and I have now experienced their great customer service. Ordered two calendars and they didn’t arrive (due to postal disruptions) I contacted Snap fish and they dispatched again and I received beautiful calendars two days later. Would definitely recommend Snapfish.
117008,"I have been with studio for years now & have never had any complaints as their delivery drivers are polite, their call centre staff are very helpful & their products are fantastic value for money."
186776,"All I wanted to do was cancel a downgrade of my mobile and leave things as they were. A simple task you would think until you enter the twilight zone or as by call it 'we're very busy at the moment etc etc'. If you're that busy at all hours as it seems why don't you employ more people or provide a means to do what I want on line. On the plus side the wait time wasn't wasted... the dogs got walked, the bed got made, the fire got cleaned.."
162684,Bought SSD drive from these guys for 65 just over a year hardly used it decided to trade back in which ok indicated 33 cash went into the shop girl was very rude and said 25 i said you haven't got right model number she investigating further i said i had bought off you guys online she checked my account and said oh yes then said comeback in 10 minutes to do check i came back we can't take it it's faulty i argued i had bought of it off them it was working bought came up with a weird excuse about it being damaged from port etc don't buy anything from these guys it's worse than refurbished.

All works brilliant

Was keep up to date on delivery time and emailed invoice which was brilliant
Would recommend"
145198,"Had a lot of trouble when switching package.
Open reach engineer decided to disconnected my ISDN line in the nearest junction box.
Hence the terrible slow speeds and problems with the Home Phone line.
Eventually after many contacts with BT staff the Issues where sorted.
Just a shame it took so long.
Happy now."
143897,"I ordered online, for store collection, all seemed well. Within 48hrs the parcel was ready to collect, so I went to store and picked it up
The product box was inside a cardboard shipping box and having checked my address and order number on the sticker, I didn't notice any problem. Once home I opened the shipping box, only to find it was completely the wrong product!
I was back in the store within 20 mins of picking it up, but to my horror the assistant said they couldn't take it back, as DPD wouldn't collect from their store?!!! They said I had to take it home (they sent the wrong item!!) and arrange for it to be collected - this means staying in, which is why I went for store delivery in the first place, to avoid wasting time waiting in for deliveries. In addition, they had the item I ordered in stock at the store and they also stocked the item that they had sent - but they couldn't give me the one on the shelf and take the incorrect item into their stock - how hard can that be? and so much better for the environment too!
The assistant was helpful and offered to ring up and arrange the collection for me, while I was in store. She did this and said DPD would be in contact with a collection date within 48 hours and the correct article deliver a couple of days after this. So I carried ""their"" product back to ""my car/house"".
Well, a week passed and nothing at all happening, so off I go back to the store. Same conversation, different assistant, again helpful and she calls again. Same answer, 48 hours and 2 days etc. She could see that this had already been done once, but could not explain why this didn't work.
This time, not within 48 hours, but within 72, I got a collection date through and the product was collected.
Several days later I had a message saying they had received my return and a replacement would be sent soon - it wasn't a return and I didn't want a replacement - it was the wrong item and I wanted what I'd ordered, there is a difference.
It gets worse, 3 days later I received an email from Currys saying ""we've lost your product"" They were sorry but they had lost my delivery and cannot find it, they will be sending a replacement as soon as possible.
By this time, I wasn't surprised at all.
Eventually, I got a text to say my product was ready for collection, so yet another trip to the store (the 4th!). This time it was correct and thankfully I have the right product.
I ordered (and paid for) the product on 12th December, as I wanted it for Christmas. I finally got the correct one, after 4 trips to store, on 3rd January 2023 - over 3 weeks later.
No apology, no gesture, that's obviously what they consider normal/acceptable.
I would strongly caution against ordering for store collection, as it's basically the same as getting it delivered to a neighbour, only further to drive to get it!"
168350,"Well done again Studio, great bargains and service."
170294,"I bought a JVC Android TV back in February (and I'd recommend that anyone reading this steers clear of them); it's had multiple faults with freezing & unresponsive menus (basically you can't use much of the smart functionality).
Sent it for repair twice, each time the problem persisted.
Phoned customer services to see what to do as they were unable to fix the problem, and was advised by an agent to use my right to reject goods. TV was picked up on the 12th July (repair reference 716762), and I've had nothing back since then! When I've phoned to chase, Team Knowhow tell me it's a customer services issue, customer services tell me they are waiting from an update from repair (team Knowhow).

I've owned the TV for 6 months, and Currys have had it for more than 6 weeks of that time. Absolutely shocking customer service!"
160408,Great value for money Quick delivery too.
136902,"I ordered and paid for a phone from Quick Mobile Fix in Feb 2021, as they did not have the phone I cancelled the order. The company agreed, in an email of 17th Feb 2021, to refund me my money. No money was forthcoming from the company. As I had paid by credit card my card company eventually refunded me my money on 21st July 2021. Quick Mobile Fix is a dishonest and disreputable company. All very time consuming."
137687,"I have changed this review as Tracey from Ebuyer sorted everything for me in a very efficient way, Ebuyer should give her a pay rise as she must be busy because of YODEL, If Ebuyer insist on using inappropriate delivery companies like Yodel to deliver then they are going to get a lot more negative reviews from many more customers."
178991,"I used to give 5 stars for this company as the Items, Prices and Experience were the best out there, however for the past two expensive used items I have bought this year, they have been much more than their competitors London Camera Exchange.So far I have spent more than 3000 pounds with them instead of Wex. In these times of hardship, luxury Items like photography have ment that a lot more people are interested in used items and so I think that more competitive rates are needed on that department of Wex."
173645,Needed new case for my iPad mini. Nice cream/white leather. Looks good and Does the job.
188473,"They recorded a missed payment o. My credit profile whilst conducting an investigation on my bill, they never reported back to me as promised but went ahead to record a missed payment despite having been with them for decades very disappointing experience I will never encourage anyone to join.
I have tried to speak with yourselves about this with no resolution for an answer. I am now in the middle of a purchase and I have been declined because of this unfair management response to my situation"
169611,"Further to my review regarding CEX just 5 days ago in relation to an tablet we were waiting on, we can confirm that the table has arrived and packaged well, however, it doesn't power on and we cant charge it as the power supply that some brilliant CEX worker sent with will not work with that tablet!

Perhaps the tablet doesn't even work at all!!

CEX - FYI - the Tablet appears to have a some sort of micro usb-c power input! Why have we received a micro mini usb plug with the tablet?

I cannot believe that the order was placed on the 23rd of November and here we are still having to sort out issues! Not good enough CEX!"
119094,"Was (mis)sold a contract by CW for I'd mobile. Advertised in store as Huawei P30 pro, £39.99pm, 1gb data with 50gb add on. Sales assistant assured me this was 51gb per month, and I was away happy assuming I'd been sold a good deal. 1 month in my 50gb data doesnt renew. Went back to the shop. She checks the details and it's 51gb over the 24 months of the contract. She admits full responsibility for this error and manager offers me a £60 refund to purchase add ons which will provide me with 10gb per month as well as the 40gb I have left from the original data. She assures me this will renew monthly showing me which add ons to buy. Another month passes, the 10gb add on doesn't renew. I've now been lied to twice.

Boost ??? Like what on earth ? They asking you to pay for so called their HD quality when elsewhere it is bare minimum nowadays! Are you joking ??? I have Netflix , Amazon prime , Apple TV and I must say NOW TV is the worst ever streaming service I have ever seen ! Plus they don’t offer 4K feels like back in 20th century watching movies on VHS LOL , just cancelled! One more time dear user AVOID IT !!! That’s all."
161340,"Absolutely appalling customer service and behaviour from Vodafone. They make it impossible to cancel broadband service. Been trying to cancel for a few months, calling, in Vodafone store, online.

In the store they say ""they can't cancel and that you have to call"". On the phone they never answer. Online they put you in a queue with a waiting time of over an hour which then ""conveniently disconnects"".

It is a crime how they treat customers. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. I have still not been able to cancel my contract!"

I tried ringing several times and either got engaged or it rang and rang and rang. Finally got through to someone who asked me what the problem was with the tv as it appeared to be working fine. I discovered that the person who took my call to arrange the repair had only reported it as no power, not that something had actually happened before there was no power! The customer assistant said he would pass this onto the repair team. I then went out and when I came in discovered they had tried to ring me. I tried ringing them back but, again, kept getting engaged or it rang and rang. Decided to get off the phone thinking(as it was only 3pm) they had plenty of time to contact me before they close. Heard nothing. Now today, Sunday at 17.57 hours, I get a text saying they are going to redeliver it back to me tomorrow morning between 07.55am and 11.55am, which is not convenient but surprise, surprise I can't ring to rearrange as they are closed! So they are going to end up having a wasted journey! What is difficult about contacting customers to check whether someone will be in to accept delivery or at least giving you enough notice so you can ring and rearrange. They certainly don't seem to KNOW HOW to do this!!"
117989,I had no service for over 1 week. I filled form over internet for refund. But nothing come back. Call customer service 10 times. Every person I spoke come with different answer . Got to no we're. Still filling very SAD. I am under contract so there charge me for leaving. It's trap.
190630,"By far the worst Streaming service in the UK and possibly world.

Not only you need to pay movies and tv shows separately, they also charge you extra for HD quality with 5.1 sound.
Just the entertainment + HD boost comes same price as 4k netflix package with 4 users.

In addition to the ridiculous prices, the catalogue is quite small and some shows disappear before season finale is released.

But worst of all is not the price, lack f content or the ridiculous UI (which is even worse for some Samsung tvs due remote configuration).
Worst thing is, you pay all that money for a streaming service than you have crappy TV ADs everywhere! You get 3 ads before an episode, 3 ads during the shows.

Honestly just avoid it. Use vpn to watch any HBO shows might be locked behind Now Tv. Avoid at all cost"

I've always dreaded problems as they are incompetent. Great when it's up and running but totally untrustworthy when there's a fault.

199215,"Crazily quick delivery. They said 7 - 10 days, but I got the phone around 3 days later (under-promising and over-delivering worked a treat!)

Great price, great service, feels great to have the warranty.

The only thing is the battery life on the phone - but that might be my transition from android back to iPhone, which I remember battery life was always a bit naff.

I would definitely recommend quick mobile fix.

Thank you!!

Been on the phone 6 hours over 2 weeks and it’s an utterly disgrace.
AVOID IF YOU EVER WANT CUSTOMER SUPPORT"

119130,"Today 30/12/2022

I was moving house late Sep - early Oct. Trying to call early Oct to cancel the contract but not possible to connect with anyone even the live chat or calling 0345 454 1111 (Can't contact with virgin since early Oct until today, even today calling 3 times but all disconnected).

Decided to call sale team and immediately connected on 30/12/2022.

The lady was transferring me to lots of different team (Sale Team then Detention Team then Collection Team Then Movers Team). Not sure all the team's name are correct but on the phone for over 1 hour.

The guy on the collection team told me that my account was £115 and he reduced to £50. If I pay £50 to clear the balance then he will help me to close my account (He will do it, not transfer it to another team). I decided to pay to get less stresses. After I paid, he suddenly transferring me to different team which is Movers as I think then the line just disconnected. The guy on the collection team was lying to me just to get the money and leave me alone.

I tried to call back the customer service number and amazingly the line is open and straightaway I connected with Movers Team. The guy on Movers Team was helpful but cannot help me to close my account due to some system issues. He advise me to call back later when the account is back on.

I'm not sure that when I call back, they can sort it out or not but virgin customer services is truly lowest quality services ever.

Be aware when sign a contract with them as it will be really difficult to cancel. The website does not have any clear guide for you to cancel. The live chat never get connected, the customer service number almost disconnected all the time."

The paper was delivered badly re packed covered in Yodel tape, open at one end and the paper open to the elements and the whole package was damp and stained. Ebuyer need a reliable delivery company and not Yodel who are nothing but trouble in my experience. 2 working days later I'm still waiting for a refund or replacement from Ebuyer.

Ebuyer refunded me for my damaged item after 3 working days without quibble. Bizarrely and despite me having rejected delivery the once the courier delivered the rejected parcel once again the following day. With Ebuyer's blessing it was consigned to my recycling bin.

Ebuyer's prices are competitive and their service is good. The only let down is their courier Yodel who are very poor. I'm giving Ebuyer a 4 star as they need to contract a reliable delivery courier. Otherwise it would have been a 5."

We brought a washing machine a d tumble dryer from currys both Hoover about 14 month ago. The tumble dryer lasted all of 12 months but we was ok because we had a what happens if repair plan it took over 3 weeks to replace it so not the 7 days on my repair plan but at least I could change the machine from Hoover to Bosh and it works really well. Now for part 2 of my story. 3 weeks ago the Hoover washing machine broke down the padals come of the Inside of the drum . So I phoned currys no problem we will send someone to repair it 7 days later repair man come and replaced pedals next day washing machine making a strange noise called currys no problem send someone back out 7 days later o a screws was left in side the drum !!!! Next day today the pedals have fallen of again now have to wait another 7 days to be looked at 7 days for parts 7 days to say it's no good and 7 days to get a new one it's all 7 days only problem is it should only take 7 days to replace in stead of 28 days I think the moral of the story is don't have Hoover it's just cheep don't go to currys it's just cheep and poor service . Instant Replacement !!!!!!! instant repair !!!!!!! That what we was told BUT READING THE SMALL PRINT says something different will never go to currys again"
133802,I will never shop here again after a recent experience despite being a customer for a number of years. I had an issue with my phone and they didn’t show any customer loyalty for something that could have been easily resolved. No ownership was taken. Inconsistent advice and information given. Extremely disappointed by the whole experience. Cannot recommend particularly for after sales service.

Went to pay at the till and the boy scanned the item and said he wasn't allowed to sell it to me as this was an online only product. Even though it was in the store on the shelf? Seemed stupid, so anyway I said ok, I'll buy it online and then you can just give it to me. Nope that is not possible... If I buy it online I have to wait up to 3 days for their stock system to update. Seems crazy to me the product was right there and I wanted to buy it. Spoke to the manager who was trapped by corporate rules. Went and bought one from Argos instead. Will never buy anything from Currys again as they have made something so simple so difficult."

132216,"This has got to be the worst broadband supplier ever. I have spent hours trying to cancel my home broadband contract only to be past from customer service agent to customer service agent and given phone numbers to call that only lead back to the original voicemail message so I'm still no better off. As I am in my first 14 days with them I have cancelled my direct debit and taken the modem into the local vodaphone shop.
Even their phone number for complaints takes you back to the original voice mail message so they have got it sewn up so you can never get out of leaving them,,, let them take me to court.
PS I have since managed to get through to customer service and been told my contract is closed and I have taken screen shots of the full conversation just to cover my back in case Vodafone wants to take this further."
180682,"Phoned Virgin to ask about broadband prices initially spoke to a guy who asked my details, name postcode etc he said he would run a test on the line, he said “I will work in silence madam” okay I answered 21 minutes later I was saying hello hello down the phone no answer so I hung up 21 minutes of my life I won’t get back so needless to say I won’t be transferring to them and not especially after reading the reviews on here So EE you’ve still got me"
151076,"Let's start with the good news - I ordered a hoover yesterday, and it arrived on time. I've never had any problems with Argos orders and deliveries. Five out of five for that.
Now the bad news - I searched for 4 additional items to go with my hoover, all 4 (and many more that I might have taken) were out of stock. I worked in retail a long long time - and having stuff out of stock was a complete and utter No No, you can't make profit from an empty shelf. - I, and a lot of people I know are sick of ""out of stock"" when you search Argos. They lost about £200 worth of sales, and that's just me, one person.
To be blunt Argos, it's time senior management removed their finger from you know where and actually DID something about this.
Rant over !"
126243,"Quick to pickup query and reply.
Though it needed to be referred internally to a different (technical) team, the representative- Emra V - was very quick to determine what needed to be done, as well as explain in a clear professional manner what the action plan was. Emra V was a superb Ambassador for both Shell Home Energy and superb customer service"
114774,Reliable in terms of delivery BUT need email confirmations of orders and despatch. This is because sometimes items are split from the main order - would be helpful! I have mentioned this before. Great otherwise.
164653,Shockingly bad service. Rude and aggressive call handlers. 10 months left on our broadband and tv package but the router and tv box both have intermittent faults. BT refuse to replace/ repair unless we upgrade (higher price and longer contract). When we declined the upgrade the call handler became very aggressive. Stuck paying for a service that doesn't work but will not extend the contract as will be switching as soon as we can. Avoid at all costs!
105148,"Worst experience ever. I've ordered a set of Google speakers worth 150£, I've just set them up and the sound quality is horrible. Got in touch with the customer service, the agent said that as they have been used they can't be returned. How could I test the quality without trying them? Totally nonsense! Also, the agent that I spoke to was very rude, and disconnected the chat conversation while I was still replying! I'll never buy anything from Argos again."

They do not take owership to get this fixed, they simply state that I have to raise a new order, wait another 3 weeks and go through the same thing again. If you email senior people in NowTV to try and get some help they simply block your email. avoid at all costs."

186072,Still awaiting order so not a happy with the overall experience this time around
184808,Installed and then cut of by open reach within the 3rd week. Will have to wait over a month for reactivation. All very in all it took so ver two months to get the contract started. Wish we never went with them. Customer give conflicting information and Lies from open reach engineers. Told I had missed 3 appointments when none booked and during lockdown when my while household was at home. You have been warned.
124798,"Just don't use talktalk. Pick any other provider. I ordered broadband with them in November. It's now December 15th and I still have no internet. The router arrived a week later than promised. They have promised 3 appointments from an engineer to get me connected. Not a single appointment was ever attended by an engineer with no prior warning. Leaving me waiting all day and having to rebook which takes a week at least for the next one.

The customer service is god awful. Noone seems to know what's going on, if an appointment has been booked, what your prior conversations have been about. They all suggest different solutions and don't follow through on any of them.
Their online chat is frustrating and irritating when you need quick answers.

Bizarrely my order was cancelled because it was to long without a solution and I was told that I couldn't have an engineer come out until my order had progressed. Creating a Kafkaesque feedback nightmare of order cancelled due to taking to long. Engineer not coming because order was cancelled. Order cancelled because engineer couldn't come to solve my issue.

I can't even tell you if the actual product is any good because I haven't ever gotten a service.

Use literally anyone"
141553,"Eventually listening to real concerns. The Energy prices have escalated ridiculously high, blamed on world events whilst it appears Energy companies make vast profits, absolute robbery.

I fully understand I have to pay for my useage but not whilst I’m in credit. Thankyou to Mirela J. For reverting to my original DD, which is still extremely high.

DPD driver aknowleged bag was ripped open. What happend to the phone, I dont know however Carphone Warehouse concluded their so called investigation and advised me that this is a civil matter between DPD and myself and said maybe the driver or someone in DPD has made the phone disappear. Well you chose DPD as your delivery courier so somehow you should take responsibility. DPD agent on the phone told me that they had only recieved one package whereas I should have got two seperate parcels; one for the phone and one for the game console. Given what DPD told me Carphone Warehouse never sent the phone. Upon looking at my invoice that was left in the box where the PS4 was, there is NO mention of any phone device being sent out.

113436,"The worse company I have ever dealt with incompetent and the service has been far lower than what I'd expect from such a so called reputable company. My 2 year contract was up for renewal so I renewed. Staff put me onto a 2 year deal when I only wanted 1 year. Once the contract came through I noticed the error. As I was within the 20 day cooling off period I rang in to change it. I was told to ring some other company not talk talk. The number didn't connect. I rang talk talk yet again. I was then put in a 12 month contract and sent the pdf to my email. A week later I noticed my bill still had not been amended. I rang in again. I was told I needed to do the contract again for the 3rs time! By this stage I had wasted over 3 hours. Also told £30 set up connection fee?! I said why when I was an existing customer? I cancelled the direct debit until the contract and amount was accurate. A week later I received an email saying I now had to also pay late payment fee of £12.50. I rang in again to explain this was talk talk error. This took me over an hour. Customer service then said to pay the monies owed and I had to ring in yet again January to get the £12.50 back?!! Why couldn't they just credit my account? No compensation either. Why couldn't staff ring me as I'd already wasted now, over 4 hours trying to renew a simple contract. What a total shambles."

We have had a couple of issues with the dehumidifier itself. The first time we ran it, we came back to the unit to find water all over the floor. There had been no alarm for a full tank and no notification on the app. The unit had however stopped at some point with an error code.
After that, it seemed to be okay and it stopped when the tank was full. However we are still not getting any notification that the tank is full and so it is a guessing game to go and check it."

147151,"From the onset of purchasing a Sharp TV from Currys branch at Effra Road on 17/06/19, I have intermittently experienced problems with the device. This has ranged from the tv suddenly shutting down and restarting, the picture and remote freezing, being thrown out of applications, etc.
> This was very irritating; particularly as it caused me to miss parts of programme due to the wait involved while it initialized.
> I first contactind the repair line Teamknowhow (TKH) in August 2019, and a number of times thereafter, and on each occasion was advised to reset the TV. I did this on a number of occasions subsequently but finally lost patience and contacted TKH again on 22/10/19 and following discussion they agreed to accept the TV for repair. The TV was collected from my home address on 23/10/19 at which point I was advised it would be returned on 28/10/19. On 25/10/19 I received a text message informing me that ""my item had safely arrived at the repair center"". On 27/10/18 I received a further text message informing me that my TV's delivery would take place between 07:55 and 11:55 on the aforementioned date I had to take the day off work to accommodate them. At approximately 11.40 on 28/10/19 a delivery driver arrived and after informing me he had my TV proceeded to seach the vehicle only to then inform me he could not find it. I waited as he spoke to the warehouse and then informed me it had not been loaded onto the van and that I would be contacted by TKH regarding the issue later that day. The phone call did not come. I contacted TKH the same day and was informed it had missed the van because they found another issue with the television the day before it was meant to be delivered. Subsequently received a message (without negotiation) informing me that the delivery was arranged for 31/10/19. Unfortunately, the delivery date coincided with the resurfacing of my road and despite the TV being quite light, the delivery driver abandoned the delivery without even attempting to contact me. I would have been more that willing to meet him with my ID to collect my TV; given I had taken a further day off work to accommodate the delivery. Through pure exasperation I contacted TKH to demand a refund. The staff member agreed to my request, said she was unable to send me a confirmation email but instructed me to return to Currys with my receipt as she had put the information on their system. My visit to Currys was futile and after 2 hours with customers service, during which the sales assistant spoke to his manager and TKH but informed me the refund could not be made as they had to physically received the TV before doing so. In my presence he arranged the delivery of the TV back to Currys (Effra Road) for 01/11/19 as I have been unable to take further time off work. I was advised to return to Currys on the aforementioned date and assured the problem would be rectified then. I returned to the store on that date only to be told the TV had not been delivered to them. I am extremely angry about the treatment received from TKH from the onset and by Currys apparent inability to rectify the situation. I have since returned to Currys on 3 separate occasions to experience the same process of them delivering the tv back to the store. In addition I have spoken with different TKH staff members (as a manager is never available) but the issue has yet to be resolved. The last straw was their complaints department emailing me today instructing me to return to the store to sort it out despite the fact that they (TKH) have the TV and I have yet to be reimbursed.
I will never purchase a product from Currys as long as live and will advise anyone I know of the same. Disgraceful customer treatment by both!"

121182,"My tenant waited in for 3 hours waiting fo the engineer. The engineer no-showed. There was no communication. The online-status for the job changed to ""call aborted"". Impossible so far today to speak with a human about it. Automated answer phone keeps hanging up on me. Life is too short for service providers like this. This was in London by the way. I have previously used the service in Brighton where it worked acceptably (not entirely glitch free, but acceptably)"

The products were majorly delayed - not PCSpecialists fault really, but some additional contact would have gone a long way to making me feel more looked after.
One of the servers arrived faulty, and it's taken til now (Feb 2022, order in Nov 21) to be resolved - even though I'm still waiting for a finalised response about a lingering issue - I'm risking making the server live, but it's made me really untrustworthy about purchasing more servers from PCS."

Internet connection has got progressively worst every single bloody year. Can’t even play a game whilst someone has Netflix open, otherwise you’ll be sitting there with 150 ping in servers located in London. Had new sockets placed, had a new hub, and boosters and it’s still a download of blood 10-20 and uploading of 10. It’s ridiculous.

Will insist a new package will fix every issue and it never does, just swindling older folk who have no idea what their on about."

144571,"I received a 5g broadband hub which never got working despite a ""no engineer required"" headline on the product. I also selected a ""no rolling contract"" product so was very surprised to be charged another £27.94 for a service I never activated.

I spend over an hour trying to get through to them on the phone asking many times to cancel my membership and the reason it never worked. And I'm told by this rep ""okay I'm now going to guide you through activating your account"" NO I don't want this anymore. Awful customer service they're either going to not listen to my request, or ignore it. They then told me I can't cancel until I receive a return label and send the router back.

The label never arrived. I contacted my bank who assured me that as long as I have attempted to reach the company about the payments (which I did over the phone) I could block recurring payments with my bank which I have.

Then the calls started. It was weekly calls from the start of this month - I'm no longer paying for this service yet they've decided to continue with keeping the account open (never activated the product or Sim as confirmed on the phone when they tried to proceed with activating it). And then the calls were every 2 days, and now theyre calling me every day, angry that I've blocked payments and never received their returns label.

0800 033 8015. I've now blocked the number. I'm not activating my account and I'm not continuing to pay for an item that doesn't work.

Worst experience I've ever had with a company

Update - they've tried to call me yet again. How don't they realise they aren't reaching me? This company is mental"

117432,"This company charges you £20 a month for genuinely the worst quality streaming service out there. Just talking about stream quality / interface for a second: they make you download a fresh browser to view content and NEVER remember what you were watching when you were last on their site (meaning they manage to simultaneously be the most expensive and least navigable streaming site out there).

After charging you £20 a month, you have to sit through probably 7-8 mins of ads for every 45 minute episode of TV you want to watch. I kid you not these people have the audacity to put ads on their content after taking £20 out of your pocket every month.

You wake up one day and realise they're robbing you, so you go to cancel your membership. Ok sweet, that's all taken care of, problem solved, let's never think about this revolting website again. NOPE, you realise that the ""Cancel membership"" button you clicked last week before moving on with your life was in fact the first of, and I kid you not, FIVE confirmation pages where you have to scroll through they're disgusting ads and attempts to lure you back in (which, if you have a shred of sanity, won't do anything other than add to the pain, torture and disgust of having to spend more time on this website) to let this genuinely sickening company know that you do in fact want them to stop taking £20 out of your bank account every month.

The taste of disgust left in my mouth following use of this website was so rank that I download and signed up to UK Trust pilot just to write this review."

183458,"My elderly dad has a phone line with Shell. The line is faulty and hasnt worked for nearly a month. Shell have:

1 - mishandled the booking of a repair of his line on numerous occasions.
2 - promised a repair was booked on four occasions when no repair has been booked or completed.
3 - failed to call us back when promised.
4 - failed to acknowledge or deal with 2 complaints.
5 - freely given information without my fathers consent on one call then refused on another.
6 - put the phone down on us twice.
7 - Said they would make a £65 charge for repairing a faulty line.

They clearly dont care that an elderly customer is without his lifeline. They talk to us one day then refuse the next.

I recommend avoiding this company. They appear uncaring, unorganised and unwilling to resolve the repair of my dads phone line."

126212,"Absolutely disgusted with these lot, over two and a half months to get a washing machine fixed and they still haven’t done it yet. I’ve paid my care plan for years and as soon as you need something repaired the circus begins. I wouldn’t be exaggerating if I said I’ve spent well over 10 hrs on the phone trying to get this resolved. Just yesterday I spent over an hr on the phone and got passed to five different people before the 5th simply hung up on me. They bring in contractors to do the work and blame it on them, I speak to them (hotpoint) and they blame it on knowhow. You are literally passed about like a tennis ball. The knowhow staff really couldn’t care less what your problem is, it’s like talking to zombies, yesterday the first guy i got through too just stopped speaking to me then started talking to someone in the background in a different language. I first reported the fault on the 1st December 20 it’s now 17th Feb 21. The first engineer changed the drum, which didn’t help, the second replaced the suspension, which didn’t help, and the third took out the new drum and new suspension to put a new drum back in and fit new suspension, only to find the new drum he brought with him was actually cracked and had to fit the old new drum back in. You really couldn’t make this up it’s like something you’d see in a sitcom. Theres absolutely no management or anyone that takes responsibility for Team knowhows actions. It’s like trying to communicate with aliens sitting smoking pot all day, in fact that’s an insult to aliens because I believe they’d be much more cooperative. It’s like a bad relationship, you put everything in for years and they take and take and once you need them they shove it where the sun don’t shine. Team know nothing will not help you, every person I’ve spoke to (I’ve lost count) couldn’t care less. These people are con men/women take your money and hide behind a phone."
193824,"Complete shambles. Don't bother signing up.

Repair man came after 3 days said a part needed ordering. Got an email saying it had been ordered and I didn't need to do anything else.

Called Domestic and General the next day to see when I could expect the part and repair only to be told that they had cancelled my policy. I hung on for 30 minutes and spoke to 4 people to find this out. I asked to speak to manager as I couldn't understand why I had no confirmation of the policy being cancelled as I didn't want to be charged I hung on for another 10 minutes and then spoke to a further two people who said they would put me through to a a manager. In the end after an hour I am still unsure why the policy was cancelled, why I received an email to say that a part was being ordered. And why I still haven't received a confirmation of my policy being cancelled by domestic and general.
Don't bother using this business it's a complete waste of time. Not to mention when the repairer came out he left the dishwasher full of water 😂 so in an even worse state than when he arrived."

We had been quoted £9.99 per phone for 30 days, but after another looooong call with various BT departments, we have now been told it is not available! Misinformation at the point of sale, and though each person we spoke to tried to help, it is clear that BT as a company is just not bothered about its mobile customers. The EE side of things is where they are putting their effort, so heaven help the BT customers!!


Reply to Robbie
Thank you for your kind offer of help, however I don’t use either Twitter or FB. I would rather have a reply to the complaint which was raised on 5 November ( by your own staff, as apparently it was the only way to progress matters). We have, to date, received an acknowledgment email and nothing further."

178381,This scamming company needs to be named and shamed. Same as one of the other reviews trade in £95 for Samsung s8 and get 100 bonus due to phone being purchased. All seems OK until no contact after trade in sent despite being advised cashback will take 3-5 days. DON'T BELIEVE THIS AS IT IS A LIE. After them successfully receiving the phone 17 March it takes 4 online chats and 2 telephone calls to get a response about my trade in finally I get one 7 April. Guess what after you have had my phone for 21 days there is now damage to it and they class it as non working. The damage is also not specified in their own terms and conditions as something that will class the phone as non working. This company have their own rules that they follow to please themselves. Customer service is shocking and to get your business they lie to you about everything. DO NOT TOUCH WITH A BARGEPOLE! it's not worth the hassle.

I signed for a special offer of 3 month for a £1 per month
I have absolutely no recollection of also having signing up for a boost at £5 a month till I saw it having been taken from my credit card.. Till then I had no idea what a boost even was. When I tried to get it cancelled and refunded it was like trying to get blood out of a stone. With much persistance I got my refund
I continued with my discounted subscription
I saw 3 films that Interested me after which all I could find were old films I'd already seen long ago.
I was since shocked to find that I have to watch 5 adverts ahead of each film. What's worse is if you don't like a film and try watching something else you have to watch another 5 ads each time
Something one doesn't ecpect from a Paid subscription channel.
Needless to say I will cancel before the next pay date comes around and never use NOW TV again"

I have contacted the company various time’s and each time I have been informed I will receive my refund ‘within 3 days’ to which I have had no avail.

So, now my wife has this Nokia and she had some troubles, so back to Carphone who have always been great. Not this time, not at the PC World outlet. My wife was working through the problems with a helpful male assistant when the manager interrupted, told my wife to keep quiet when she attempted to explain and continued in an aggressive, sometimes condescending and always arrogant diatribe without ever knowing what the problems were. So, do the logical thing and write to Carphone customer services- did that, still waiting for so much as an acknowledgement nine months later. Guess where I won't go for my next phone."

I made an online purchase for a new iPhone 12 £620 on 25th July the site said it was in stock and would be delivered on 27th July.
The phone was a gift so the delivery address was different to the billing address , payment was taken immediately from my debit account.
When I didn’t receive a tracking number we got concerned so we contacted online customer services who locked our account saying we failed security checks because they do not accept billing addresses & delivery addresses to be different. I also contacted customer services by phone who refused to talk to me when I asked for the order to be cancelled & said we had to go into a branch with 2 forms of ID before I could request a refund. We went into a local store at Selly Oak today where they refused to help saying they can’t help because the account is locked. We then spent another hour on the phone with customer services who said that they don’t have the phone in stock.. they said that we can cancel the order which they would do & send us an email confirmation which we still don’t have from them 😡😡 we’ve called again at no avail today & have been told they can’t do anything because the account is locked. Why lie to customers?
I am £620 out of pocket with no way of getting a refund , I will now have to wait 15 days to claim the money back from my bank through the dispute process this is such awful service!
Carphone warehouse -
1. Why do you deceive customers re stock availability?
2.Why did you accept the order in the first place if your policy treats billing & delivery addresses as Fraudulent?
3.Why is your customer service so disgraceful? You won’t have a business if you continue on this deceitful trajectory!!"
152753,"Some of the reviews looks fantastic unfortunately my experience has been dreadful. Ordered an Apple X on 15 July. Have contacted the company numerous times and feedback has ranged from please be patient to your refund will take time - not necessarily in that order.
Have now sent a final tweet and mail - will be taking matter further next week if no assistance is forth coming.

In reply to your reply:

Have done this on perhaps five occasions. Automated replies ranging from please be patient to your refund will take 14 days ( did not request one at that stage).

I want to establish the status of my order - is someone capable of at least informing me of that instead of just fobbing me off with ""contact customer service"" - there is no service forthcoming there.

Going from bad to worse."
183839,"Waited and waited for a new cooker to be delivered but it did not arrive at the allocated time.
I was not informed that the delivery would not be arriving!
Phoned the company, extremely slow to answer, keep on the phone waiting to speak to someone for quite a while.
Part of their reply to my email is below.
‘ Whilst I understand the frustration caused, as you will appreciate there are circumstances that are out of our control. It is circumstances such as these that can sometimes lead to a delay in our delivery drivers causing delay in their arrival.
In relation to your delivery date, you are more than welcome to contact us’
A delay in their arrival, the delivery driver never came
The email did not tell me what circumstances were out of their control.
I’ll have to waste some more of my time if I contact them on the phone for a new delivery date.
They’ve already wasted enough of it."

154541,If there was a no star option I would use that. Ordered and paid for I phone 8 plus on 27th September. Received an email saying it would be sent within 5-10 working days. Many empty promises broken. QFM featured this week on BBC One show as a dodgy outfit. My promised refund has yet to materialise. I have started the charge back with my credit card provider.
148611,"Order placed on 4th December and have not received my phone or sim. Order is showing as ""Processing/Pending"".

Spoken to customer services three times (each call had nearly an hours waiting time) and still have had no progress on the order.

Call 1) advisor stated gender is missing on application as title was Dr. I gave them the relevant info and was advised order will now complete.
Order remains as ""Processing/Pending"".

2 days later
Call 2) pretty much same conversation as call 1 but advisor promised to call back later in day once order was updated and processed. Never called back
Order remains as ""Processing/pending"".

4 days later
Call 3) started off as previous calls but this advisor was more helpful. Looked into the application in more detail and found error was with the network (Three) so I was put through, and the Three network advisor couldn't find my application on their system!

MPD advisor said he'll speak to his superior and figure out what's going on and call me back. Of course that didn't happen and order remains ""Processing/pending"".

Now I am stuck with £280 gone from my account and no new phone/sim for 10 days as of now.

UPDATE: Today the third advisor called back twice, first to update on order then shortly after to inform me order is ""Packaging"" status. Amazing! Chibuzo has been helpful, polite and followed through until issue resolved - this is what good customer service looks like!

UPDATE 2: 4 hours later and phone is dispatched!"
123230,"You came with a recommendation from a neighbour, who has been dealing with you for years. My old Hoover broke and I ordered a replacement from you the same day. There was some £40 off and free next day delivery. It came on time and it is extremely good. Thank you."
172152,"Assistant was excellent, however I was informed that for a change to show on my online account would take 10 days and that to refund my balance would take 14 days due to finance team checks. Seems I am correct not to trust Shell to be able to accurately bill me, as they clearly also do not trust the figures from their own systems."
123606,"We recently bought a new hoover from Gtech and have had brilliant customer service. We have had a Gtech hoover for years, and although it is still going strong it's performance is not as good as it was, so we wanted to upgrade.

We went for a different type of hoover but it didn't suit us, and have now upgraded to the system with an upright and a handheld hoover. Gtech was great and helped us swap the hoover to get the one that we were pleased with. Really happy to have a new powerful Gtech to whiz round the house."

Fab service from him. Was told to ring in morning for a new delivery he notified his senior who agreed to contact AO as well with details. Now on me ringing American voiced representative asked the problem was told didn't know anything would have to investigate what happened who delivered what was wrong. 48 hours should cover it then they could sort out the problem. I bloo my top. I paid very close on £500 well £492 to be precise up front due to all online orders these days. Spent ages on the phone to argue for my money back finally got it sorted but have to wait 3-5 days for it to go in bank great eh. Down a washer and have to wait for the money in my bank. I am totally gobsmacked as I've used them before they were good but after this experience never ever again if I was you I would buy from elsewhere. Goodbye HAHaHaAOL

140622,Disgusting behaviour from their employees. Had a difficult time in the last year with my mother dying. I continuously receive calls from them. If I block one number they call me on another. I have told them to take me off their database but they ignore.
146410,"I will be sending a letter of complaint as the service is appalling! Let down on 2 installation dates, which isn't good when you work online and have no internet! This also means I lost money and I will be applying for compensation. The day before the first installation date, they moved the date out 3 weeks, with no apology! Then I needed permission from the neighbour, which they knew about 3 weeks prior. I feel it was used as a delay tactic as that was just before the New Years holiday, so everyone was away. Why was I expected to obtain this and not Virgin? Why did they leave it 3 weeks before advising this requirement? I'd just moved house and hadn't met my neighbour at that stage. Thankfully, she is lovely and tried to help as much as possible. Virgin did not advise anyone of the actual work required, they just expected my neighbour to sign! To date, I still have no idea what's happening, nobody responds, nobody apologises, they just expect you to wait! I've now canceled Virgin and my god, that was just as painful! How can they continue to get away with this appalling service?

Virgin - Why don't you call me with an update!"

The TV was a special order and as such there was a waiting time until I received my new TV. An estimated time of mid-end Jan was quoted however I received my new TV two weeks after placing the order. Richer Sounds is definitely the place to shop as they have great service, quality products and very good prices"

I have been paying for a bundle with TV, broadband and telephone for 18 months. After 8 calls and 8 promises of a technician to come out to fit this (and 8 days booked off work to wait in for him) one finally came out in December. He told me it was not possible to fit the tv and I needed a stream box. I rang up and told virgin this but they assured me the technician was wrong and that they’d send another technician out. When the second tech came out he told me exactly what the first tech had told me and that I’d need a stream box. I’ve spent 3 hours on the phone since trying to sort this out but had no joy whatsoever. Use anybody except virgin. They have the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced in any company in the world in my 32 years of living!!"

154602,Pay monthly insurance and have done for some time. Problem started with screen and losing vision on the screen. large black and purple mark creeping over screen contacted Team Know-How Car Phone Warehouse on four occasions. no one logged any details.One man said he had dealt with it but he had not. Was passed to one staff member after another across several phone calls expected to wait unreasonable lengths of time. Was not given reason for the long waits or why they could not address the problem. No one could agree whether I could receive a service despite paying monthly insurance. Was promised communication would be returned but no one returned or offered any help. All i received was an invite to provide a review. Still cant use phone despite needing it for a sick family member. One of the worst experiences ive had so far.
199925,My problem was resolved in less than 10 minutes. I had to do nothing on my end. Fantastic experience. Well done and thankyou !

160587,"Bought a 'good' condition reconditioned phone, all worked fine except for the battery which didn't hold its charge and was 'significantly degraded' according to the apple battery health indicator on the phone. What is the point of ratings if 'good' doesn't even hold the battery charge and the battery needs replacing? Tried to call customer service and got cut off 6 times in a row...Really disappointing and a total waste of time."

149043,"Needed to find a local upholstery cleaner. Asking neighbours and friends living in same area (RURAL SW SCOTLAND) proved unfruitful.
Have booked a company for the beginning of December...hence only giving 4 stars but having read their reviews hopeful that I won't be disappointed with their work."
110831,"OMG! NEVER, NEVER use this company again. The modem they supply is rubbish. The internet link keeps disconnecting. I got the highest spec connection they have. and their excuse is because it's a higher speed the link is more sensitive. Then why sell me this crap when I was better of with the lower speed? The staff at the call centre are morons and try to buff you off. Another month and I can change my supplier."
110353,"What a ridiculous, poor effort at trying to migrate my landline and broadband from BT to Now. All I landed up with was no broadband for over a month and no solution or anyone who could resolve or care about whatever the unknown problem was. Customer support people are provided with no real information and the ‘Level 2’ support are just a figment of someone’s imagination as they provide nothing of use. No customer care, no support, no come back when promised, nothing. A complete waste of time, effort. Shame on you."

121339,"The Bosch washing machine is fine. Installation poor. I thought I was going to get Hughes installing it, but no. Arrow xl, arrived on time. I explained that my existing machine was hot and cold fill. Installer then switched off hot and cold valves, undid the hot connecting hose and water came out, have you got a bucket your hot valve does not switch off. I then switched off the water supply in the roof, but not before I had water over the carpet and worktop base. He then said"" ""we are not trained for this you know"". What did I pay an installation fee for. Never had a problem with Hughes before. I would have thought that they would have checked water was off before disconnecting the hose. I then spent the morning mopping up the excess water from the carpet. I have spoken to Hughes Customer Service and most of the problem has been resolved. They have been very helpful."
155099,Danny painters and decorates were excellent. (Galway) Prompt response. Danny is an excellent painter. He did a superb job. Very professional.
160401,"Got moved onto Shell Energy when my previous supplier went bust. They completely messed up the switch over process at every possible step. They seemingly didn't want to bill me for my energy despite contacting them multiple times, only resolved after an official complaint was lodged, even that took two months to resolve and ended up with me having a £800 bill.

I was told I could gradually pay off the balance over the coming months which suited me. However within the first months I'm getting threatening emails and texts stating I'm not keeping up with my payments and it could affect my credit score. I contacted them and explained the situation, again reassured I could gradually pay of the balance and wouldn't be chased further... 1 month later the same again, threatening emails!

Now my bills are saying I could save money by changing tariffs, however there's no way to actually change tariffs on their website... I also thought everyone was just on the worst case variable at the price cap. So who knows what's going on. I'll be changing to a new supplier ASAP.

The only good thing is when you get through to their support team, they are all very friendly and try to help, but it all goes wrong somewhere!"

I changed USB ports, updated the system, changed plugs, reset the button on the stick etc. I contacted the customer service team to request a new stick and they sent me through a guide to help which we tried and nothing happened. It briefly worked for 30 minutes until the picture went again. I sent photos of the nowtv picture quality vs Netflix to be told my case was escalated and they would be in touch within 48 hours. They didn't contact me at all so I sent another email that requested a refund. Still no response over a week later! So I cancelled, definitely don't recommend as the quality is beyond poor and their customer service is worse! They simply do not care.
So they won't get any more of my money!!"

I work too hard for my money to go to these people. No one cares when you call, if you can even get through. Honestly one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had. Please go elsewhere."

It just wasn’t clear at the point of order for my “30 DAY SKY SPORTS pass, sharp practice and has completely put me off NOW TV and Sky. Think I will try a new provider. Escalated my case via live chat... wont hold my breath.

No 24h helpline or any info when the service will be back.

Watch out for the Carphone Warehouse phone trade in scam.
They use this as bait to lure customers into ‘affordable’ deals, showing how much you will save through the trade in and then claim your phone is faulty and default on their end of the bargain.
This happened to me. Sent my phone in by post during lockdown to be traded for £140. It was in perfect working order. Carphone Warehouse now tell me that it will not power on and that it doesn’t work. This is a lie. They will only offer me £35.
The dishonesty is shocking. It amounts to fraud.
Carphone warehouse are not offering any resolution now that I am locked into an expensive contract.
Avoid this crooked company at all costs."

The return and replacement was good, although another journey and hassle we didn’t need.
The price promise was truly awful - I actually felt like a fraudulent criminal asking you to price match ‘your own’ price reduction on the Boxing Day sale. It got so bad after I had been refused by 2 members of staff that I had to ask to see the manager - 10mins later waiting for him he sanctioned the price match. Hard not to given the price match was your own. Poor customer service"

I posted it to them, they replied inspected and re-valued at £135. because of more than 5 scratches. I disputed this and refused, asked them to send the phone back to me. They then made me another offer of £155. I refused and asked for the phone to be sent back to me asap. It was returned and in the same scratch free perfect condition as before, I have since sold it for the offered price. Con merchants, they want you to send your phone then haggle hoping you’ll give in and sell it for much lesser price. Many people same issue. Don’t use Mazuma!

158742,"Disgusting service. We switched my grans Internet, phone package from BT to Talk Talk/Sky. Since the switch, my 89 year old gran has loss the access to her phone, this is the only way she understands how to contact people. Post multiple calls to Talk Talk the only thing we've got is mixed messages from the staff from suggesting they'd sort it on the day, to the next day to 48 hrs...and the time just keeps increasing. How they can do this to an elderly lady while still accepting our money is disgusting. They have the ability to send technicians out to instal a temporary line to ensure my gran has access to help if she needs, but refuse to do so. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS SCAM. I can not believe Sky is associated to these guys. The most unhelpful service providers with a special shout out to customer service member Anne- Marie"

36 days post connection date and my 83 year old vulnerable mother is still left without any means of contacting family or emergency services in the event of a medical incident
Both Vodafone and Openreach are simply not fit for purpose. The government needs to step in and shut down operations for both these companies.
Openreach has the monopoly, with nearly all providers relying on them to connect their broadband services
Openreach have failed to attend 3 appointments without contacting the account holder, this is despite having the situation explained to them.

165268,"After cancelling my Direct Debit with Shell Energy, so I could move over to a new variable direct debit based on my usage. Shell Energy on 3 occasions refused to setup a new direct debit and have lied to even suggest that they have. This has been investigated by the energy ombudsman and also my bank, and it has been confirmed with evidence to show that Shell Energy have not even attempted to setup a new direct debit, and continued to use the old direct debit cancelled last year. So this meant I could only pay for bills using my debit card. They are completely guilty of charging you a much higher direct debit not based on your usage, and if you cancel this, they will not allow you to move over to a new direct debit based on your usage which will obviously be lower. So if you don't want this to happen to you please avoid, and throughout this whole process they have acted dishonestly."

104601,"Fast service but no option to add a different name for delivery - only a different address-which can cause obvious problems. And they use DPD to deliver, who, I’ve discovered, don’t bother to phone when the driver is faced with a gated complex of flats. Altogether an abysmal service and I won’t be using them again.

In response if DPD do offer the facility to add instructions, it must be hard to find as even my daughter couldn’t find this. In addition, if the item is a present and the delivery address is different, the item is obviously not to be delivered to the person paying the bill. Even Groupon allow you to add a name to the delivery address if different."

Then I have been offered a second replacement. The third one was in acceptable tolerance limits except some mechanical problems. FFX has offered to send replacement parts for defective ones which is fine for me because I am very exhausted swapping out the products continously.
Why did I give 5 star?
Because the problems were related with the products not the seller and FFX tried to do their best to solve the problems.
It was a very busy discount sale period and the courier services were awfull because intensive delivery season. But the seller tried to solve the problems which is the important point for me.
I am waiting for the replacement parts and hopefully I can start to use the product asap."

130051,"I wrongly assumed click and collect here worked like argos but it has teething problems. First off the member of staff in union street who had to deal with me in store was fantastic. I ordered a go pro 7 and went to collect it and the sd card when the email said so. Only the sd card was there. I had to buy a hero session 5 as i needed a camera for filming that day. I also picked up another sd card. Well- one of the sd card i bought was corrupt. The hero 5 was garbage for what i need. I now face a trip to cex to return the card. So when you order online the cash comes out right away but it doesnt return to your account as fast. Without the refund for the hero 7 -there and then- i couldnt buy a more expensive hero so got stuck with the hero five. Nightmare. Almost dropped tears in their store. If i were to advise cex- they should look at temp hire of equitment when things like this happen. I would of been happy having the more expensive hero- the inability to sort the money/refunds was the issue here. Aside from issues they are having passing correct click and collect information to customers, the instore staff were very good. Ive hopefully just been very unlucky."

183940,"On balance, the worst streaming service.
Pros:
Good selection of films

Cons:
- On PCs it requires the installation of a separate program to watch films, which is an absolutely pointless extra step. Also sometimes means that instead of just clicking on a film and starting watching it straightaway, it will require an update, which then means you have to reinstall the program, reclick to watch the thing you wanted to watch and then wait for the program to reopen.
- Website layout is poor
- They show unskippable ads before films, which you have to pay £5 extra not to have. This was already the most expensive streaming service I have (£10/month), even without that extra cost.
- Expensive
- For some reason, requires logging in twice every time you try and watch film. Doesn't sound like a big thing but it gets grating.

So, all in all, garbage."

My Experience with this company has been appalling

Update: i can not fault how espares have handled this since being aware, they have been really responsive and have been in touch to let me know they have found the part. Thank you for sorting this out it's really appreciated, the wife might leave me alone now

*in response to Barks response
- you flag my review as fake but then I prove it is legitimate so are forced to respond
- the get hired guarantee is nonsense, the leads are replaced with equally poor leads so there is no guarantee, just a chance to waste more of your time.
- every lead I purchase, the client is contacted immediately, still no response.
- the “automated” vetting is just a text message sent to the customer. It is not vetting anything, it just shows someone has a phone.
- Ive requested you contact me, sent emails and you don’t respond, why would I take the time to contact you again when all you say is “sorry, it is against policy to return credits if you can’t contact the customer”

I’m sorry but nothing you have said helps anyone, these leads are exceptionally expensive and absolutely awful quality"

Web sites that say: ""you can terminate your subscription by filling in this form"" and get you to click on a link that then doesn't lead you to a form, surprise, surprise ...

Talktalk put you on hold then disappear, gift cloud is somewhere in the sky. It's a complete joke and I'm afraid it looks like they are a bunch of incompetent chancers. Do not be taken in by them!

Over the phone had created an account without a phone line (I didn’t ask for that) and just closed it. Beating in mind I was on the phone to them a couple of times a week because of various in-going issues. I’ve had to set up another account - the 5th since May which I’m only doing to have internet through the connecting hub and I’m leaving to go to Virgin (account already set up with Virgin, can’t wait to get rid of BT!. I was supposed to have received a cheque for my compensation, still waiting and because the account is closed nobody can see if it’s been sent out. Honestly, don’t join BT it’s a full time job having to contact them to try and get the service you signed up for. Horrid company"

112400,Abysmal streaming quality no matter how good your broadband package is. Always freezes and hangs. Useless for watching big games. Avoid.
198306,"I am now 7 months into my contract and pleased with my Now Broadband and TV. I do have some minor gripes in terms of the layout of the website and lack of information regarding your account, for example there is no indication of what your phone number is, something the help pages and forums state you receive an email, but I never got it. I no longer have a landline phone and only wanted the number in order to use it for those pesky websites that insist on phone numbers when you make contact, I figured if they wanted to cold call, they could cold call to a phone that never rings or gets answered.

The layout regarding the TV programs could use polishing, there was no A-Z so far as I could find, meaning you have to browse sections in order to see if a program you want to watch is there.

In terms of the APP on the firestick, Alexa ignores the existence of Now TV and if I do have a program saved and say ""Play program name on Now"" or ""Play program name> on Now TV"" or Open program name> on Now etc, I instead get taken to Amazon Primes offering of the program which is usually chargable and either way only available if you subscribe to Prime. Whether or not this is an issue with the NOW TV app or with the firestick and Amazon pushing their own products, I am not certain and have been unable to find any information regarding it. However it only seems to happen with my NOW programs which would suggest an APP error.

I cannot comment on the included router, since I used my own, but have had no issues aside from the expected internet drops you occasionally get with all services.

Another thing I like about NOW is that it is was only a 12 month contract even with a cashback offer on Quidco, thus far the prices have not been raised, a pet hate of mine when taking fixed term contracts is when the company raises the prices a few months in.

It is doubtful I will remain at the end of the contract, since there will likely be a tempting cashback offer from another supplier and this may be when I revisit this review, because this is usually where all broadband suppliers fail, they allow you to join without a telephone call, but will not allow you to leave without contacting them by telephone. We shall see how NOW works in this respect, when the time comes, but it should be acceptable to give notice by email."
107500,"Bt,just about to get shot of them once and for all,they are nothing but a money grabbing shower of complete liars,called on Sunday 8.00 we have no phone or broadband, they said we will send an engineer as we have found a fault,we dont need to enter home,2 days later we call them and explain that my father is in a assisted living complex and bedbound, doctors said 2 fail to move and put him on palliative care,our signals on mobiles are very poor so we use wifi calling,they are now saying Thursday before they can look at it,when you talk to them they say we will call back,they never do,bt wifi is very good when it is working but if you have a problem they are pathetic,"

156073,"We had a Currys Essentials Compact Freestanding Dishwasher bought as a Christmas present for us. Ever since delivery of the item we had issues.

We had the dishwasher delivered on 23/12/19 (I think) and installation could not be completed as we didn't have some extra parts for it to be fitted (which isn't explained anywhere).We went off to get the additional parts and try and install it ourselves. We got about 90% through it but hit a bit of a roadblock.

We decided to call Team Knowhow again to utilise the installation we had paid for. We finally got to rearrange our installation for 27/12 with a time slot allocated to us. After waiting in throughout this time slot we decided to call them to ensure its still booked.

It took the agent a good 5-10 minutes to find our details due to who ever did the booking to begin with had our house number as a surname and got other parts of our details wrong. They informed us if we haven't had anyone round by 7:30pm to call again. So as expected no one turned up and we was just given the excuse of the team running out of man hours to get round to us then rebooked the installation for 29/12.

So again we waited in for a while on the 29/12 and when it started getting a bit late we decided to call to ensure someone is still coming round. The chap we spoke to took our details, and said nothing is scheduled for us at our address. Then starts to book us another appointment, to which we declined and wanted the unit picking up and returned for a refund. To humour myself I asked the agent to search for us using the incorrect details and hey presto he found it and said ""oh he saw that one for our address but thought it was an error""

Luckily the installation team turned up about an hour later which was both useless and useful at the same time. We explained that we have the parts to complete the installation but they still declined actually installing it.

We was told that the installation team are not able to do any plumbing at a property due to insurance. So they essentially just told us what we needed to do to complete to installation and we did it ourselves.

What is the point of paying for our items to be expertly fitted/installed if they cant actually do it? We have basically paid to let some guys come into my property to tell me how to do it then leave.

UPDATE: After being told what we needed to do to complete the installation ourselves. Couple of days later, we had a phone call from a driver for Team Knowhow asking saying they have been tasked to come and pick the dishwasher up to return it! First I knew anything of this, so I told him dishwasher is fine and we didn't request it to be returned."

155667,"The device arrived a lot later than advertised..

Also a credit note of £15 previously agreed to be issued & paid back for another very late delivered device was never provided..."
147371,I was tricked into entering a 24 month contract by one of their agents. They will not give me a copy of the contract or a transcript of the conversation with the agent. I am now stuck with a terrible provider. They have not offered me any reduction in my cancellation fees in spite of me not even realising I was on a contract. Do not go for this company. Their customer service is horrendous. They also charge you to use your phone abroad - even in France - £2 per day.

124700,"I had read the warnings but foolishly thought that as we previously were connected via SKY and 'NOW' is part of Sky there would be no issues. I signed up on the 17th of March, paid the fee for the router delivery and was informed that the go-live date was 31st March. I thought nothing more of it until today 28th March when I received an email from SKY confirming the cancellation of my services with them and asking if I had arranged another provider as they were yet to hear from anyone! I then logged into my 'NOW' account and discovered that, without any notification at all, they had cancelled my account! There was no explanation as to why they had done this. I contacted them via Twitter and they asked me to phone customer support. I NEVER discuss accounts over the phone because I want everything in writing. Too many times in the past I have agreed to something on the phone only to be told later that the company has no record of it. So I do things via email or social media. Any company that insists I speak to them on the phone is not getting my business. Luckily I signed up to 'NOW' with my PayPal debit card so I was able to cancel that payment process...just in case NOW ""forgot"" they cancelled my service and tried to take the money. Some may be lucky and get great service with NOW broadband but I will never trust them again."

136769,"A few months ago, I was looking to buy a house. After logging in to check my latest credit score, it was completely in the red. Upon investigation, I found that shell had created an account illegally in my name for an old address I lived at years ago and had run up a bill of £800+ without ever even contacting me. I have never in my life even had a account with Shell.

I have been fighting with them for 3 months to get this resolved and they still have not done so. Sometimes making me wait a month to even get a reply. I have asked for them to confirm their details so that I can raise this with the energy ombudsman but they refuse to give me their details.

If this is how Shell treat people who aren't even customers of their then I dread to think what they are like for actual customers. I would avoid them at all costs if you can.

I am now having to look into getting legal representation to get this resolved."
160649,"I would rate this 0 stars if I could. EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! Yesterday, I ordered Apple AirPods 2nd Generation and the order process was so smooth. I was told I’d receive my AirPods on the 3rd January. Today I woke up to an email saying that they’ve had to cancel my order because it didn’t pass their internal security checks. When I called to further investigate this silly issue, they said they couldn’t reveal what went wrong and the woman had poor communication skills, giving me attitude even though it was THEM who cancelled MY order that I payed £124.49 for. I should be getting a refund in 3-5 business days which is such a setback for me because I should be seeing AIRPODS ON THE 3RD JANUARY!!! Words cannot describe my outrage with this unprofessional, disgusting company. I’ll NEVER buy anything from them ever again and I don’t think anyone else should either, not even in store due to their bad customer service. I’m taking myself to another more SECURE site that actually offers me INSURANCE aswell, unlike this rubbish."

Explained the situation and provided them with masks but they kept forgetting to put them back on and even when reminded they left their nose sticking out so the mask was pointless. Really poor tbh, appreciate Covid isn't an issue for most people anymore but no excuse for not taking care around those still at risk."

179421,"I bought a tv from them. That was fine but I also paid for them to recycle my old tv. They took the tv as planned but 30 minutes after they left I went out and found the tv dumped at the communal bins. Not only did the council not take the tv away, it was a hazard for others. I asked for AO to either come back and recycle the tv (at their own depot as planned and booked for) or give me my £20 refund.
They have constantly ignored me. That is theft for me to specifically pay for something and them not deliver/do it. They have continued to ignore my response for a refund. That's terrible customer service, and basically theft. Be wary of them. There actions to me indicate they are more like a cowboy outfit."
191363,"Called in advance & asked if they could arrive half an hour early. Excellent. Once they arrived they came in (made proper use of the door mat) to make sure everything was in order. One of the drivers then took away the old cooker as his colleague began the electrical work. New cooker was wheeled in & installed. Both guys were pleasant, polite & chatty only leaving after one cleaned up as the other demonstrated the operation of my new cooker. All in all a tremendous experience. Highly recommended."

113718,"I have had the worst experience dealing with Quick mobile fix. They have continually promised and haven’t delivered on time. My daughters phone broke down and I ordered her a phone from them because they promised delivery within 2-3 working days. Turns out that for refurbished phones the delivery time is actually 10 working days. The phone never arrived on time . It absolutely broke my heart to see my daughter run to the door everytime there was a delivery. We waited and waited. In the end feeling very frustrated I cancelled my order and asked for a refund. Quick mobile fix promised me a refund within 14 working days. It is today the 25th working day and my money has still not reached my bank. They have now promised me a refund date if 10th of July. I first ordered my phone in April. DISGRACEFUL!!
16/06/2020 - In response to your reply dated 12/06 - it seems like it is normal practice for you to refer your customers who put their trust and money in your hands to be disappointed. I have contacted your customer service team numerous times with no help atall in return and just ask for my money BACK. This matter will end up with the tribunal and trading standards otherwise."

Ordered a pc only to be contacted to say the parts were out of stock, despite the website not indicating so.
I was offered a different part that was Not equivalent of what I had ordered.

The pc arrived and the front fans were poorly set up and the cpu cooler set up such that air would end up in the pump, reducing the lifespan of the pump.

The pc was stuttering and hitching on arrival so I checked the temperatures. The CPU was idling at 60-70 degrees Celsius and thermal throttled under any sort of load. Likely causing the stuttering performance.

I decided to check the thermal compound to find it was basically non existent, despite paying extra for the premium option.

I really placed the thermal compound and now the cpu idles at 20-30 degrees Celsius.

I would not recommend pc specialist to a friend."

123220,"Absolutely shockingly poor customer service seems they are able to carry on selling phones and take in money during the current crisis but are unwilling to honour their obligations to refund customers when things go wrong - my advice to any potential customer is to avoid.

There is no excuse for these kind of delays, 2 or 3 weeks more that the standard time frames is understandable and acceptable in the current crisis but when it runs into months to get a refund that is not customer service its a rip off pure and simple. How do we know they are still going to be in business in a month or two - there is something far wrong here before they are holding on to our money. I find myself wondering if they are going down the tubes and taking our money with them."

119978,"If there was a choice for 0 stars I would’ve given them that. I placed my first ever order with Curry’s 2 weeks ago, a washing machine due to be delivered by ‘team know how’ last Sunday morning. On the day of delivery I received a text to say it would be delivered from 2pm-6pm. So after waiting in all morning, I now had to wait all afternoon too. 6pm came and went with no sign of a washing machine and no further communication from ‘team know how’ and being Sunday, their phone lines were closed... Monday I send a message to customer services asking where my delivery got to. Their response was that it had “been put on the wrong van” and will now be delivered next Saturday! I was asked if I’d like a morning or afternoon slot of which I chose the morning slot. I have now just received a delivery reminder text for Saturday AFTERNOON! So again, my weekend plans revolve around a flippin’ washing machine. It’s ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that I’ve had no access to a washing machine for over a week now! It’s safe to say that I will not be ordering anything from them again in the future."

141239,"Disgraceful. I wrote this email and discussed it with their customer services when I still hadn’t received a response. They said they would give me £20 as a gesture of goodwill which is nowhere to be seen and escalated complaint. They said that I would hear back from someone but I haven’t!. Absolute jokers!

I purchased and paid for a dishwasher in store at Stratford upon Avon at the Maybird on 26 November 2022. I was told by the young gentleman that served me, that I would get a confirmation text message to say when my order was going to be delivered. I got the text message that said it would be delivered on 3rd December which is when I had booked it in with the gentleman in the store. I have had to pay a callout fee for the plumber who was coming to plumb the dishwasher that day. It just went from bad to worse. When I received no further texts or updates, I called on Saturday morning to find out what time the dishwasher was going to be delivered. My partner had taken the day off work unapid(!) to wait in for the delivery too so he lost out on pay. I spent 40 minutes with the customer services lady over the phone only to be told that my order had been cancelled and that she couldn’t give me as reason as to why it had been cancelled. I was extremely disappointed to not have received ANY communication to that effect. When I asked for a refund on my card, the lady said I would have to drive to the store in order for this to be processed! I spent a further 2 hours travelling to the store and petrol money in order to get there in order to get a refund! It’s absolutely absurd that I had to get in the car for this!

My family and I have been using Curry’s for years, so I feel extremely let down by poor customer service on this occasion. I spoke with the Manager at the store on Saturday and she agreed that it wasn’t good enough either and that I should have been told that the delivery had been cancelled. She gave me your email address to write to in order to secure some sort of compensation. We are moving house and we told the young gentleman that we would be back to buy more white goods and a television so you have lost out there I’m afraid."

108029,"Very disappointed of TalkTalk customer service. Basically I call them on 17/08/22 to cancel my broadband service and received a letter to confirm will terminate my internet until 19/09/22. And my last bill will be on 23/09/22. ( The bill date is on 23rd of each month) However I got another bill charged one months later and after contacting their customer service team again , They explained & promised me will be issued the full refund after the bills has been completed in their system. The ridiculous part is when I contact them back 3rd time on 24/09/22 after I was charge for the bill 23/09/22, they told me that I will need to wait for another 10 Woking days for the final bill and won’t be guarantee the full refund.

197329,"Summary:
- I haven't received a broadband
- problem with address: I am sure I put it correctly
- I couldn't cancel subscription, because I didn't know Three number (as I haven't received it)
- no service was provided, but received email with debt
- 2 hours talking with support with no success, they even couldn't find my order (I had my reference number)

Full story:
I ordered a broadband, but I haven't received it.
I contacted delivery: for some reason this parcel had status as refused, it turned out that the address was wrong (I am sure I used a correct address). I contacted support, but they couldn't find my order. They only tried to convince me to open a new contract and I didn't like it, so I decided to find a better provider.
After a week the delivery ensured me that they returned the parcel to a sender.
Later I called a support again trying to cancel my subscription and he ensured me that the time they receive parcel back, my subscription will be cancelled. I thought there is a delay in processing it, so I decided to wait.
A month later I received email telling me that I have a debt.
Here I am, tomorrow I am going to call them again, hope they will cancel it."

Everything I have ordered in the past was delivered and put in my kitchen. I am most disappointed. Why ask how many stairs if you had no intention of carrying it upstairs to my kitchen"

I am too busy trying to get rid of McAfees attack on my sanity to spend precious time dealing with chasing after people who are doing work for TalkTalk free by dealing with irate customers problems on their behalf and who, not being in paid administration, have as much clout as a fly in a spider's web"

They offer to send you a bag to collect it so you can send it to the right place for recycling. We’ve spent hours on the phone to them just asking for this bag so we can recycle this equipment, because if every customer chucked it out the landfill damage would be huge. Each time they say “yes of course we will send it this week sorry”. It has never come. They have made it impossible to recycle and we are going to have to give up.

Didn’t arrive on time constantly chased and was fobbed off with rubbish about the pandemic every time. Offered refund in March which has never been received. It’s gone on so long now that my bank can’t even help me with it. So I’m completely out of pocket.

149399,"Never used before and never will again!
They messaged me to cancel the installation of our new oven just before Christmas because the driver was sick?!

I PHONED THEM and spent over an hour on a very frustrating call trying to rebook (the person couldn’t answer questions without constantly putting me on hold to go and ask someone).

When they did turn up the fitter struggled to fit the oven and I suggested an existing kitchen panel may need removing in order for the new oven to fit? (something I would expect him to have known?). This certainly didn’t fill me with confidence when it came to the wiring up!

The oven I purchased was recommended to only be fitted by a qualified Electrician. I have no idea if the Marks Electrical fitter is an electrician or not?! He didn’t test the existing circuit for suitability, nor provide any installation certificate when requested! He set the oven timer as the clock by mistake and overall I was left questioning his ability!

To top everything, the actual oven itself was FAULTY! Another painful call ensued and I provided videos and photos as requested.

This led to yet another call (again from someone who couldn’t answer any questions without putting me on hold to go find the answer). I eventually spoke to a Manager whose attitude wasn’t particularly helpful and initially wouldn’t arrange a refund and collection.

The faulty oven was eventually collected and refunded. However very disappointed and will NEVER use again!"

I refused and they then offered £95, and I refused again. They send the phone back with scratches to the rear that they caused, without its original box SIM key or lead in just a loose piece of bubble wrap. I complain to customer services, but retentions say they never received the email (liars). I resend the same to retentions and customer service - no response.

Woeful, please avoid.
I have had Pro Gigafast 900 broadband for just over 3 months now. After 8 weeks my line was just shut off one morning for no apparent reason. It seems there was a cancellation order put through, though neither vodafone nor city fibre would take responsibility for this error. I spent more time than you can imagine (6hours on one day) on the phone to and stuck on hold with vodafone. It took 11 days of no internet, a whole new account and checking process to finally get up and running again. I was compensated and I thought that would be the end of it.
Alas, no.
This morning I got up to my broadband not working again, after a queue for 30 minutes I had a wholly unsatisfactory conversation with a ""tech"" person who informed me that City fibre were doing some work and that an outage would last usually for 24-48 hours. There is no warning that this is going to happen so I was just generally inconvenienced.
I have now plugged in the back up dongal supplied and my 910MBS is now running at a download speed of 15.1MBS and an upload speed of 8.93MBS. Whilst this is completely unacceptable, the funniest bit of all is that I am using up the back up data, so in the long run this will cost me when it runs out. The fact is, I should have my quota still as this is yet another situation that the Vodafone and City Fibre partnership has created.
I then asked the ""tech guy"" to put me through to complaints and was told on 4 occasions that I wasn't allowed whilst the outage is ongoing. This will mean that I will have to call vodafone yet again and waste my time becoming irate in a queue again to complain about an outstanding poor service again!
Please avoid, this is not a one off thing, the whole experience is woeful."
119472,I have been with talktalk for my broadband over the last few years and when I tell you their internet is the worst possible thing I have ever experienced in my lifetime I’m not exaggerating.

After 45 minutes I finally managed to get a phone upgrade from Three.
Took ages though, and I got a lot of Ummm's from the customer service advisor.
What should have taken no more than ten minutes dragged out, as the advisor had to keep going off call to I assume take advice.
This is what happens when you have your call centre abroad and not in the UK, using the cheapest untrained labour.
UK call centres are far above the standard of foreign ones and take a fraction of the time to sort the call.
So Three are wasting money employing poorly trained advisors, as they will I assume need to employ 3 advisors for the likes of say 1 BT advisor.
When will these companies learn.

126770,"I feel absolutely ripped off from them.
I bought a refurbished phone from them over a month ago which still has not been delivered. Once you order from them, they tell you that they will send a postal tracking number to notify you that your phone is out for delivery. I'm still waiting on that email and tracking number which I assume I will never get.
I emailed their customer contact after a month after purchase and all they came back with was a weak apology plus a vague response that my order will be despatched as quickly as possible. Its been a week and a half since they responded and still no sign of a tracking number. They claim that my order is being processed as quickly as possible and that its taking ""longer than normal"" because of the pandemic. They never specified how long that ""long time"" meant or how far up I was on the list of the orders that ""are being dispatched as quickly as possible"".
I understand that the issues of staffing and orders getting out are because of the current pandemic but, do not promise your customers that you'll process your order within 10 days and then when you don't hit the mark, not specify how long it will actually take.
Also the fact that they only issue refunds within 14 days of purchase is pretty unheard of... its usually up to 30 days and I'm pretty certain that I won't be getting a refund because they'll turn around to me and claim that I've been way over the 14 day mark. I've sent them another email asking for a refund but I don't think I'll be seeing my money back.
Don't let them take your money, go somewhere more reputable like envirofone, CEX or even ebay."

176725,"I have been with Virgin for 20 years - I put up with the customer service (use that word loosely) as I liked the TV - I'v lost years of saved programmes/films ! After a whole week last February/March where I lost TV/Broadand/Landline, 4 promised visits where no one showed up .. I finally got £210 compensation. I was due to finish my contract in May so I decided to leave. I was called by a guy who promised to be my ""dedicated"" account holder, he would make sure I didnt suffer the same problems trying to contact customer service, I am sure you have all been there, half an hour of calling, to have the phone answered and then half way through telling them your issue .. you get cut off ! I agreed to a new 2 year contract under these terms. However after a month - Virgin took the compensation back, they didn't tell me. I found out by seeing my Direct Debit continue to go out every month to pay my bill. It took a month of phone calls every 2 days to find out why. All I could get out of them was it was ""mis-applied"" so I decided to leave, however that meant I had to pay an early exit fee, I paid under duress as I felt I was cheated by Virgin, I couldn't stay with them for the next 2 years. I gave notice via the BOT. But when it came to my leaving, in August - they had ""no record"" of my conversation, even though I did and said I can send them the screen shots of my conversation. I had to stay another month and that cost me £59. I made a complaint and all I get is letters saying to call customer care and that's their ""resolution"". No one has ever called me, despite being promised call backs. I feel I have been lied to & cheated out of my money .. this is against CPR but they still dont care. Do yourself a favour and dont even enter into a contract with Virgin, you will live to regret it ! I am now with BT and I cant rate them highly enough, they do actually care and I had the best experience of customer service this week, an experienced guy helped me resolve some issues and spent ages talking me through things. Their call centres are in the UK too !"

Said it was 50/50 whether I would receive my items or not!!

I then asked if I could cancel my order due to the inconvenience caused and that I simply do not want the items and for the money to not leave my account.
They have refused to cancel my order and have said if the items are dispatched they will take the payment from my account!! I have stated I need these items and they do not care..

I have tried emailing to resolve the matters and I am constantly speaking to different people who keep telling me to “allow for my items to be dispatched” even though a woman from customer service stated to me they DO NOT HAVE THE ITEMS IN STOCK.

I advise people to avoid this company and by the looks of the previous reviews I am not the only one this is happening to! Apparently they “can’t” cancel the order you have to wait for the item to be delivered and for them to take your money out of your bank account before being able to get a refund🤔 even then by the looks of things they make it hard as possible to get a refund!!

Definitely won’t be using these again, I didn’t know what else to do other then leave a bad review because by the looks of things they aren’t cancelling my order! Absolutely ridiculous. Should really warn people if the delivery is going to take so long! AND if the item’s actually aren’t in stock."

Despite being promised by knowhow customer service department that it will be sorted and that they would contact me I heard nothing. I then waited a week and emailed knowhow customer services and got the usual automated reply ( ref DIX5596489CR ) Twice this has happened now and the latest advising me to take the issue to whirlpool.

193879,"Only giving them one star as I can’t give them negative!

We have an extended warranty on a fridge freezer. Called them a little over a week ago as the freezer was frosting up rapidly. After a short question & answer session it was deemed that the seal was faulty on the door. Engineer visit booked for yesterday. Text recd the day previously advising would be there between 8 & 12 & would call ahead. No call received & engineer arrived 50 mins late with no apology. Fitted the new door seal & left after 10 mins. When my wife came home a couple of hrs later & went into the freezer to get something out, inside of the door was wet. Called them back & was told that it could take up to 5 hrs for the seal to bed down & become effective. By 7.30 still no better so called back again. Despite the problem being through their own poor workmanship, the first date I was offered was next Wednesday for a further engineer visit which I told them was completely unacceptable. When asked how I should claim for the food lost, was told that they don’t pay out for food & I should claim on my house insurance. Somewhat incensed, I asked them how they thought the insurers would accept this as an insured risk to simply receive the same scripted answer. We have had further conversations with them today, including escalating this into a complaint & asking to speak to a more senior person to be told that their managers “weren’t customer facing”!

Update, 10th September.
Despite the seemingly positive response posted to my original review, having responded as asked, it transpired that the department at the end of that strand was also infected with the ""computer says no"" approach! Fire up by this point, I then e-mailed the group chief executive, only to find that the ""computer says no"" approach seems to start from that height!

To cut a very long story short, ended up with a total of three engineers visits ( always on a Wednesday - do they all only work Wednesdays?) & finally got to the point where the unit was scrapped since the problem was presumed to be the door since replacing the seal hands fixed it. Our police provided for the replacement cost so, once we have the code text, trogged off to Currys; found a replacement & tried to use the voucher. Teamknowhow couldn't even get that right since the code they sent me was for another customer, different county & for 5 times what we were expecting. Fortunately, after all the examples of dreadful service we'd received, there ws one final shining light, yes, there is someone ( actually three including the delivery guys) who understands what ""providing the customer with a positive experience"" really means. Even Jay was horrified where we told him some of the ties of woes that we'd experienced.

As I was in the process of buying a new phone I was told it would be an extra £10 to have the data transferred but it wasn't always successful and they didn't know how long it would take so couldn't give me a time to collect it. My daughter noticed the WhatsApp messages had been read and the phone was now fully charged. I decided not to buy a new phone.

I would recommend them and wished I had bought them a couple of years ago.
Reviews I have read stating the plates catch their hair; I have not experienced this but I bought mine directly from GHD. Perhaps those reviews were written on straighteners bought from a less reputable company that we’re not genuine ones."

You have to go through the usual first line of customer service where you are not offered anything decent & certainly can't match the deal i have (not forgetting of course the first advisor you get that hangs up on you when you get through)
Eventually get given a disconnection date. Within a week i get a call from the outbound team (these are the only people that have any clout with deals). He matched the deal i was getting (speed and price )+ would credit my account. If you've dealt with Virgin CS before you will realise that it is common place for them to lie,so i got a little twitchy when he said he couldn't put anything into writing about the account credit. I did receive the contract by email detailing the speed and price.

A week later i still had not had a speed increase. I WhatsApped them & over an 8 hour period was fobbed off and told to wait. A week or so later i tried again and the CS agent tried to sell me another more expensive deal. Explaining that i already had a deal fell on deaf ears, it is like talking to a brick wall with these people. I provided screenshots of my contract but still it was not actioned. Next i tried calling. The guy was helpful and could see the contract i was offered but denied any knowledge of the credit i should have been given. He told me he'd call me back later in the week about it. This never happened of course.He also forwarded another contract that was £10 more than the original contract i was given! I tried webchat next.Treat yourself to something nice if you can find the link for that! I eventually found it by going through complaints.
Hours (5 i think) later the agent who was very sympathetic told me it would go to management to get sorted and he would put in a complaint for me.I actually laughed when the complaint came back with no changes and they'd closed it!

Your complaint was:
Cable -> My Contract/Package -> My package isn't as described
And here’s what we agreed:
Package -> Package correction
We’ve now closed your complaint.

Tired by now of spending hours and hours amounting to days of wasted time i put my notice in under the 14 day cooling off period for the 'new' contract that was still £10 higher than the original contract that was sitting in my inbox that every agent was ignoring. It was then that this agent again tried to sell me another more expensive package than the one that i was actually cancelling in the first place. You couldn't make it up! You honestly get to the point when you feel like it's a game to them. They lie. They fob you off. They pass the buck.
It is certainly the weirdest customer service experience i have ever encountered with a company.
Over and over i was sending them a screenshot of a contract that THEIR outbound team sent me when i didn't even want to stay with them in the first place - i was perfectly happy to switch providers!
Just to add - i went back to the outbound guy on Whatsapp who originally gave me the offer (i saved his number) He apologized then the next day i asked if there was an update and he blocked me!
The companys CS is an absolute joke.If you value your time and stress levels, give them a swerve."

131850,"Would not recommend Quick Mobile Fix to anybody. Took over a month to to receive the handset. I had to keep chasing for updates and all I got was I am priority and handset will be posted soon. Went on for weeks until I emailed to cancel my order, received a call same day to say it will be distributed today. Even when I received the handset kept on getting error message saying “Unable to verify this iPhone has a genuine Apple display” and Face ID did not work which I emailed to their Customer Service. Got a reply to return the handset back to them with fully track service which I had to pay for as they clearly stated they are not liable for covering the cost - but you sent me a faulty handset after waiting over a month? And I would not trust them returning the handset back anytime soon if I sent it, so I did not bother. I ordered my partners handset from iOutlet after mine and got it before mine and the handset was in good working order. They also have a uk based customer service contact number."

I immediately phoned Mobilephonesdirect and explained. Even directing her to their own advert on the mobilephonesdirect website . The call taker told me her manager would have to listen to the recording of my telephone conversation from when I ordered. If the mistake lies with them (and it does), they will arrange a swap. Very stressful.
Update. 24/01/23
MPD accepted fault lay with them . Customers were placing orders for 3rd gen SE 256gb phones but 2nd generation models were being sent out, as I can confirm.
As of 24/01/23 this matter is still unresolved and MPD customer services are in my opinion, not fit for purpose."

I activated the day pass around 17.30 but could not manage to find the channel for the match. I contacted through chat line the customer service at 18.07 hrs until 18.37 was put on hold then got disconnected. I reconnected again at 18.46 to another customer advisor then disconnected again. A third time lucky, another customer advisor after a long chat and verification, offered a credit but refused to refund as the day pass was activated. How could you find out what channel the match is shown on if you don’t activate the day pass. It’s a RIP OFF. DO NOT BUY DAY PASSES FROM NOWTV. I did NOT watch any of their programs."

187820,"I have been with NOWTV for well over a year now. Initially I had issues with instillation when I had my broadband set up but if I'm honest this is an issue with the BT engineers. Customer service was always spot on. They kept my £24 monthly bill even after my renewal (which was meant to go to £41) as standard. Download speeds are always above 30mbs at minimum, download is always above 12mbs too. I have never had a video buffer. I am in a large city so I believe this is probably why I've got such good coverage. Downside is that you NEED a phoneline for this service unlike virgin."

155995,"Carphone warehouse is a scam. I recently bought a new contract through them (Samsung s20 on Vodafone ). The reason I bought this contract is because of their trap TRADE-IN. I had two mobiles, an IPhone X and Samsung S9, both in my personal use and in immaculate condition so Carphone warehouse offered me a total of about £400 plus for both mobiles with in 5 days. I sent both mobiles and for two weeks I heard nothing from them. when I rang, I was told both mobiles are not working and I will be paid 35+70=105 pounds for both. I refused and told them I have proof both mobiles were working fine on the day they were sent (23 November), now they sent me one of the mobiles (Samsung s9) which again I checked and is perfectly fine but still holding my other mobile IPhone X. Today is 22 of December. I called customer service many times but they won't listen. I am looking to file a formal complaint against this dodgy company somewhere who would make them listen. Guys beware of these scammers and don't lose you peace and money to them.

Went on first trip to vegas in March and phoned worked perfect. Now 7 months later on a family holiday in vegas can't use my phone unless I pay £5 a day extra (my daughter has same contract as me so would cost me £140 extra for both of us to use are phones). They say my there roaming policy changed back in May but I had no notification of this happening. Tried customer service (once I could eventually get through to speak to someone and got nowhere). I will be complaining to ofcom on my return from my holiday. In the mean time me and 16 year old daughter can only use are phones if we can get on WiFi.

But nothing delivered and I was working Tuesday so I altered my delivery to a local pick up point it said it would take another 24hours to go through the system which was ok.when I looked on the yodel app for my delivery it just said at depot waiting for instructions that went on till Friday when I rang yodel they couldn’t do anything so I rang very took a hour to get to talk to someone then told me the item was too heavy for local pickup site.so she changed it for home delivery or neighbour so sorted I don’t think so. I looked on yodel app Monday expecting a delivery slot but no still waiting instructions from supplier then Tuesday morning on the yodel app item returned to supplier I was not happy so rang very up and astonished I was got through after only 5 minutes and the lady on the phone didn’t really help just said it’s been returned and I’ll get a refund which I’m still waiting for but did say if i reordered it I would get free postage that was never going to happen

116098,"Ordering, feed back during building and testing, delivery: All very good.
Hardware itself: Very good, as expected.

The only negative was the lack of warning about the Windows 11 configuration glitch. We spent a slightly anxious hour trying to go around the bug which caused windows 11 to freeze at the ""enter a pin code"" step. Checking on the internet, it seems a common fault, some warning and guidance would have been appreciated."

After over a week of hearing nothing I’m given a follow up email that the phone has been deemed “not working” due to screen burn and was REDUCED TO £85. I personally have looked after this phone like it was made of diamonds. Original protective plastic was still attached when I sent it in and have a plethora of photos confirming the condition of the device.

I am yet to receive my device back as of this review and I expect to have to go Karen-mode on them for a second time to have it returned.

Avoid like the plague, genuinely criminal practices taking place.


Update:
Ignore the response I have received to this reply. The support channels lied to me 3 times about receiving tracking numbers for the return postage. I will update this review once the device has returned and I can inspect it."

Firstly, their forum is incredibly helpful when it comes to putting together a PC that suits your needs and budget. The members are not PCS staff, just helpful fellow customers so there is no pressure or upselling.
The ordering system is very clear and easy to use, and the progress of my order was updated daily.
The PC was very well packaged when delivered and comes complete with a ""Welcome Booklet"" (50 pages) that goes through setting up, common problems and loads of useful information very clearly.

Connection issue keeps being 'escalated' with same results each time. Have been told that I can continue or cancel the contract and return everything - no compensation or appreciation of the time I have wasted and the stress that this has caused me.

Was advised to move my daughter's SIM so that she could be on the same account as I am on, with ALL the benefits of my account applied to her. This of course didn't happen and for the last two (yes, 2) months, nobody has dealt with this. Each time I call, I am told someone else is dealing with it, so no-one else can do anything about it. 2 months and an organisation the size of BT, shows incompetence and ineptitude of a scale that beggars belief. Avoid this organisation like a plague. It's absolutely useless and inept.

Her drivers hadn't kept her informed and have turned their phones off. Been told to ring them back again for the third time. Why didn't someone just call this morning to rearrange? Rang and spoke to Ben Rhodes and requested my call be escalated straight away but Managers do not take calls?! Left my number for a Manager to call.

I placed the order which was confirmed and then 2 days later I was advised that 3 out of the 4 sets of pyjamas were no longer available, but they confirmed that 1 set was. I tried to cancel the order of 1 set of pyjamas and I was told that this was not possible as it was personalised! Studio need to alter their ordering system for items such as this and provide an opportunity to cancel the remaining order if they cannot fulfil the entire order! I have now ordered from another company which has fulfilled my order of all 4 sets of pyjamas!"

177552,I bought a refurbished phone from QMF at the end of October 2020 for £280 and after waiting for it to arrive for two months I asked for a refund and it has never materialised. I have about 50 emails from them saying they’ll refund me by such and such a date but they were clearly fobbing me off as they’re now not replying to my emails and I understand they’ve done a runner. I contacted the police and they’ve closed the case saying there are no leads to pursue. I can live with losing £280 but what angers me is that they done this to thousands of people and I estimate they’ve made about £3 million as a result. They’re probably in Africa by now in their mansion paid for from this fraud / theft living the high life.
183560,Internet went off the other week didn’t get a text message to tell me it was going off had to ring up to find out what was happening message said L311LU was off until 3pm didn’t come back on until next day didn’t get an apology or compensation for the inconvenience. Not good enough.
195457,"I made an order. It said it wouldn’t come for over two hours so I immediately tried to cancel. I was then forced to stay awake for two hours for it to arrive, and was told I could dispute it and ask for compensation once a driver arrived - even an hour and a half into the order, a driver had still not been found, but I was still told I could not cancel the order because the restaurant had supposedly started preparing it. When it finally arrived, after I told them I did not want it for over two hours, they refused to refund it, saying it had been prepared. So either, they are happy to deliver old food, or they lie about the restaurant's preparation times. I have since deleted my account as they refused to cancel or provide compensation."

154363,"I picked an upgrade with an early cancellation fee of £150, the questions asked for my existing phone....does it switch on and off......are there any scratches to the screen.....I proceeded with my upgrade and credit checks were carried out.

This morning I received an email to say my new phone was on the way and asked me to click on a link to carry out checks on my trade in. One of the first questions was....is there any shadowing on your phone....the checks were carried out on a white screen and I could see a very faint shadow so I clicked yes. Now my phone doesn't pass the checks and my upgrade is a whoping £40 a month more.......

So vodaphone have been extremely unhelpful, surely the checks should have been done before hand and they should have asked about shadows before allowing me to proceed with an order or credit checks......

The mark in miniscule....I only noticed as the check was done on a white screen and my phone is always set to a dark background. An absolute con to offer a phone with appealing discounts then making it completely unaffordable when the discounts are removed.

Needless to say my phone has no scratches and functions perfectly hence I went ahead with the order!

Don't be fooled by alluring discounts with trade in's, expect further checks once your phone arrives and the removal of any discounts for stuff that should have been mentioned before purchase.

Needless to say my phone will be returned and my contract with vodaphone terminated at the first opportunity, poor customer service and a rather back to front method of carrying out trade in's, its a ploy yo get u stay with them....lesson learned for me! Goodbye vodaphone"

I paid the deposit against the trade in price as requested and added the remainder to my creation account. When I went to collect the watch they said I was only due £70 refund. Then they changed the price of the trade in from £107, to £70, to £105 to £25 all at the time of collection this reduced the value of the trade in price by £82. As I had paid the deposit and arranged the remaining payment on my creation account as far as I was concerned the watch was purchased and I was just collecting the new watch. I shook my head in disbelief and the salesperson was very rude telling me I wasn’t listening to him. Needless to say I walked away and left the shop in disgust."

Have ordered the same item for the same price from a different online retailer yesterday and it’s already with the courier to be delivered tomorrow.

If you do risk placing an order with these muppets just note that the item you order isn’t actually in stock and ready to be sent. In the last correspondence I had on Sept 2nd the item I had ordered on July 31st was still in the ‘testing’ phase.

A refund estimate of 14 days has already come with a disclaimer that due to Covid there may be delays. How hard it can be to transfer money from their bank account to mine is a mystery to me. When I paid them they seemed to receive it pretty instantaneously. Absolute joke."

I chose the click & collect service as I am at work all day and nobody will be at home to pick it up as I live alone. N.B. Money had been taken from my account for a pending transaction.

No updates at all until I called them on Tuesday 30th. They told me they were supposed to ask me some security questions and forgot to. They still don't confirm my order.

I wake up on the 31st with an email asking me why I chose click & collect. I responded saying it's because I am at work and I choose collect for everything, including groceries and amazon. They don't answer for hours so I call them and they tell me ""we will send you a confirmation later today"". A few hours later they send me an email asking me for a copy of my passport and a utility bill from no more than two months ago.

I ask them why they would ever need this instead of just sending me the product I paid for and the customer service just tells me ""I cannot advise on that"". I receive no further explanations, in the meantime they inactivated my account.

I never got my GPU, and I had to ask for them to cancel the order."

If your net connection is OK then they're passable, but 99 times out of 100 it's not. You then call up their support line and get fobbed off to 20 different countries where you can tell the ""support"" agent is basically reading a script and not listening to a word being said.

In addition to this I was signed up to packages I did not request and deals were not honoured. And it was only after showing them I was serious and starting small claims procedures against them that I was given the money back that I should never have been charged in the first place.

Being told ""you don't have the experience to understand the issues"" was a new one for me, especially as someone who has had almost 2 decades in the IT industry in some form or another.

180243,"We have been with talk talk for almost 2 years. We got off to a bad start when we didn't go live the day we were supposed to and had no internet for almost 2 weeks. Talk talk were useless in sorting this out and tried blaming BT. They then tried to pawn us off with a pitiful amount of compensation even though the ombudsman clearly sets out what people are due for no internet when it is the companies fault.
When our contract ended I contemplated staying with talk talk because I was concerned they would mess up the change over and we'd be without internet again, however, after another engineer appointment was missed I decided to bite the bullet and move.
The move happened and talk talk should have automatically cancelled our account, however, given their incompetence so far I decided it was best to call them and make them aware.
Here we are almost 3 months on and I'm now getting emails from Home Telecom saying that I'm being moved from talk talk to them. So I've contacted talk talk to find out that they didn't cancel the account (albeit they haven't taken a monthly payment for 2 months). After spending half an hour on the phone going through the cancellation terms again conditions they hung up.
I will never use them again.

144125,"The worst customer experience for 2 order within one day! I made two orders today. The first order is ridiculous. This rider didn't deliver my food to my front door and asked me to walk around to find him. And he was hiding behind the building which had no access to any door. He is at the wrong location and fails to deliver the food. I then requested a refund as the customer service team cannot provide me with any. First of all, it is not my problem that he's at the wrong location and I put in effort looking for him for 10 minutes. At last, when I finally located him, he saw me literally and talked to me that ""my waiting time is up."" and took away my food for himself, did not leave me with anything and then left. I paid over 30 GBP and get no food but with a terrible experience, get disrespected and also waste a bunch of time communicating with the CS team.
The second order is terrible as well. The driver get lost and I was downstair waiting for him for 1 hour. Within the one hour, he kept calling me and wanted to fool me that he has arrived. I then insisted he has to come to my area to deliver the food, not a thousand miles far away and asked me to find him. Then he admitted he was lost and used one hour to find me. During the waiting time, I contacted the customer service and requested for cancellation of the order but they not allow me again. My food get all cold when arrived."

I am old and I am ill, but I'm not stupid. I have been fobbed off repeatedly and given contradictory statements, statements that make no sense, I have done so many online chats that I've lost count. All those online agents are extremely polite, and very apologetic but I believe they are as much in the dark as I am. I have spoken on the phone to the orders department and finally the complaints department. They apologise and sympathize but I was on the point of a breakdown before some actual information was finally given to me by a frosty person in the complaints department. I was finally told I have a robotic something or other on my line, whatever that might mean. No explanation as usual. My son is very upset about anybody treating me like this. He managed to do an online chat via Facebook and was told my case would be ""escalated""...unfortunately I have been promised that 4 or 5 times already. I would not recommend Talktalk to anybody. Yes the online chat agents are polite and I think are trying to help but they all give contradictory ""information"" and I honestly think they are just placating me as all their information is different. If I could turn back the clock I would choose another firm for sure."
147719,"If there were 0 stars that I could give this company then I would.

They have THE WORST Customer service ever!

They have continued to bill me despite being out of contract and being told I would be credited on my final bill. They make it almost impossible to leave without incurring fees and charges. I tried to give over 30 days notice... was told I have to ring back on precisely 30 days before the expiration. They generate a PAC code which expires n 28 days and tell me to use it on 28th of the month (end of contract was 30th) for the smallest 'early exit fee'. I go to use the code on 28th as advised... but it doesn't work and apparently takes 24hrs before they can generate a new one. Subsequently by the time this now changes over I am into the next bill month so I get charged another months bill! I call up to explain I tried to use the Pac code and I feel this is unreasonable to which they say 'well it expires at precisely 28 days to the second after it was sent...'. Not helpful to know after the event. The advisor continued to be rude, arrogant and tell me I should have used it earlier and not tried to 'save a pound by waiting until 28th'.

Quality of HD on the Premium package (that is 1080p) is very poor.... shimmering, artefacts, flicker etc. TBH this is typical of badly upscaled 1080i material, and makes me wonder just how much is in genuine full 1080p resolution.

Not impressed.

Best thing about it, is when you switch to any other device, like a Fire Cube, or just the apps on your smart TV. The massive increase in HD quality is immediately noticeable, and the speed of the interface is off the scale in comparison. I liken the NowTV experience to ""dial up internet"", compared to superfast fibre!

Conclusion: if you really want appreciate just how good your nVidia Shield, Firestick or Firecube really is... just spend an hour or so with the Now TV stick !"

113239,"Nowtv may well be the worst steaming service I’ve had the displeasure of using. Not only is it overpriced, the fact that in 2022 it doesn’t offer user profiles blows my mind. Disney has only had an app for a couple of years and got it right straight away why do Now struggle so much? The fact that they expect you to pay an extra £5 per month to watch ad free only for it to still show 30 second adverts is really infuriating. I will give everyone a tip though who still wishes to use the service. If you download whatever you plan to watch you won’t see ads so you can save yourself £5. Also why is it the only service that requires you to turn on your location services when not connected to WiFi? Ridiculous."

123318,"Good product, good value and efficient service."
149945,"I’ve been with Now TV for several years. During that time the quality of service has gone from good to poor. It used to be easy to contact customer services, but it is now impossible to get to speak to a person. For problems, you are referred to their website, which then traps you in a loop of web pages that provide info that isn’t useful. Broadband quality is inconsistent and rarely good. I can no longer find a reason to recommend this service to anybody."
188644,Could not believe how fast it was delivered.
163361,"My complaint on Teamknowhow was initially responded to by what appears to be their complaints dept 'Letusknow'.
After protracted back and forth explaining the situation I eventually agreed on a solution with them over a month ago.
Only for them, subsequent to agreeing to this solution, to cease all contact, not honour the agreement, and go back to the Teamknowhow default customer response of totally ignoring the customer."

My only moaner - is the price that BT & others are putting price every year and in BT case difficult to find Option to find ""Fix the Fault Progress"" and for some reason the Chat to BT Button / Dialogue is not working (on all of my devices - even with Popup Enabled)

Again good Service From BT & Openreach (Connected Company) - considering NEw Year week and likely hood of staff being ill - covid, flu, etc."

I no longer respond to leads that are planning and researching, I possibly will hire or anything over 5 credits. Bark NEEDS to tell customers that the companies pay for the leads. I feel they should refund at least part of it when the customer doesn't respond.

They also need to fix their zoning I work in one council area just because part of another on is within 20 miles does not mean I cover it"
109018,"The service from Plugin Boutique was great, however the product I purchased has proven difficult to set up and the instructions supplied by the product developers are not thorough or particularly clear. Perhaps if Plugin Boutique could provide a simple ""Idiot's guide"" to download and setup each product this would be very useful as those from the product developers can often assume that the buyers are techno 'boffins'. I should say that I am a retired IT professional and this is true of many software developers - the software is great but the manual writers need to address their wider audience."

I informed BT that I was moving house and explained it was impossible for me to take my BT package over to my new house due to my partner already having it at her house that I was moving into. They basically said it's not there problem and I still got charged an ""early cancellation"" fee which I think was very harsh as like I said above, there wasn't a scenario for me to take it with me. Money grabbing company who care more about profit than ""the customers may always be right"". Think they need to sort out how to treat people fairly and look at some new T&C's to be installed in there already ""screw the customer"" ones. I informed them I will never use there services again and will also not be renewing my partners BT once the contract is over. Yet again they didn't seem to care about losing ""2 cusotmers"" prob beacaue they've got enough money in the bank. AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID"

I asked on 16 Jan for something to return my old box, something was supposed to arrive within 10 days. Nothing. Trying to contact them on whatsapp been waiting an hour for someone to connect to me. ITS A JOKE."
188680,"I have had numerous issues with three mobile. Pretty much since day one. The latest saga. I sent a phone back within the 14 day cooling off period and requested that the account was to be closed rather than a replacement. The box wasn't even open so there shouldn't have been any issues. 6 weeks later and 17 phone calls later I am still waiting for my £90 upfront cost. I have been promised on three occasions that it was initiated and would be in my bank account 3-5 working days later. That came and went. Another call another promise . This happened 3 times. They even took the certain numbers from my visa so I was confident it was being done. Anyway I got so fed up I made an official complaint. I was told that NO refund had ever been initiated. So I was lied too! I was then told I'd have to wait for the final bill. So I had the final bill which actually reflected the monthly cost of the device! It was as if my account hadn't even been closed. So on the phone again. My account was now showing as restricted which reflects ony credit file as a default!!!!! They said they'd sort that. Yet a week later still the same. Iv now threatened legal advice , that didn't bother them. So I said I would cancel my DD for my other 2 phones until they paid or took me to court. As it is I'm legally entitled to do this. Although I'm sure this would be detrimental to my credit file. Anyway I have now been promised the upfront cost would be initiated and with me in the next few working days. Let's see!
This isn't the first time I have had the same issue with three. I pay for a lot of phones for the family so in the past Iv sent several back , always in the same condition as I recieved them and in most cases not even open. It seems to me they really don't like this and go out of their way to mess you around. There agents lie to you as shown above. They make promises they have no intention of keeping. Iv used all the other UK phone providers and sent devices back and never have I had these issues. I'd go far to say that three are one of if not the worst company I have ever used. Their customer service is dreadful with agents prepared to lie and mislead you. All they want to do is tell you what you want to hear and get rid of you. Be warned folks. Use other providers."
186895,"Why should I be expected to be 'helpful, constructive and honest' when the first line of a letter from Virgin Media sates 'We have been trying to get in touch' when in fact they have not been trying to get in touch!

163641,"Absolutely abominable the whole way through.
Bought a laptop from them in 2016, joined the merchant navy in 2018 and needed the screen repaired before the start of the work year. Give it in mid August, didn't see it again. They either lost it or couldn't figure out how to do a screen so, after chasing them for a month and a half, went in and only managed to get a replacement after an hour long explanation session which involved lots of rehashing.

This took place in the Glasgow store which has since shut down, 5 years of paying for insurance on and I take it in to replace a key that's fallen off. They update the software without asking which absolutely tanks performance, 2 months later the same key falls off again and need to take it in for repair again. 2 months later lose a key and the it keeps crashing, they replace the screen and key and try to update the software again after I tell them explicitly not to.
Keeps crashing, rake it in one last time, they don't fix the crashing again, I call them and tell them it's a software issue and they say basic warranty doesn't cover it, and I need to pay for insurance. I have been for 5 years and they say they have no record of it. They send my laptop back to the wrong store, unrepaired for what would be a simple reset. The shop they are sending it back to is closing so they can't replace it, there, I need to trapes an hour out of my way to the next shop which it should've been sent to anyway.
disgusted with this company regularly messing up and doing nothing to about it. Avoid them if at all possible, as soon as I can I'm getting out of their system because they have done nothing but screw me over at every corner."
171401,The product was ordered online and took 10 days to deliver when it clearly stated 3-7 days on the ghd website. Extremely disappointing when this was a birthday gift that arrived late forcing me to spend more money than I intended so my wife could have something to open on her big day. The product itself is more than adequate.

150363,"June 2022:
The Vodafone network has been down in postcode SK13 5DP for nearly 3 weeks. I received a text saying maintenance complete but the Vodafone network is still down in this area. There have been problems for 3 weeks now and no one at Vodafone seems to know what the problem is or when it will be fixed. Even their website shows the network is down. This is a rural area and people rely on their phones to keep in touch. Total shambles.
July 17th 2022:
After some investigation I have discovered that at the end of June 2022 Vodafone upgraded my local mast as part of maintenance program in preparation for 5G. The upgrade failed and the mast shutdown. My device then connected to another mast further away greatly reducing my service (2 bars from 5 bars). The Vodafone website stated there was a fault for a few days and then said service was back to normal which it wasn't. After a coupe of weeks my service has improved and I am getting excellent down /upload speeds so it seems to have been fixed. Vodafone clearly had a problem and I just wish they would have been honest. Their contact centre and the TOBI app just lied to me or disconnected me when I tried to investigate the problem. Vodafone have provided me with good mobile service over the years but they really need to improve their contact centers who do not seem to have a clue when their is a major network outage.I have increased my rating as I am now getting excellent speeds. People on the Vodafone Forum were very helpful."

The dryer was competitively priced and the whole purchase experience was stress free with plenty of clear communications. I opted for the delivery only, which was free. The driver and his colleague were polite and helpful. I had laid dust cloths on the floor, and they were happy to trolley the appliance into the utility room. The day before I was given a 2 hour delivery slot early in morning. While the delivery was late by an hour, I was pleased to receive two ETA update messages during the slot even though the revised times were missed! Gave me confidence that the appliance was on the way. Overall, a positive experience. Marks Electrical will be the first retailer I check when I need a new appliance."

131792,"See previous reviews for context.

Been waiting for Broadband installation since August 20th. It still hasn't been installed. What has been done? They've put a new socket on the wall, 10 minutes work.

I'm losing count of the number of Engineer and missed Engineer visits , broken promises, sorrys and people I've spoken to. I've had 3 or 4 messages of ""We'd like the chance to put this right"". How many chances do you need / want?

I've had 2 cast iron guarantees that it would be installed in the last 2 weeks and still it hasn't.

I was given an installation date of 3rd November that on discussions with BT they stated that that's just not right. It won't even be done by the 3rd now.

Openreach is blamed, BT Enterprise are powerless to do anything.

I've escalated it to executive complaints, still not installed.

The latest? They can't get to the cables as they're buried under Concrete. If they came around the 20th September when I ordered, it wouldn't be a problem.

I've lost circa £1000 due to this debacle and they've credited my account £51. Money first, right BT?

I had to travel by bus last week with bone spurs in my back, a 13 hour day, Monday to Friday, they promised I wouldn't have to and my Broadband would be installed.

It wasn't, it was agony and I had to work ridiculously hard to save my job. None of this sinks in with the people I communicate with, I just get endless apologies. Action speaks louder than words. noone cares about the affects this is having on my health.

But they just don't care. They don't care about the people most in need. Read the replies to their old people promotion on their Twitter page to see how they treat old people and disabled people. They push you onto DM's under the guise of GDPR but they just don't want negative publicity.

That's the only thing they seem to be good at, endless promotion.

They continue to push people onto Twitter and Facebook DM's so they can stay out of view (that's the truth, they don't want it visible).

You're a communications company, why aren't you calling them?

All they care about is £££. All you get is sorries, placation and copy and paste replies. Someone at BT needs to look into Whistleblowers protection. Someone needs to blow this wide open, particularly if you genuinely care about BT's customers

Noone takes responsibility or ownership, they just pass the buck. I've spoken to a few well meaning people who are powerless.

I won't go on Twitter, I'm just counting down the 7 days until I can report BT to the Omdudsman. If that doesn't get anywhere, I'll consider legal action. I've asked twice for a deadlock letter, Still haven't received one.

A billion Pound company should be able to install Broadband to 1 residential property but they're too inept to do it.

Sadly it seems beyond them.

BT's Slogan ""We connect for good"" on Twitter is frankly meaningless and a case of perverted humour at this point in time.

Blaming Openreach when they're a BT owned company is beyond dumb. If you can't get them to act, who can?

Potential Customers, You have been warned, avoid them at all costs."

Sent my gear for trade-in and once examined they upped the price from the original quote because of its condition. Credit paid onto my account very quickly. I then bought a second hand item which now received is almost in perfect condition.

133149,"At the end of last year my TV was faulty so it was sent away for repair it took almost two weeks to fix, Shortly after it was repaired it became faulty again and it was sent back for repair in early March it was returned after five days with a smashed screen so it was recollected and repaired.the following week another fault appeared so once again it was returned for repair. We received a message it would be returned on a Saturday morning,A TV arrived but it was not mine after making a few phone calls it eventually arrived back the following Wednesday of course it had a smashed screen,so off it went back for repair It is now fifteen days and counting since I last saw my TV. When I ring the call centre I am constantly told it will my complaint will be escalated and someone will contact me but that never happens. I have not been able to watch my TV for over a month with the amount of time it has been away.I pay for Sky services which I am unable to watch.
I would really like to shout at someone from Team Knowhow but it would not be fair on the people who take my calls as it is not there fault,I am sure they pass on the information to more senior colleagues so they can look at it and totally ignore it(typical management style)
I suppose shortly I will get a text saying it will be returned on Saturday which will be it's 3 week anniversary so off to the shops now to buy some anniversary cards not sure if I should tempt fate and get a 3rd anniversary card though."

I got a call from Teamknowhow saying the damage isn’t covered by my warranty and I’ll have to pay. How is it that a perfectly normally functioning laptop can suddenly have a broken screen and a water damaged keyboard either the man in the shop didn’t do a proper look or Team Know how accidentally broke it or it broke in transit and they’re just wanting my money
169977,"Oh the joys,

Moved from London and had my WI Fi with HYPEROPTIC and they were amazing and efficient, one day and had WI Fi,

Now in Torquay, no option but had to go with BT, it’s like being in the 60’s, was told on the phone that it would take 2 days for router etc etc, now just found out I have to wait 3 weeks ??

Talk about living in the dark ages,

Really not impressed,,

Saying that after reading all these reviews, it seems I’m not alone,

BT need to get into the 21st Century,,

Or end up like Marks and Spencer’s, on there way out,

BT as mentioned stuck in a time warp , plus holding people to 24 months contract another good reason not to go with them . Lesson learned .. never again"
117711,"My laptop charger was faulty but I was told Apple insist on the laptop being sent also. After 10 days without it I collected my laptop which had been wiped and fault repaired, but same charger and not working when I got home. I rang team knowhow and they said their technicians had used my charger and it worked fine, which would be hard as there is no electricity getting through and light is off. I now have to send the whole lot off again for another week in spite of the fact that the laptop has already been checked. They say it is Apple protocol. I have paid nearly £360 for this service but I would not recommend it to anyone. If and when it comes back next time I will have to reinstall everything not to mention the wasted time and petrol going back to the shop."
189648,"Sold two iPhone 12 Pro's (one normal, one max) in advance of upgrading to iPhone 14.

Got a good price and the sale process was very smooth until receiving a highly reduced offer for minor damage to a fully working phone in very good condition (reduced from £555 to £138.75).

Now the device has to be returned and resold and Envirofone could provide no explanation as to how the revised price had been concluded other than that the representative on the phone agreed it seemed excessive.

Unfortunately won't use again and would not recommend for lack of transparency as well as the fact that it feels Envirofone is trying to exploit customers with very poor revised prices (which auto accept after three days)."

Efficient.. Good system.. product quality/grade as described.. ease of purchase.. ease of refund (48 hours or in-store purchase, 10+ days for online order.. assuming return is same condition as purchased).
Helpful staff. They know the technology.
This said, I’d like to see grading of screen scratches: eg. Superficial; short non-superficial; longer/multiple non-superficial.
Apple screen replacement is expensive.. superficial is fine, deeper may represent higher risk of screen cracking."
113874,"HIGHLY recommend to STAY AWAY from this abysmal platform - it is a miracle how they still haven't been ordered to cease operating by a court. Just now, yet another establishment that does not deliver the ordered items as specified (2nd time within a week). Deliveroo's response? After talking to a customer support rep AND a customer support manager: ""We'll take your feedback onboard but can't offer you a refund"".

Restaurants/establishments on Deliveroo are essentially allowed to do whatever they like, and as of about a month ago, Deliveroo seems to have taken a new approach where they just shrug it off by having customer support employees read out the same scripts like mindless drones, and then do absolutely NOTHING about it, while it's the establishment (!) who is at fault here.

The way Deliveroo has been conducting themselves seems to very much border on malpractice; ironically, they've lost in court before: ladbible[dot]com/news/woman-wins-payout-after-deliveroo-court-case-20220711.

Cannot recommend enough to stay away from Deliveroo - it's like playing Russian roulette with your order, wondering what the restaurant/establishment will get wrong THIS time. Deliveroo ought to get sued into the ground for operating like this for years."

their delivery drivers are saying no o deliver a fridge up 6 steps! so they put z fridge in a van for delivery and expect all purchases of American fridges to live in a house with no stairs. teamknowhow setup and support is unprofessional. I order an American fridge and the driver said it is too big too carry up 6 steps or downt 6 steps. i paid specifically extra for installation and removal. i rang them to say what kind of company sends people with American fridges to deliver and not expect any steps. they basically pointed me to their t and c about what I signed up to. I told them why have a specialist delivery company that is not able to take a fridge up 6 steps?. the person then just ignored my comments and pushed my call through to complaints where i waited for 20minutes with no answer. they did not even take my order number. they just left me on my own as a customer and telling me my fridge will be left out on the front. i had already waited 4 weeks for delivery.. their own driver also said nobody cares to ask any details and we just deliver what we can. currys and teamknowhow are completely disconnected.
Do not purchase from currys as they know about teamknowhow and choose to continue with such a bad company and do not purchase from any company that chooses them as it only shows they only care about selling not delivery the product or a acceptable service. I have to elderly people, a life essential of a fridge and they send no one with delivery skills for large objects. crazy company. they just a mini cab service for products. no specialty in anything."

They had told me I could trade in my phone to pay off my contract and get in upgrade and new tariff. The phone they sent wasn't the one I sent. A refurbished one was sent back to me and a trade in price is £18.75.
I have raised a complaint that is taking ages and you can not contact the store or anyone to help when they should replace the phone with a new phone as I'm paying for that in contact!

Due to shortages I had to wait a very long time for delivery - The problem is that you have to chase them up to get an honest & realistic delivery date, as the automated responses just fob you off.

My phone report stated no problems but the USB charger port and this reduced the trade in deal from £260 to £80. A piece that they deny they can't just replace and its brand new and then charge me for those services which I researched properly cost them £20. Becareful as the lady at customer services couldn't even count too 14 as I was annoyed and wanted to return my new phone, I was within my 14 day cool off period. After I taught her how to count I finally got the result I wanted but to be honest I can't be bothered with the trouble of returns and having to wait for the provider to switch back to my old contract.
Conclusion: Shady business and with NO absolutely NO REGARD of customers. I have learnt my lesson thr hard way and WILL NEVER do business with them again.
They will not provide 90% of customers with the trade in value they first offer and the revised offer will be a slap in the face."

One week later they say they need a photo of me HOLDING the licence too. They said refund is processed. One week later, no refund, I call and there’s more security issues. They said “Refund is processed and will appear in 3 days.” One week later and I have yet to receive a refund. I call and low and behold they said “There’s some security issues before we can do the refund.”

165393,"Honestly I’m disappointed, I have been with Vodafone for around 11 years now and I think today is the straw that broke the camels back.

This isn’t to say the last 11 years have been perfect, I have had issues a plenty in that time from money being taken long before my bill date and all round “customer service” fiascos.
However eventually things have always been resolved and I have stuck it out.

Until today. I spoke with customer support today after receiving a message that my bill will be going up to nearly £150 a month for my phone and tablet.
Turned out that there was 15% discount applied when I added the table to my account and I was unaware that it was ending.

After suffering the ordeal of navigating the automated systems I did speak with a gentleman who understood my frustrations as I explained that my partner has a better model of both the phone and tablet and only pays a little over half way my bill is due to rise to for both.

He popped me on hold to speak to another colleague from a different department as I explained that I may have to consider my options and look at closing the account.
When he came back he assured me his colleague Clara would be able to help resolve the issue for me and transferred me over.

This is when the problems began.

My call with Clara lasted no more than 6 minutes, she had no willingness to help and quite frankly her attitude was absolutely disgusting.
Working in retail myself I understand having a bad day and I know what it can be like to handle customers who aren’t happy, so it’s safe to say I was being quite understanding but the tone she spoke to me in was utterly degrading and the absolute tip of the iceberg was what she started to mutter, scoff and snigger with people around her as if I couldn’t hear her.

Now I’m stuck having to either pay out over £200 to upgrade to a cheaper contract or £600 to close my account altogether. I suppose that makes me the mug in this whole situation.

In of itself this wouldn’t be the end of the world if not for the way in which I was treated today, I know I’m just one person and a company as big as Vodafone aren’t really going to care if I stay or go but someone needs to take note that it’s situations like this that push people away altogether. If I missed a time limit on multi plan discount in the contract then happy to admit that’s on me and it’s a case of “suck it up” but by allowing your staff to speak with people as they are doing is incredibly disrespectful to your customers and fully explains the 1.3 star rating.

It’s safe to say I wouldn’t recommend Vodafone."
178985,PCS kept me informed of every stsage of the build of my laptop and its shipping.

163470,"Long story short: PC curry advertised high-end specs laptop - unable to deliver and unable to replace. Just hold my money for almost a month.

Long story:

16 December, I purchased a laptop with tech spec - i7 RTX 3080 16GB Vram.

The laptop arrived in a reasonable time. However, there was RTX 3080 8GB Vram.

I asked to exchange my laptop for an item aligned with the spec mentioned on the web page. Due to misleading instructions received via email, I called them many times, costing me a fortune on phone bills.

After PC-Curry deleted the web page for the advertised laptop, they proposed to choose an exchange laptop in the price range of +10% based on what I paid.

I complied with this rule. Surely enough, PC Curry cancelled this delivery also. PC Curry said the reason for the cancellation was ""the laptop was unavailable for delivery"" - while the web page was available to purchase online.

The laptop was available to purchase and available to deliver within two working days for delivery via web page and via phone call. availability was validated by staff in the store and on sales channels online.

Mistakes happen every day, but the way you handle them determines who you are.

Happy end: This situation forced me to find a different hardware provider. Also, I saved a big pile of money with a more reliable PC-selling company.

Think twice before purchasing anything online with PC-Curry.


Update: I wrote an email to contactsocial[at]currys.co.uk with more details. I am not expecting anything, but I hope somebody else will not experience the same scenario in the future."

I've posted many times on their Facebook page, got I reply again asking for further information so they could sort the repair, again this was over 10 days ago. I know we are currently in unprecedented times but come on Currys 20 days and you still cant sort a washer repair out yet you still take my direct debit every month!!!

122207,"Absolute con. I sent my phone off after getting a quote and they came back to offer a reduced price due to scratches (£430 down to £365). Now I know you might read this, as I would, and think yeh yeh there must be scratches. I can say categorically that there are none and I took a video and photos of my phone before sending it. From purchase the phone had been in a high quality case and with an expensive screen protector. They don’t send photos of the scratches to evidence their decision .. why? Because the scratches don’t exist. They are at it! UPDATE: Mazuma returned my phone. It is still in pristine condition. They asked below for my order details to look into this and haven’t come back to me. I wonder why! FURTHER UPDATE: I sent my phone to We Buy Any Phone and after checking over my phone they are paying me £467 for it, only knocking off £15 due to the battery being at 85% efficiency. Even the slight reduction is much higher than Mazuma’s original offer before they knocked it down. In future I’ll use We Buy Any Phone every time."

I was telling my neighbour and she was appalled at how dreadful their customer service is and I said to her it states on their contract we put our customers first.

If anyone in Fauldhouse is reading this give Virgin Media a miss and look elsewhere I never though any other provider could be as bad as TalkTalk now you know, you only need to read the reviews on here to realize that you’ll be signing up to a bad experience, I’m glad I left before they installed I’ve saved myself 18month of grief."
179640,"Ignore the bad reviews,

So my experience with pc specialist is different to say the least, despite all the odds against my pc they pulled through,

So got this pc off my friend and happily transferred the warranty,

The only thing I didn’t like was having to pay £16.20 for a box to send back the pc in but no matter because they collected it anyway without charging me the £35.00

So no complaints there, Id say my biggest battle was explaining my issues building pcs myself I know how tricky they can be to deal with, and despite the pc passing all the stress tests, for 3 days they still approved my request for a motherboard upgrade,

To give this PC a fighting chance for gaming in 2022,

So the very kind head engineer said speak to the team and paid for my new motherboard on the phone without a hitch, I must say I’m very pleased with the outcome,

And from what I’ve been told they will even see what SSD mounts/screws they can find for the old motherboard in the warehouse so it can be used again.

In my book that’s recycling at it’s finest.

And even had a graphics card in it without warranty as the previous owner of that wasn’t available they still contacted msi on my behalf, and just made solid suggestions,

A big thanks to Liam today aswell in customer services who sorted my upgrade from the stock,

Now I have a PC that will be perfect for 1080p gaming with future upgradeability,

Yea I’m slightly upset they couldn’t find my issue but as per there policy they have to replicate all issues, now I know this pc has labour warranty left and will do for the next 2 years at least.

now that is a happy customer even if I did have to pay for my needed upgrade."
181543,The content available is good however expensive as you have to buy passes for movies/tv etc. The now tv website online is terrible. Logs you out mid episode and hard to manoeuvre.

172185,"I enrolled for a broadband with shell on 26/11/2022. I have had a series of more than 5 engineer home visits booked and only 1 has been attended while all the others they don't show up. I have spoken to more than 15 people in all different departments and have been told that my service shows that I am live with them since 14th December that is when I am being charged for, however I am not connected to their server and not receiving internet yet. They have done several trouble shooting and identified 3 problems of which these will require an engineer visit. They can't confirm if the engineers will be available for another few days and I have to wait until they can attend. they are providing tentative appointments but can't guarantee that they will attend on these occasions too. No one has put a clear explanation on my account why the engineer home visits get cancelled.

During a few of my conversations I asked to cancel this because it has cost me a lot of days missing from my work having to wait for the engineers, I have been told by shell that if I cancel I need to pay £307, then another staff said that will go up to £350. They say that although they acknowledge that they have not connected me yet, but because I entered a contract and bought their service, I can cancel or I have to pay £350.
I really don't want to do this anymore. I want some legal assistance. I feel very stressed and emotionally drained from the whole process and shell is not willing to help and not willing to assist with the cancellation of the service without a charged even though I have never received any service.

Can someone please provide me some legal advise and where I can seek justice?"
134273,"Been trying to contact the BT call center now for 5 days, multiple times a day. i simply can't get through. Been with BT for 20+ years. The longer you stay, the more they rip you off. Good deals only for new customers. Stay away if you can"
115431,"They wrote to me saying I'm going to be moved to Digital Voice. They sent a ""Smart Hub 2"". Unfortunately I don't want to use that - my network uses a non-BT router - so I tried to ask them how to use Digital Voice without a BT hub.

First tried phoning. Got forced into a text conversation that's charged for.

Tried online chat. Completely failed to get my question addressed. Whoever I spoke to tried to tell me that there was no ""order open"" for Digital Voice but I had an option to ""upgrade"". Then I got nothing but a hard sell to get me onto a different contract. When I insisted on getting my actual question answered they stopped the conversation.

When the obligatory survey then turned up even that didn't work.

Awful."
124738,It was easy to order and it arrived as was stated.
119803,As usual quick delivery. Easy to order. Very efficient.
146474,"Only giving 1 star because 0 is not an option. I don't usually leave reviews as nearly every service or product these days is rubbish, so I would be constantly writing. But this is beyond a joke. Really, really, really shoddy service. Takes over an hour to get through. Accidently cut off when finally achieving some resolve but didn't call back (even though they took my number).
Back to square 1. Started it all again and Was promised issue was sorted. But it wasn't. Bill should be half what it is but 2 months later still on old tariff. The date on this is my last conversation with them..still waiting. If you can avoid, please DO NOT GIVE YOUR CUSTOM TO BT!
UPDATE 21 NOV '22. Called BT again today after being promised last week that it would be sorted out in 24 hours. Today they claimed they had no knowledge of my order and I would have to start again. Finally given up and cancelled. AVOID BT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!"
198962,"Ordered lens at 5.15pm and arrived at 9.20 am next morning. Could not have been quicker, (brilliant)"
188302,"Useless.
I switched from Plusnet which was bad enough.....
I had no idea there were worse providers out there.
They have NO customer service whatsoever. They only get back to you if you contact them via the complaint option.
ATM I'm ""fighting"" with them over a renewal/upgrade of my current contract. I want to renew the contract online. Nope, not possible. I have to force myself through a call centre session where they'll probably try to sell more than I want, including fridge freezers and luxury mattresses....
I'll simply look for a new provider. After a month of trying to contact them, well, I could have spent the time upgrading and working rather than waiting for a response or sensible offer.
Why such comtempt for existing customers?"
153412,"Ordered iPhone 14 on a contract. Went through and added all details and received text later that order was cancelled. After a couple of emails they said website had problem and they took too many orders then the stock available.
If they can’t even get that right how safe is your data with them?"
126683,Had kitchen whitegoods delivered by Gavin and Martin. Awesome people.. Really friendly and so helpful. Kept me up to date with arrival times. Quick efficient.

That’s what I call efficient 👍"

The website also allows you to select the delivery date which is very convenient.

The product turned up on time and was what I ordered."

The second month they said the payment was refused, this turns out to be Now TV used old account details.

149757,"Easy to order. To create and upload. Of good quality.
Would recoment. Delivery was punctual and arrived on time."
194788,"Shocking! I thought I had cancelled my membership 6 months ago. Turns out you have to go through 5 pages of cancellations where they bury the cancel button on different parts of the page, so you think you have cancelled when you actually haven't. Clearly designed to be as deceptive as possible, and I dread to think how many other people have been caught out by this and not bothered to complain. After a very strong worded complaint they have offered me HALF the money back. I cant be bothered to take it further but please do watch out, this is not a company to be trusted."
161820,"Great calendars, fast delivery too."

In the end I cancelled my contract, I was charged £9.99 for connection which didn't happen so had to call for a refund and this week have noticed they too £30 out if my account, ive called and it should be ferunded in 21st December but how dare they take money out and nit refund it till weeks later...this company is a joke. In the meantime I went with BT and connection was successful and no problems since ....avoid Nowtv if you can, its not a great company"
119010,Customer Service was very helpful. New item arrived the next day. All very professional.
192006,The product looks fantastic. I ordered the goods and they arrived next day and were well packed. I will definitely use them again.

142862,"Easy to order, arrived quickly. Excellent"
114680,"Quick delivery, good service. Websites not the easiest to use."
137592,"I won't be using eBuyer again, due to the poor customer experience. The website works, the prices are ok, they answer the phone after a few minutes which is good, but when they label you as a fraudulent transaction it's difficult to get out of them why. They leave you powerless and not sure if your order is placed or not. The more information you provide the worse it gets until they demand documents for you to prove who you are. When the demand is made they actually cancel your order. I think I would prefer for them to just do this in the first place. I sent the documents, passport and a utility bill and they did reverse the cancellation of my order.

I don't want the goods from them now and will use one of the alternatives."
120462,Fast and efficient couldn't be more impressed with the service I received

179259,"Deliveroo has to be one of the worst delivery services around. I ordered a redelivery to my house and for some reason they put in my old address.. although the original address was my current one. So they decided to go with that I then realised, which was apparently too late, even after being in contact with the delivery driver, so all parties were aware of the situation! Not one person I the whole team was willing to help resolve the situation, which for me was the worst part... I was on the phone for a very long time, but regardless of this... ot o e person wanted to help, they only wanted to put the blame on me even though their app (for some reason) put the default address to my old one... I understand mistakes happen, but for this lack of help to resolve the situation and tell me I wasn't entitled to a refund was quite pathetic. I use deliveroo so much, bit when something goes wrong and this is the response I get... makes me very upset and after today I for sure will not be using their services again! Pathetic excuse for a business"
151616,I would not recommend Now tv. I signed up for one month. It kept taking money every month without warning. It is auto renewal. Not good value for money!
100881,"Easily the worst internet provider I've ever had. I've had Sky, Virgin, BT and ALL of them are better than this horrific company.

I've had many issues including: being overcharged, being falsely told I'm getting an upgrade in my area and from them to then ignore my calls to upgrade because of their mistake, my internet keeps cutting out while I'm on work calls from home, the list is pretty long of all the issues. And now when I wish to make a complaint, their online live chat service isn't connecting me. I've tried on 3 separate devices (work laptop, personal laptop and smart phone). It seems so convenient that they give you no options when it comes to making a complaint, but if I were to cancel my direct debit, they would be calling in seconds. What an utter ridiculous company."
146121,"Fast delivery, clear instructions. Would 100% recommend."

109291,Very quick service and product as described. Excellent website also making it easy to see if the correct product is available and will work.
146545,My second order with this company and like the first one the service was fast and accurate. That is rare these days.
133756,"Easy to locate the required part on the web page , fast postage , but should consider the cost of postage one small button could have been posted in a standard envelope.
I would buy from this company again"
114881,"I had a call last week from BT trying to sell me something. However, while they were on I told them I did not think that the volume on my digital handset (yealink, provided by BT) was working very well. The sales person told me to do some things and it started working but she suggested I take a new phone (at no cost to me) and I initially agreed. However, over the next couple of days I decided that my old phone was working fine and did not need a new one. I received conf. of this from BT on the 12th and then again on the 14th July. I then received another BT e-mail telling me the switchover to the new phone would take place on 16 July and the old handset would cease working. I called to cancel the new product and indeed the member of staff made no indication that this would not be possible. Neither did the person on the 12th July and neither did the pre-ceeding e-mails before the 15th and indeed when I complained about this I was told by the person who initially talked me into taking this new phone the 24/48 hours notice was required for cancellations which from time of order to receipt did not give me that option. As I was getting no-where with the incompetent staff who initially was Shirley who sent the new handset, then on 15th to Ellie who (from the same department )cancelled the order telling me she would send out the returns bag for the new handset, again no mention that I could not cancel or needed 24/48 hours notice. Then on the 16th my existing handset went dead so became really annoyed waiting over 25 minutes for BT to answer my call and when they did it was with a really rude guy who cut me off before giving me his name. Had to recall and wait another 20 minutes for an answer and this time was put through to Shirley who was the person who persuaded me to take the new handset and she then advised 24/48 hours notice is required to deal with my issue i.e. to get my existing handset re-instated. Asked her why she never advised that once the order was placed it would be impossible to cancel - she avoided answering that only to ask why I wanted to cancel which was irrelevant. I then demanded the CEO's name and e-mail address all she could provide was his name said there was no e-mail address (which I found after ending the call by google so lies).
Sent a very lengthy e-mail to the CEO Philip Jansen who has not bothered to acknowledge my issue (I mean why bother with a customer who has been loyal to BT for 45 years+). One of his minions called Kirsty Wilson has been in touch saying it is not possible to re-connect my existing handset - no explanation as to why this is and also received an automated message to say the same thing again no explanation as to why this is and finishing with BT has been unable to resolve the situation so BT are now calling the situation due to them not resolving it ""deadlock"" and I can now refer this to the ombudsman quoting the magic BT get out word ""deadlock"".
This is a BT business account and my business has been without a landline since 16 July and as this service is ""the cloud"" my wi-fi and internet conncection is also not working properly as they are all linked. I pay around £280 a month to BT and EE Same Company for my business service which I am currently not receiving. Anyone else experienced anything like this. Not only will I be going to the Ombudsman but I will also take it to the national papers."
154344,"Broken phone and still got what they quoted me for it. If you ensure the condition you select is correct, you should get the money stated. Quick payment too. Will use again as I always use mazuma."
142861,Fantastic sale only thing that stopped me giving 5 stars was a slight lack of communication re my orders progress.. however goods were received well packaged just slightly over a week after purchase at a very bust time of year..
106565,"Item ordered and came within 24 hours, packaged well and a great price with my Blue Light Discount code… I would 100% recommended shopping with Hughes Direct…"

105076,"Cannot give a lower rating but would if possible. Had to order tv stick as a change of tv which had Now tv already loaded meant the new set didn't have it. Use now tv to watch sky sports when I chose.
Ordered stick week ago today (8 days) as needed it for this weekend. Paid and delivery stated 2/3 days on one page and 3/5 working days on another page.
Thought ok as it was Sunday. Well it's Sunday again and still no email informing me it has been despatched and tracking number. In view of their stated delivery time schedule they are now in breach of contract. Contacted them and all they did yesterday was escalate it to a manager who contacted me by email today.
Basically fobbed me off and said wait and see if it arrives tomorrow!!!!!!
He didn't seem concerned that this is unlikely as no despatch email has been issued. Bunch of amateurs who, as stated, are now technically in breach of contract."
199521,Excellent service that was fast and efficient
177622,"I have been a loyal customer for many years but not for any longer. I have come to the conclusion that BT the 2 year contract is a scam!!. The contract allows BT to increase your charges on a whim. I am extremely annoyed. I am now being charged over £70 a month for broadband and anytime calls.
New customers get a better deal than loyal customers. An odd way to reward long standing loyal customers.
When I telephoned them yesterday they offered me the same service for about £45 per month so why have they been overcharging me all his time.
I will be looking for a company who offers me a fixed price ,12 month contract. They are out there, you just have to spend a little time finding them.
I would be very wary of comparison web sites, many of them are paid by the companies they recommend!! Another scam!!"
160757,Ordered two refurbished iPads for my young children.. they turned up so fast and so well packaged and they look brand new no scratches or marks on them!! 100% recommend
135214,"The memory I fancied upgrading my new iMac with, was definitely more money than I ought to have been spending, but, you know, retail therapy and all that! And most of the links when searching for a particular brand, pointed to our Amazonian friends - except one...

Don't think I had heard of Mr. Memory before, but the memory I was after was cheaper, so I had a look... Other than no free returns and the promise of next day delivery (that we've gotten used to with our Prime accounts), the reviews and warranty all looked good, so I took the plunge.

I had problems with passwords when creating an account, so had to phone them... The bloke who answered was friendly, knowledgeable and the sort of salt-of-the-earth type that you could easily chat with all day! Based on this alone, I made the purchase!

And although I chose the free postage option and paid at 3.25 on a December Friday afternoon, my memory dropped onto the mat the next morning!!!! :-))"
169535,"Ordered the item ok, however, the discount was not applied and I had to call up to get it applied"

138043,"I brought a S20 5G and was offered £100 for my S8 and another £100 trade in bonus (£200 total) the S8 was perfect working order, accused it of having screenburn and offered £20 which i rejected and asked for evidence. They sent the phone back 3 weeks later and the phone works perfectly. Never have I seen such poor customer service and lack of communicaiton."

had a phone skin on from new also a protected case never dropped. O2 described it as new condition. But when they recieved it told me it had scratches on it which is untrue I took photos to prove also a video of the phone with th imei on the screen to prove it was in mint condition"
111374,"Why the hell is Shell Energy asking for a review for keeping me on hold then asking some basic suggestions before chucking me into a 'we'll investigate and get back to you' void...? Talk about pushy! I'd prefer not to be put on hold, speak to a person and have my issue resolved on the spot - THEN you can ask for a review...! 🙄"

141172,The spare part that I bought did not work. I had to buy a new tumble dryer.
157637,Just visited.. poor effort made I had to approach the staff member and when I did I didnt really get greeted. Told him my issue and what I had done to try and resolve my issue though what I have found online. He then took my phone still without actually speaking to me. He tried plugging my phone in ( I have water damage issue) he said well the red light has cone on so I told him that was the iris decter light not the charging one (should that me my place to say that). Another member of staff then came in more approachable and tried to help. Outcome is me travelling 20miles from where a live to another store or they could send my phone away. No mention of how long it would take no mention of a replacement phone. So am I meant to just go without a phone?? Poor effort made once my contract runs out I will not be returning. In the meantime I'll just stick with wireless charging!! Poor

111816,Excellent service from Music Magpie - as always (I have purchased several times through them). Webpage was easy to navigate. Good communication throughout the purchase and delivery process. Phone is as described.
121752,Great quality acrylic baubles. Easy to create and lots of different designs to choose from. Will definitely order from them again.
170907,"Why is it so easy to contract with a company like Now for broadband services, yet when the contract ends it becomes an impossible task to find out what is happening with the refund due on termination? There is NO customer service - it's all referred to the Now Community, which provides a free service on behalf of a company that seems to despise its customers."
190491,"The engineer arrived at the time stated. He was very professional and offered excellent advice.
All is now good.
10/10"
112741,"My latest purchase was just some earbuds. Good value and delivered on time. All good as usual.

Cex just seem to have it right.

Pricing is transparent. Great to research (even for other purchases elsewhere) because they still have some prices for things that are out of stock.

I've bought new, I've bought used and all has been good. I bought a used iPad pro quite a few years back and it's still going strong.

Love this company."
114094,"They are an absolute disgrace. The unfortunate side is, the restaurants deserve better. My food left 1hr before they delivered it. It was cold and inedible. I live 2 miles away from the restaurant. Customer service from Deliveroo were shocking.

The sad part is, the restaurant provide amazing food and excellent local cuisine to customers. Any restaurant owners, please think carefully who you give the responsibility to who deliver your orders."
155000,"Today I decided to look at the new Samsung phones released in dundrum. I was in the carphone warehouse shop and I was approached by a very nice man called Christian. He was very friendly, informed about the product and genuine in understanding my needs. Overall my experience was really great and I look forward to dealing with Christian in the future."
133584,its verry Easy way to earn money thats awsome
167465,Good price but delivery is shocking. Still not received my phone and it’s been over a week. Still go no idea when it will be. If it’s not here by Friday I’m gunna cancel my order and go with someone else.
176675,"Once again my order has been lost second year in a row! Ordered this in November to make sure it arrived for Christmas but it has been lost (like last year!). Not sure why I didn’t learn from last year but thought surely losing an order doesn’t happen often. A replacement has been sent but is now due to arrive 28 December so won’t be in time to give as a Christmas gift. Wouldn’t recommend using this company, go with someone else!"
139507,Used to be good signal quality until the introduction of 5g. Now very slow and unacceptable-I’ll be switching in February when contract ends.
196242,"Such poor service, probably one of the worst customer service experience I have received. Took 45 minutes to get through, finally spoke to 3 different people who eventually ordered new phones and confirmed they would arrive last Wednesday, but have still yet to arrive. I doubt they have been ordered. Not impressed."
100735,Purchased a selection of dvds and CDs and was so pleased with my selection. Great prices and as always delivered quickly.

196257,Only problem was I waited a good while for the appointment but everything else was perfect from repair to engineer doing amazing thanks
147534,"Possibly the worst customer support I have ever experienced.

After wasting time going through web chats I then spent a day on and off trying to reach someone by phone. If the line did go through someone would be very slow to get to my issue or would hang up.

Eventually an engineer was sent out (after insisting as their system reported no error with my internet when there was) he left withotu completing the job and with no internet at all!

Back to the phones to spend forever on hold. Still zero indication of my issue being resolved after hours of effort."
139427,"Delivered quickly and very helpful video online. I would suggest that so knowledge of electrics is required, to do a safe job."
177424,"Awful. Contacted customer service twice on the day it was due to arrive and they promised re delivery next day as it Never turned up. Disgusted. Still didn’t turn up when promised it would be the next day. I ordered a basic Nokia phone for around £20. Took my money with no phone ever arriving almost a month ago. I’m disabled so cannot handle contacting customer services repeatedly, I thought twice was sufficient & yet I got no phone delivered to me and no refund. Outrageous."
181363,"Items not delivered today as agreed and paid additional sum for! 2 of the items delivered on Monday which fortunately I was here to receive from Yodel which I have to say regardless of incorrect requested date for delivery kept me updated almost by the minute about expected time of arrival. In contrast I had email from Royal Mail to say ""Craig"" would deliver remaining items today which is what I agreed and paid for. I had checked Royal mail tracking service throughout day which continued to say expected delivery today as agreed. No real updates regarding time of delivery etc by 17.30 so contacted Royal Mail customer services to check details. Informed nothing on system for delivery today and could not explain why my email said otherwise. Went on to say company shouldn't be charging additional costs for specific delivery dates as not guaranteed! Royal Mail customer service also said that items had arrived too late at their depot last night (22.38) to be processed? When asked why I wasn't informed - not usual practice! I feel these companies have no real understanding of time scales, procedures and policies and require much better communication between each other and their customers. There is absolutely no excuse nowadays with technology that the majority of people cannot be updated about agreed dates and deliveries etc. A simple email or text would have been acceptable rather than me wasting a whole day waiting for a delivery that was never going to arrive and now feeling angry at total incompetence and lack of communication from both parties"
174481,An efficient company. Items are good value and we’re easy to put together. Vacuums have very good suction and are lightweight and manoeuvrable.
130184,"I somehow expected good service from BT, HOW WRONG I WAS. We asked for line and broadband and got broadband only, then when they sorted out a new line they lost our old phone number . then we tried to call Australia and these calls were barred . then we tried to make a local call and found out that these calls were not supported and we had to use the area code. then they ordered us new phones to be delivered 7th April no delivery next 11th April no delivery, next the 14th April guess what no delivery and no update to say again when they are not coming. We have been with several providers over the years and Bt are bottom of our list, they make t--k t--k look brilliant. Please do not tell me to talk to the team, i have spent hours talking to them."

112886,"Fast and easy, despatched earlier than expected too"
193865,Excellent service. Couldn’t be more pleased with the service provided by you.
191218,Fantastic service. I had a change of plan with my order and it was sorted efficiently and politely by the helpline staff. The computer itself is brilliant. Well made and just as I wanted. Thanks again.

156130,"I bought a 'no contract' monthly pass for BT Sport to be able to watch a particular match today. I bought the pass well in advance of the kick off time. BT took my money and sent me an email confirmation telling me I should be up and running in 15 minutes. An hour later, I was still not live on my phone's BT Sport App that has worked fine in the past. Missed the match completely and still not live now, four hours after I bought the pass.

Tried to ring BT to complain / get a refund and was greeted by a recorded announcement telling me how committed BT are to excellent service - just to rub salt into the wound. Then I was kept in a queue until I gave up. Their website doesn't currently allow me to cancel the pass and is telling me that money will be taken from my credit card again next month for a renewal of the monthly pass.

All I wanted to do was to watch today's live game. I was sent an email from BT inviting me to buy a pass, so that's what I did - a complete waste of time and money.

BT are currently just a really rubbish company that too many of us have to rely on. As soon as I can, I (like many others, I suspect) will walk away from them."
107111,Both delivery men were very helpful and took their time to make sure everything was ok
182886,Phone didn't come with a charger or any headphones very disappointed as the phone is brilliant just had no charger or any headphones like it was suppose to come with!
170469,Awful customer service. Live chat may as well not exist as they would rather try to sell you a new deal than answer your question. Simply wanted to ensure auto renew was not on after my contract expires and I am still yet to get an answer. Clearly training needed for live chat agents as they are clueless
168330,"I purchased a laptop (costing over £1500.00) less than 2 years ago and the mother board has already failed. As the warranty is only for a year I am told I will have to pay in the order of £750 to repair. What a terrible waste of money. I will never shop here again. This is not fit for purpose and should have lasted longer. I will now explore taking this matter to small claims court as it is not acceptable that such a major part has failed so soon on such an expensive item and the cost to repair if £750.00

UPDATE - JUST TO ADVISE - DO NOT BE FOOLED BY PC SPECIALIST LTD APPARENT RESPONSE - I PROVIDED ALL INFORMATION REQUESTED STRAIGHT AWAY AND THERE HAS BEEN NO RESPONSE OR FURTHER INFORMATION - I STILL HAVE A LAPTOP THAT IS NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE WITH NO SUPPORT SO AM LEFT WITH NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO PURSUE IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT TO TRY TO ENGAGE MY CONSUMER RIGHTS"

Complete scam"
157862,"Genuinely atrocious service! Been suffering with loss of internet periodically for the past five days, I've used the app/SMS to report the fault (as encouraged) which has so far resulted in BT informing me it is fixed, when it isn't. Now when attempting to contact them via phone I'm wasting my time on hold, only to have the call terminated before they even pick up. Wish I could give 0 stars."
103419,"Once a battery is chosen it arrives incredibly quickly and well packaged and Tayna have become my go-to vendor for automotive batteries of all kinds.

However trying to decide between the huge amount of manufacturers (I needed a YTX-14 motorcycle battery) is confusing an I would like to see Tayna guide the consumer into making the best choice.

For the size quoted there are 21 alternatives (excluding lithium options) and I found it hard to choose between them, making me wonder why so many options are stocked/listed."

192690,Helpful telephone info about delivery. Website clarity. Easy online ordering. Very rapid delivery. Good price. What more do you want?
197588,We bought the AirRam to replace our existing Greco vacuum which we have been happy with. This replacement is a total disappointment. When pulling the unit back the rear wheels come off the floor and the front wheels screech. We are hoping that will stop when the hand arm becomes a little worn. As it stands we will not be buying another Gretchen product.

177655,"It took eight days from posting the phone to receiving the payment in my account - this was because of a Royal Mail postal strike, the weekend and Mazuma were very busy due to the iphone 14 launch.

I sold a broken iphone 11 that I was going to throw away, so it was a nice bonus to receive £70 into my bank account.

Overall it was an OK experience, I think it could be improved if customers were told in advance that there is likely to be a delay in processing the order.

I don't know how they compare to other businesses because this is the first time I have used this type of service."

115728,"Can I give 0 stars?!

I signed up for Vodafone broadband when I moved into my flat in May 2021. I was told that it was a 24 month contract but that when it came to moving I could take the box with me and transfer with no problems as long as I let them know in advance.
Ahead of moving flat in October 2022, I ring them in advance to let them know I will be moving and ensure it will be straight forward. I spend 3 HOURS on the phone, speaking to 12 different people, as all claim they cannot help with this as it is down to a different department. Every time I am transferred I go through the wait process with the hold music, clear security, and am asked over and over again my reason for calling. A colossal waste of time for everyone involved.
I then cancel my payment as I'm told I will not have wifi between 13th October (date I move to new property), until they 'switch on' new broadband on 24th November- a whole 6 weeks later without any internet. During this time I am unable to work at home as I have no wifi. Roll on 24th November, day the internet is due to be switched on, and I have a call from the engineer (not affiliated to vodafone and was absolutely lovely), informing me he is unable to connect me and they havent authorised a job where they come into my property, just to the BT openfibre box, which doesn't have an active connection to my flat. Next I am sent a debt letter due to not paying for the 6 weeks of wifi that I HAVE NOT RECEIVED, and am forced to pay over £50 for an internet service that has not been provided, which I paid on the hope I would be reconnected on 24th November which didn't happen- meaning I've now paid for 2 months of a service which wasn't delivered. I am appalled at how bad this company is at delivering on their promises and their customer service. I will be leaving as soon as possible, and need to be reimbursed the money that they have scammed me out of. 0/10 communication skills, 0/10 customer service, 0/10 delivery on a product, effectively thieves for money on a non delivered service. Choose a different company if you value your time or money."
142636,"How does this company get away with treating its customers so badly? They have left a 94-year-old lady with no telephone hence no access to her emergency response company via her pendant that requires a telephone line to work.
I have telephoned their customer support line repeatedly over the last week only to be fobbed off with excuse after excuse. Received text messages saying an engineer had called and carried out work that was a lie. Also promised that the telephone line would be up and running within 24 hours another big fat lie.
I tried to raise a complaint and was told that they had a bucket list that they needed to go through first before I could speak to a manager to raise a complaint. What the hell is that the only bucket I need is because Talk Talk is making me sick!!!.
I requested a call from the manager and was told someone would call me and guess what no one did.
I have spent hours on the phone and live chatting to incompetent talk talk staff who are utterly useless.
Ofcom here I come as I will not let this go your staff lie, pass you from one department to another and all the time this lady is left with no phone to summon emergency help should she need it.
Well done talk talk."
108569,"Bought a ghd hairdryer which has now broken twice within the 12 month warranty. First 2 times sent back and you are without a hairdryer for approx 2-3 weeks while you wait for a replacement, not ideal when the product sold is poor quality. This time round the dryer is working but the nozzle keeps twisting so you can’t achieve the “smooth” blow dry they advertise, as air flow is not directed efficiently down the hair shaft. Phoned to ask for a nozzle replacement and advised that I will be put on a waiting list as no stock and they have no idea when stock will be available. Was informed by GHD customer service that nothing else can be done because you can still dry your hair without the nozzle. Even though I purchase the dryer with a nozzle included and it is now not fit for purpose. Stay well clear, poor products and terrible customer service when it breaks - which it will!"

Don't think I'll ever buy of them again"

152856,"Absolute shambles from start to finish (although not at the finish yet).
Supposedly repaired phone not repaired.
Second repair - was sent an exchange phone (different colour too) with no paperwork.
Third repair - exchange phone had same issue as original.
Fourth repair - seemed to be working but case has scratches and scuffs. Sent back again, new case fitted. Original issue reappeared."
121842,"Efficient service, best price available and delivered in the time slot given. Only thing we didn't like was pre recorded phone calls and someone trying to sell extended warranties before we had even received the item. But to be fair that was probably nothing to do with Hughes."
150092,"Second review of Cex, second time trying to get this pair of headphones in a grade A condition.

First time ordered them, they turned up and Bluetooth connectivity was faulty. Sent back for a refund and was initially impressed by the customer service. Finally got the refund, some back to card and some back to voucher.

Purchased another pair also listed as grade A as the customer service rep had given me a bit of faith that it was a one off (plus stuck with £60+ in vouchers) however they arrived and were a different type of headphone to the one pictured (they were the actual hello kitty ones) and covered in stains and marks.

Sent back for a refund which I’ve now received but am stuck with £60+ in Cex vouchers which I now won’t spend. Guess this is how they make their money?

Only positive from the whole experience was they covered the shipping fee on the returns and postie could pick it up from my doorstep."

189877,"Delayed arrival but amazing customer service and a great PC so far. I always know they are phone call away should anything go wrong but I doubt it. I'm a total newbie to PCs and I spoke to a guy on the phone (Steve maybe?) and he was extremely helpful and helped me order my PC with many helpful tips. I would give 4.5 as I felt I was chasing them for my PC - It took about a month to arrive rather than the 10-12 days specified on their website. Once I got in touch, they are very responsive and helpful so I can't complain - just wished I got in touch sooner."

Contacted the resolution team months ago still wating on reply;
UPDATE: got a reply from Abbie yesterday and got a refund on the delivery so they do answer your queries so all's well that ends well."

152121,"I was really pleased when I bought my Huawei P20 online, it was priced well and the associated talk time contract is competitive, unfortunately that is when things started to go downhill, the courier lost the parcel and it took numerous phone calls or emails to customer service and DPD spanning three weeks before I finally got the phone I ordered, at first customer service would not accept the couriers had lost it and kept giving me new delivery dates that never materialised, it was only resolved with two store visits by which time I was on the verge of cancelling the order. I will never again use the Carphone Warehouse Web page but will visit a branch instead."

169020,"WORST COMPANY EVER!!!

I have lost my phone signal so suddenly on August 18. I contacted customer services about 2-3 times til August 22, when I finally raised my issue to the complaints department. Similar to their service, they are the most unhelpful customer relations department that I ever had to deal with. It’s been more than 2 weeks, 4 sim swaps and so many customer service contacts and they still could not fix the problem to my line. The complaints department is telling me to wait again. Wait for what exactly?!!!!! I told them that I should not be charged for the weeks that I am not getting service as it is not fair that I am paying full price for service that I am not receiving. I now had to take a PAYG sim with another network!!! I should not be paying double for my mobile line!!! I have only been with Vodafone for about 3 months and I am so upset and dissatisfied with the network, their service and their response to network issues and to complaints. I was with 3 for 7 years and I am regretting why I ever signed a contract with Vodafone!!!!!!!!! Beware to any future customers: switch to any other network apart from Vodafone!"
152838,"The process was great start to finish, I was having small panics about the PC arriving in time for Christmas Day so reached out a couple of times, the team were always really supportive, flagged any potential issues with plenty of time and provided solutions to ensure there were no hitches with my son receiving his big gift on time.

Great service, won't hesitate using again or recommending to friends!"

Beko were useless and I'd been without a working appliance for nearly one month and still they couldn't give me a repair date. I declined to replace it with another Beko and upgraded to a Bosch, no more Beko products for me. Kendra was amazing, from attempting to mediate with Beko to organising the removal of the faulty dishwasher and replacement with the new. Additionally the engineers who arrived to do the job worked really hard to make the slightly larger Bosch fit, none of the jobsworth nonsense I've come to expect. No complaints or fuss just determined to do a good job. Moral of the story? AO are amazing, but don't buy Beko!"

151501,"One star is being to polite , would be a 0 , if it was a score!!
I could only suggest staying away from TalkTalk, not only is the service disgraceful , the staff are not trained enough to deal with simple situations , but do remain polite, ( they are only doing what there told to do ) but simple access to your account is an issue!
Being charged twice in one month is another issue!!!for almost three times the price of your original contract💵💵 considering that at I've had no add-ons or extras or phone calls just simple broadband, the advisers ask for 28 days to rectify the problem or sort out any issues but knowing after the next 15 days I'm tied to a contract , this is them trying to pin you into a corner but lucky enough I can pull out of a contract so I would advise anyone looking into TalkTalk to think very carefully before going ahead and maybe reading and taking notice of the reviews!!!!
I wish I did if TalkTalk could rectify and sort out all issues with myself and many other customers then maybe the reviews may change but I can't see that being the case.... TIME TO PUT THINGS IN ORDER TALKTALK!!!!! WE PAY FOR A SERVICE TRY PROVIDING WHAT WE ALL PAY FOR.. SPEND SOME OF YOUR PROFITS TRAINING YOUR STAFF AND SORTING YOUR TECHNICAL DETAILS OUT."
127097,"Good communication from start to finish.
Cheerful delivery man, polite."
174205,"I cannot begin to explain how angry and disappointed I was with Curries. Having shopped for many years here I have always picked my products up in store.

This one time I ordered delivery as the item I wanted was not in stock for a few weeks. I explained to the person in-store that the fridge freezer being ordered had to be delivered upstairs (as that is where my kitchen is) and this was all okay and in place.

Fast-forward to the delivery date Monday 09/01/23, my order doesn't come.... Nobody calls me so I call up and was notified that the delivery was unsuccessful, turns out the driver had gone to the wrong house and not even tried to make contact with me to ask me where I was and just left with my item.

I had taken the day off for this, spent the day at the property and wasted my time, money, fuel etc etc. After a lot of hassle I manage to rebook delivery for Friday 13/01/23.

Fast-forward 13/01/23 and my delivery finally comes, I am met by a rude delivery driver who takes a look at the fridge freezer space and says word for word ""You'll be fu*ked if you think we are lifting this up there mate"". Defiantly worth the £1000+ for that kind of exceptional service (Sarcasm). After a back and forth at my door they try to cancel the order and issue me a refund. I am extremely angry at this point and they leave the fridge in my hallway and that is that.

I call up Curries as the fridge is now in the property and I have to lift this 140kg fridge up the stairs by myself (which we do with no issue). So long story short it was a terrible service but in the end I have the fridge in the property and it works.

This doesn't come close to explaining the terrible, disgraceful service Curries provided from start to finish.

I have been given a complaints case reference starting CC which nobody has been in contact with me about. The initial compensation offer was £90 odd which is laughable for the experience I have had."
162096,"We have been with virgin media for the past 20+ years, we have decided to lower our services due to children leaving home and the cost of living. our current deal ends on 15.12.2022 we asked if we could move to the Big bundle offer at £33.00 I am currently paying 108.00 per month. My husband went on a WhatsApp chat on the 18th November that lasted from10.35 am until 13.25 pm to no avail. I phoned them today and was told could not swap as this is for new customers only. Been moved over on retention customer service today, trying to add more services that are not required at a higher cost than £33.00 a month. In the end I have told them would like to cancel after the renewal date as they don't listen, I was then told I would need to give 30 days notice from the date of my renewal and not from today so that would be from the 15.12.2022 another months cost of 167.48 as my offer would have finished. Disgusting service, you have lost a loyal customer for your greed."
184330,excellent product at a reasonable price

They told us it was the restaurant’s issue and the restaurant told us it was Deliveroo’s issue. When I flagged this, the woman (Josielyn) I spoke to was useless; the process took nearly an hour and she ended up ending the chat, knowing full well I was dissatisfied. I then emailed, but time and time again they sent pointless responses, ignoring my initial questions and showing no ability to looking after their customers. I will never use them again, given that their staff truly do not care, show no initiative, can’t even be bothered to read emails and are, quite frankly, rude."
109732,"Very easy and quick to sort out, and the guy was very helpful and friendly."
142619,Easy to find correct battery. Website shows critical dimensions an terminals. Competative prices. Next day delivery.
123394,I wouldn’t give them them the 1 star you need to rate them. The people you deal with obviously read from a script and god help them if they deviate from it. You spend hours trying to convince them you are the person you actually are trying to sort out a minor issue and when you do you spend many more hours(26 in total in my case) to answer basic questions. Is it me or was it a little easier back in the day to just speak to a real human being to sort out an issue?
131305,Great service and very pleasant communications.

172897,"My elderly father is only on basic State Pension. He has been so stressed about the fuel price hikes that he stopped heating his home, and as a result has spent a day and a half in hospital with hypothermia.

I'm an 'authorised contact' for his dual fuel account and so decided to call Shell to find out if there were any payment alternatives. I was dreading the call as I was expecting a 'fight' resulting in a 'No, we can't help you'.

However this wasn't the case at all! I was put through to a lady called Gosia K. She was kind and sympathetic and calmly talked me through the options, explaining the pros and cons of each as I had asked. I wanted to talk through the options with my father so she offered to call me back at a pre-arranged time, so that she could action his decision today. Unfortunately we had telecoms issues at home and after a number of unsuccessful attempts, she sent me an email saying she was trying to contact me as promised, and suggesting that we communicate via email instead.

The result is that my father is happy with the new billing arrangement and now feels more in control of the situation and his money. Thanks so much, Gosia K!"
118670,"Reasonably easy to set up despite knowing nothing about computers. Information around dispatch was a little lacking or I would have given it 5 stars, possibly this was due to the courier and it being Christmas! One question though, there dries not appear to be any volume, if I needed to buy speakers it would have been useful to highlight this. Paying for it was a bit of a pain, I expected to just enter my bank details, or to have to go into a bank to arrange a transfer."

185668,"As you can probably tell how bad this company is with the amount of bad reviews.

Should be shut down by the government its madness that the government has not investigated this company by far the worst phone provider i've ever come across.

I wish nothing bad on these people nothing but liars and scammers!

If anyone knows any petitions that we can start to take this company down please let me know!"
139613,"Edited 15/08/22: After posting my initial review of BT, I have been pleasantly surprised by the excellent standard of customer service delivered by their social media team. Following on from my extremely negative experience,(please see below) I reached out to this team on the advice given and I was met with courtesy, empathy and efficiency that I did not believe BT could offer. Not only did they help me get my issue resolved, they actually kept their word and called back when they said they would! Going forward, if I have ever have any issues with BT again, I will contact their social media team, they're brilliant and a credit to the company.


We've been loyal (and gullible) enough to remain customers of BT for over 10+ years but the last 2-3 years, their customer service and broadband has been absolutely appalling! We're supposed to be getting an average speed of 30mb/s potentially reaching up to 40mb/s, however, our speeds have dropped to below 20mb/s and have stayed that way for a while now. We were told a Cube engineer would come out, but on the appointed day, no such engineer showed up, but the status on the fault on my online account showed as if the engineer visit was complete! He NEVER showed up! I was supposed to receive a follow-up call the next day but instead received an email telling me that they couldn't get hold of me (another LIE as no one bothered calling as promised!) and that they'd closed the complaint!?! We're now waiting for an alleged appointment due to happen later this week with a follow-up phone call, but I'm not holding my breath. BT are LIARS, they claim to offer outstanding customer service (they actually have the audacity to make this claim when you call up!), but they clearly don't understand anything about customer service (somebody should buy them a dictionary so they can check out the meaning of the word 'outstanding'!) This is just the most recent issue I've had with BT, the last 2 years have been a series of inconsistent speeds and absolutely appalling levels of customer service. If you want extreme levels of stress, high blood pressure, and a company that excels in incompetence, then by all by means sign up to BT, you won't be disappointed!!!"
109897,"Slight delay with processing due to the bank holiday which was before the weekend. I posted on the Monday after, so didn't think mine would be affected, but it was. Did receive full payment 34hrs after it was received by them.
Understandably they were not open on the bank holidays (Jubilee) but nothing was advised on their website. I had to call up twice to the call center to see why there was a delay. Information on their website could have clarified this for me and I'm sure others too."
158587,"I ordered a Samsung Galaxy Note20 phone on the 13th October for the next available delivery date which was the 15th October.
I hadn't received any update to advise that the phone would be delivered so I contacted customer services via online chat.
When querying where my phone was, their response was:
'I managed to check on your order and I can see that upon additional verification the order has been declined and has been requested to be returned to ourselves. Unfortunately, we are unable to specify the exact reasons for declining the transaction. As you have paid an upfront cost of 749.99 this will be refunded back to you once we have processed the device back into our warehouse.'

When I asked when I'd receive my refund, they stated it'd be 3-5 working days after the device had been received back into the warehouse. I'm confused as to how it's even left the warehouse if the order has been declined?

So they've been unable to confirm what the exact issue was, but have been happy and able to take almost £750 out of our bank account and tell us that it can take up to a week for us to get it back.

I advised the customer service representative to pass on feedback to the relevant department to ensure that a customer is made aware if an order can't be processed or a delivery isn't possible. I was writing a further response when the representative ended the conversation.

Poor communication from a company who is well established and should have better processes in place. No empathy from customer services and no desire to even get an answer for you.
Ordered elsewhere and won't be using the company again."

119501,"The guys were punctual, polite, friendly and efficient."
112109,"Great quality, even for the basic options, just watch out for the added extras, quickly doubles / triples the price but having said that if you want added quality for a special occasion still a good price"
198540,"Unfortunately I cannot give minus a zillion stars.
I was a customer of NOW TV way back in April for 1 month. After the worse experience I have had with a company, to cut an extremely long story short, I was allowed to leave penalty free!
3 months later I noticed NOW TV had stolen 3 monthly payments from my account. I had an horrendous experience with customer service, ( then abroad ), sent bank statements showing £90 in total had been taken as proof, was assured that no further monies could be taken from my account as no longer possible. Covid-19 stopped communication for a while.
On Tuesday I went to place an order for my son's special diet ( he has several disabilities ), and found I could not pay due to lack of funds which I knew I had. On checking, NOW TV had taken almost £34 from my account, leaving me unable to pay for his dietary needs. On further checking NOW TV had taken 8 monthly payments totalling
£234.88.
After another 2 exhausting days trying to get my stolen money back, my only option is to report it as fraud to my bank. The only fraud being committed is by NOW TV.
This company needs to be shut down they are completely unethical, disgraceful and disgusting. Avoid!!! especially if you have vulnerable loved ones.

USEFUL TIP
NEVER pay for broadband with your debit or credit card and ALWAYS by direct debit which can be stopped immediately preventing this kind of theft from happening as they can keep requesting payments months after you have no account with them."
115733,Arrived promptly and staff were very helpful
182753,Undetected on 2 pcs. Even in disk manager. To be returned.
194306,Excellent product and delivered in quick time
101554,I am sick to death of paying £10 just to watch a F1 race every weekend its on. I don't have any interest in watching any of the other channels. Make a pass for JUST Sky F1 without all the other channels. I have to pay £10 for a few hours of TV. Its a joke.
107018,I can't believe what a shower BT has become!! I am a business customer who pays extra for critical care and have had several promised appointments just not turned up to. I pay for two broadband lines just because there equipment is so crap one keeps breaking down. Crackling phone lines and useless broadband with no fix in sight. BT don't care because in my area there's no competition If I ran my business like they do I would be down the pan in a month. ITs disgusting
130323,"On 23/11/22, I signed up online for full fibre broadband. I received a batch of emails confirming the order and confirming that the engineer would visit on 6/1/23 to complete the installation. Vodaphone let my existing provider know of the switchover and they confirmed cancellation of my existing service with effect from 6/1/23.

On 4/1/23, I tried to use the temporary password from Vodaphone to log into my new account and kept getting an error message to say that this account was cancelled. I then realised they hadn't sent me any equipment and I'd had no emails from delivery companies telling me a package from Vodaphone was on the way so realised something major was wrong. A scan through my emails showed that I had had no further communication from Vodaphone since those confirming my order and the installation appointment.

This morning (5/1) I went into the local shop and the guy confirmed that the order was cancelled and gave me a number to call. They said, from experience, it would take at least 10 days to sort out and I could have a dongle in the meantime to provide 4G.

Joe, in Customer Service, was excellent but was very limited in what he could do personally. He contacted someone on the technical side who said it would take 2-3 weeks to rebuild the order AND the price of that package had now gone up so I would have to pay the new price(!!!!!) Joe's manager authorised him to rebuild the order at the original price and he apologised for the poor service, saying it was not what Vodaphone customers should expect. He was exemplary!

I run a business from home so I absolutely cannot have a break in my broadband service. A break of 10 days to 3 weeks will cost me a lot of money! The hours spent working on this today have lost me money as I should be working.

The result is that I now have a choice: try to get my existing provider to cancel the switch-off (but what are the chances of that going right at this late stage?) or accepting a dongle, having 4G wifi for 10 days to 3 weeks, and then continuing to do business with a company which has treated me appallingly and left me in an awful position.

I'll have to think that through but in the meantime I can be absolutely clear that if I had known this was going to happen, I would NEVER have signed up for Vodaphone and would advise anyone else to be VERY careful before they think about doing so.

UPDATE: I went to the local Vodafone shop to rebuild the order and they said they couldn't offer it at the price I had signed up for and the manager couldn't authorise a discount. I came home again and called the complaints department. They authorised the discount (the contract I had with Vodafone!) and set up the new account BUT they have set it up at a higher price AND they can't get the engineer to do the installation until 30/1 at the earliest (25 days). I'm away then so the earliest date we can do is 7/2, a month and a day after it was due. So what do I do about internet in the meantime? Seems I have to have a 4G dongle. And I thought I was getting full fibre broadband on 6/1!!! What kind of company is this????

RE THE REPLY BELOW: I gave you more than enough chances to put this right and after spending 4 hours on a day when I should have been working trying to sort it out, the decision was made that I won't ever do business with Vodafone again."

Was NOT impressed with how many times the Currys website recommends and reminds that they can ""recycle your old appliance for free, to save you the hassle"" ...UM nah it's okay, I'm not giving you anything for free!!

It's disgraceful, these businesses that abuse being green as a way to steal or collect more £££.

I didn't bother buying my 'EXPENSIVE' TV from Currys, I question their persuasive recycling suggestion as just a way to uplift your old tech, fix it, sell it on, and for sure break it down for parts - if you want my old appliances, YOU CAN BUY THEM IN THE local SECOND FOR SALE section online.

£35 delivery, trying to salvage my old appliances for free, under the guise of 'recycling' ? naaaah.... I went elsewhere, I don't trust Currys, not even a little."

We renewed our contract six months ago at £78.00 per month. Now six months later the last bill was £92. That's it, we are going with another provider even though it is going to cost us over £500. We will have that back in a little over a year with what we are saving, cheaper than paying their prices for another 18 months."
134702,Simple and quick service. Only thing that disappoints is the communication for delivery. Stated I should have been contacted at 9am to let me know 2hr delivery slot. Nothing. Unable to check tracking as it didn’t change from being loaded on the van. Waited in until 16:10 for delivery. Delivery men polite with no issue. Just would have been nice to be kept in the loop.

As I'd ordered small flat items attached to a manufacturers secure card which, sent in a padded envelope, would easily fit through our A4 x 30mm deep letterbox. Carrier Royal Mail if that's what it's called so no problems, or so I thought. Unfortunately the cards were sealed in a fairly large box, so as I was out this had to be collected. Not the end of the world, but the traffic and collection queues could easily have been avoided by the seller indicating the standard size of packaging to be used. Not so helpful for non driving customers. This facility would warrant 5 STAR SERVICE, review"

163495,"I had repeated service issues and raised this with them. They completely failed to remedy the issues and once a complaint had been lodged I got repeated texts telling me they had tried to contact me, which was untrue. No one called, no-one left any voicemails. As a result of not getting the service I paid for, I cancelled my direct debit and emailed them to advise them accordingly. Despite this, I got an email telling me I owed 2 months service charges, which I won't be paying. Totally, utterly dismal service and complaints handling. I won't ever use them again, ever

So I get a response asking for me to post details on Twitter or Facebook. Sorry, not doing this TalkTalk as I don't use Twitter and I totally mistrust Meta. If you want to contact me I'll give you my phone number. Oh, but like the numerous texts and emails you previously sent me, you stated someone had tried contacting when they hadn't......more of the same. I STRONGLY ADVISE - DON'T USE TALKTALK

It's now the 21st September and I have had no correspondence from TalkTalk, which is consistent with how they dealt with my original complaint i.e. they did nothing. I find it rather ironic that a communications company cannot communicate with its customers!!"

Text this morning to say it’s coming on Weds, no apology & no priority delivery for the inconvenience. Eventually spoke to customer services- got scripted responses. Apparently the driver had too many jobs! You don’t say?

I was told I had months left on a contract on the 30 day rolling contract I joined with!  Obviously I raised a complaint and requested a copy of the calls that had taken place between myself and NowTV..  I have requested this information 4 times over 3 months and still have received nothing, despite them agreeing to send it (as is everyone's right) and my raising a complaint every time.

Things have got so bad complaints have been with the data protection commissioner.

185589,"Absolute nightmare to cancel. Ignored correspondence giving notice of cancellation and left us waiting on hold for hours (both on the phone and online chat) when trying to speak to someone about recent emails. On some occasions, we got through to some people who were entirely unsympathetic and unsure of procedures transferring you from one member of staff to the next, other times, no one answered. They continued sending my 70 year old Nan bills despite her being with another provider which really worried her and caused her distress. After she just paid the money for another 30 days to sort the situation and for another notice period, our family ensured the contract was over and asked Virgin not to contact her ever again. There has been two/three calls since then asking her why she left and asking if she would like to sign up again.

UPDATE:
Four months later and still ongoing. On Christmas Day (a few weeks later after paying all the money), my Nan was so worried and telling us that they have sent her another bill. Absolutely disgusting."
139040,Terrible experience with D&G. When you do finally get through to someone on the phone they either hang up or put you back on the automated answering service. Very unhelpful - no one takes ownership of the issue and try and resolve it - they just pass it on to another department - you end up getting the run around

Once the product arrived it came with a locked screen so I couldn’t immediately use it! Had to wait even longer to get the passcode to unlock it! Very long winded process ! Also there is no call centre, not being able speak to a human being is very frustrating ! I was going to lose my patience and cancel the order but they managed to rectify the issues before I lost my mind ! The only reason I am leaving two stars and not one is because the product itself was in good condition."
196717,"Time wasting id1ots with no common sense what so ever!

Ordered a new phone on a black Friday deal. Recently moved house and put my new address on the order obviously and also my shortened first name rather than my first full name, which I have always done for the last 20+ years on every order including every phone contract I've ordered previously either directly with a provided or via a third party seller. Ordered my new phone with o2, and my current contract is also with o2 which I'm replacing with this order, also under the same name.

Get an email asking for additional information, stating details I have provided do not match the details O2 hold for my account, requesting a copy of my recent o2 bill. My current phone contract was still registered to my previous address having only recently moved 3 months ago (which you already knew about when I ordered the phone as you asked for my current address and previous address on the order). So provided the previous o2 bill which has the same name on it as my current order, and my previous address, along with an explanation for the name difference and address change.

I then called yesterday and had to wait on hold for nearly an hour before getting through to speak to someone. Spoke with the advisor to discuss the name difference (i.e. my shortened first name on the order vs my full first name) and my address changed, to ensure everything is ok. He stated that the ID provided was still queuing to be processed, but should all be fine. He advised I update my address on the o2 app so that my old contract matches my new one just to ensure the order goes through. Other than that all else should be fine. So I went ahead and updated my address on my current soon to end o2 contract.

I then get an email yesterday evening asking for more ID, this time my driver's license and a utility bill. Provided these, both have my current new address on them and also my full first name on my driver's license. Again all matching what I'd already declared.

These id1ots then still cancel my order immediately after stating ""couldn't process your order due to an incorrect name"". Absolute time wasting Muppets.

I then call again today, again having to wait nearly an hour on hold before I got through, had to explain all this again (having to repeat myself multiple times as the advisor just wasn't getting it) and the advisor states that if names don't fully match on all documents then we cancel the order automatically regardless. Then why waste my time asking for extra ID and explanations from the start if you already full well know you'll be cancelling the order regardless of what I provide? No common sense what so ever. The name provided on my order is exactly the same as my name on my previous o2 contract and every other phone contracts I've ever had!

Was told I'd have to start a new order again, so I questioned what happens to the deal I ordered originally, since I ordered a black Friday deal so want the same deal if I have to start my order all over again all due to you faffing about, only to be told I can't have the same deal.

I also get told that if I reorder with my full name on the order, that may also get cancelled because it won't match the shortened first name on my previous o2 contract. You frekin kidding me? how stupid can you be? So no matter what I do the order would get cancelled.

Absolute time wasting morons. Don't bother with this lot, go elsewhere. Complete waste of time.

Also, when there's a problem pick up the bloody phone and call your customers! Don't send them automated emails and request us to call you, and leave us waiting in the queue for an hour each time!"

My contract has been changed twice without consent. I have been billed higher amount for last two months and not being refunded. Customer services is a big joke. Promise you action in 48h but nothing gets done. You have to wait in que for ages to speak to an agent who messes up everything. Complaints raised by yourself or agents not actioned but marked as resolved. Standard reply by agents - complaint raised and will be actioned in 48H, no summary or copy is provided as it all internal. You are provided a c-no which cannot be traced or actioned.

121992,"Spoke to another advisor, Luke, who, although seemed nice at first, was very unhelpful. He didn't come across as fully understanding Shells procedures. He confirmed Shell don't keep customers information after 6 months, which I find unbelievable. Also stated Shell don't keep notes with regards to any faults. Be very mindful if choosing to go with Shell. Although their customer service may be hit and miss, if you do experience any faults or issues, they are not very helpful at all. They will not treat you as a 'customer'."
137934,"keeping it short and simple, I regret ever using ebuyer to build out a new desktop. 3 out of the 5 components ordered were dead and had to be RMA, thats fine it happens the issue is that it took 9 weeks from placing the order to getting a working desktop. trying to speak to a manager/senior level was impossible and when raising concerns nothing happened.

Was a far more painful experience then it needed to be took way too long and I settled for a downgrade in replacement RMA components just the end the ordeal and wash my hands of them."

I thought OK I will just take the service with me and cancel my contract in October when it expires. BUT if I take the service to my new home BT have this wonderful clause that you have broken the contract and will be signed up until May next year. As I am paying £60 pcm to BT, don't need or want the landline I protested and said cancel the whole service. Now I have to pay £174 to do this ! But as there are lots of companies that can supply broadband for around £20 pcm I will still save money even if I have to pay this extortionate fee."

122257,Had to wait a little while for my new Hyundai HY27550 Silent Compressor from FFX but in all fairness to the guys at FFX they kept me in the loop the whole time. It was merely a supply and demand issue. Their help desk staff are awesome. As for FFX to buy from...undercut every other dealer out there and then...gave me a 10% discount for joining their mailing list. BEAT THAT. As for the compressor...simply WOW. So quiet after my Wolf Cheyenne 3hp and definitely knocks the socks off it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

141367,"A word of advice , if you want a professional service that actually delivers your goods then don't use Currys / Team Knowhow.
I waited all Saturday afternoon for my delivery which was a no - show.
Don't bother calling Team Knowhow because when you eventually do get through ( 4 attempts / 2hrs in total ) they are clueless and will just repeat when your items are next due and won't acknowledge the fact that you can't trust the next due date.
A really poor service and I shall never order from Currys again .
Tony Collins.
Thank you for your apology Ryan , however your symphathy doesn t guarantee that I will get my items delivered this Saturday and judging by the huge amount of other complaints I'm not getting my hopes up.
If these items are not delivered this Saturday I won't have a working oven or hob for Christmas Day .
So I received a phone call telling me they will only deliver 1 item because they found the other 2 to be damaged.
Eventually they delivered the 1 good item and guess what .... when i opened it , that was damage as well.
To cut a very long and frustrating story short I have now cancelled my order.
To save yourself a huge waste of time and being lied to PLEASE AVOID THESE AMATUERS !"
124776,"I ordered a jumper from Very, the quality of the item was great. Unfortunately I was sent the wrong size. I ordered a 12 and was sent a 16. I was going to return it and reorder but the item had sold out by then. I decided to keep the item for now because the main reason for ordering it was so that I'd have something loose-fitting to wear while I recover from surgery, but I'll probably end up having to put it in a charity shop when I'm better, which is a shame because in the right size this probably would've been one of my favourite tops."
157017,Ordering was easy. The price was competeitive and delivery on time.
128560,"Very poor customer service - broadband does not work despite being informed multiple times that the service had gone live. When buying the product, I did not have to wait more than a few minutes to speak to an advisor who was only too happy to sell me the product. When trying to phone in relation to this issue, I spent roughly two hours on hold after initially having an advisor not listem to the problem and try to sell me a mobile deal instead. It would appear that BT are very willing to speak to prospective customers but likely to ignore customers' problems once they have been signed up and tied-in. It's really poor, and it is not even possible to speak to a real person about this. Very, very disappointed with BT."
142660,"Always a pleasure to visit RS. It's more of an adventure than just a shopping trip. My wife would leave me there all day. These guys have a genuine enthusiasm for what they do as well as extensive knowledge of all the products and will match any other genuine price out there. I recently had to change a product and no fuss, no hassle whatsoever. I also had a TV installation and again everything went exactly as it should have done. These guys could teach a few other so called retail outlets what the word service actually means."
174379,Excellent. Good product delivered quickly.
169524,"I have been with 3 for over 10 years and they have given me a good service I can’t complain with that. I have never missed a payment. the only issue I have is I just don’t feel like they given me much for being a customer for that long and i think I’ll be going to another provider! The difference to being a new customer and a existing customer does not seem much if anything! It’s a big factor to show loyalty to your customers and I really feel like 3 really don’t show this!

157395,"Hi, I had nowtv broadband 8 days ago. There are at least 50 times (sometimes each 10 mins) dropping out seen per a day so far, also the speed sometimes is not stable. It made me crazy. I texted costumer service. They helps me, and told me that the first ten days is normal. I have never seen any broadband that give fluctual signals to ther costumer. It is the worst broadband that I have ever seen in the UK. I do not recommend anyone to use it. If I had not to use it, I would not select it. My zone is not available for many firms and there is so few contract for 12 months. So, there is no any good things but costumer service. It is totally disappointment for me. If it still continues within 1 week, and they do not solve it, I will cancel it. It affected my work, study and communications."
150648,"Delivered by Yodel. I went out to meet the driver just in time to see the driver lift the parcel/battery onto his shoulder (probably not the best manual handling technique) and then drop it.
Thankfully the battery survived, but still, maybe worth perusing a contract with a safer courier?"

125265,"The worst experience I’ve every encountered. I have spent a full day ringing customer services at currys to carphone warehouse sales and back forth. I was then told I had not contacted them as they had no record of the phone log, so making it out I was telling lies. The phones in store, it’s not in store, it’s been dispatched, they couldn’t find it!! Honestly it’s been a nightmare, so bad, I cancelled the order and I’m now left with a migraine. Avoid at all costs. I will most definitely be putting a complaint in, it’s ruined my weekend."
196535,"Was my go to place, but been waiting the best part of a month for my order, tracking hass been deleted, chat has no agents availble and I'm 42 in line to be spoken to when I try and call them. WHO CAN I TALK TO. Customer service is non-existent."
168576,Dako B was very helpful today and sorted out my questions with shell energy
116896,"I have used Carphone Warehouse in the past with no issues but my latest experience has left me feeling i would never use them again as their customer care in resolving my issue of paying two contracts wrongly has carried on for months with empty promises from each person i have spoken to or emailed in the process. I have had and continue to have terrible customer experience as I am being charged two contracts for the past 5 months now, although I rang within two days of realising there were two mobile contracts in my name. I was assured the correction would be made. I rang their customer helpline each month when I had continued to be charged for two contracts. Each month I was being told it had been escalated and will be resolved. I also sent an official letter of complaint and again I was told it would be resolved. I was Advised to ring the mobile company asking them to cancel the second contact and Carphone Warehouse would reimburse me the money which I did although this meant I would be out of pocket to pay the cancellation fee of £380. I have already paid 5 months of contract for a mobile number i never used. Carphone Warehouse has since stopped communicating with me I am out of pocket of money and still paying two contracts I am very angry I have to go through this process and will never recommend using Carphone Warehouse if this is the way customers are treated.

UPDATE 25/01/2021

Since my last post I have followed advice given and I still have not received the money owed to me. This is 7 months on and being owed over £400.00. Carphone warehouse is now saying Vodafone should refund me the money which is not what I was originally told. I would like my money back. This is a significant amount of money if I had it in a saving account would of earned me interest in the months this has been carrying on."

107015,"Signed up for a SIM only contract and got the SIM within a couple of days. All the packaging said it was already activated but it still didn't work 24 hours after installing. I also couldn't log onto my account using the temporary password I'd been emailed. This would only ever give a message that an error has occurred and to try again a moment later.

I used the webchat to complain and was told my account hadn't been activated and would be sorted within 24 hours. It wasn't so I tried again the next day to be told it would be done by midnight. Again, it wasn't so I contacted them again and got told 24 hours once again. This time I waited another 2 days before contacting them to be told it would be done by midnight. A day later and I still have no mobile.

From what I can see, Vodafone are utterly useless. I've had enough and since I'm still within my 14 day cool off period I'll be ringing up to cancel later. My hopes of Vodafone actually managing that without charging me again are slim.

18/03/22 A further update. I just had the most painful conversation ever with someone presumably in India when attempting to cancel the contract. The call seemed to be on a 10 second delay the whole time and mostly consisted of her saying ""Hello"" over me repeatedly. She couldn't find my account for the first 15 minutes because I couldn't give them a mobile number I didn't have. Then when she did find my account, I was told my contract couldn't be cancelled because my account wasn't active and I would need to ring back in 24 hours. After venting for a while about why I wasn't going to do this, and how this was in breach of consumer rights, she said they would ring me back on Monday between and 1 and 2. I couldn't take any more and reluctantly accepted. This level of service is so poor it beggars belief. I'll go straight to complaints when they presumably don't ring back on Monday. If that doesn't work, next stop will be the ombudsman.

22/03/22 I didn't get a call back and the account still isn't activated. I got a reply to this review from Vodafone suggesting to contact the social media team via Facebook/Twitter. I had to sign up to Twitter specifically for the purpose but finally got a clear answer that they apparently won't activate the SIM and account until the day my old number is due to switch on 1st April. This isn't how a switch has worked for me in the past but they also confirmed my cancellation period won't start until then so I'll give them a last chance. The moral of all this seems to be to avoid Vodafone's call centres and go to their social media team if you want any help.

06/04/22
My account activated as promised above and I've had no problems since. Still not happy with the state of the service I received or the contradictory communication about how the switch process worked in the first place but I'm revising up to 3 stars since they did at least get there in the end."

196963,"Piotr R. dealt with this call with great skill and professionalism. My enquiry is apparently quite complex, and I was calling again to raise an issue that a less effective colleague had reached a dead-end with previously. Piotr immediately gave me with the confidence that he had grasped the issue and went back and forth between me and various teams seeking a resolution. Each time he returned to me for further details I could sense that he was making progress and that we weren’t going around in circles. He repeatedly acknowledged the frustration that I was feeling. I trust that with Piotr on the case I have a great chance of a positive outcome here. Thank you."
179850,"Terrible experience with Three. We had their 5G mobile home broadband, which was never reliable, but stopped working almost entirely after 4 months. We called, and Three explained that there was ongoing engineering work in our area, that had been happening for some time, so this was causing the issue. It would also not be finished for another 4 months and so there was no prospect of our internet improving.

We were annoyed that they'd known about the fault but not let us know that our service would be affected, but we agreed with them that this was grounds to cancel our contract and walk away. Unfortunately this was only the beginning of a saga that's lasted for 8 months.

Three's many departments don't seem to communicate well with each other, and so the customer is left chasing round trying to sort everything out, speaking to many different people about the same issue, spending hours on calls.

We were told that only the technical team could approve the cancellation - we called them, they approved, we waited. Then we called again to check on the status, there was no record of our cancellation request, so we were told we'd need to call the technical team again. We did, they approved. Then we were told to post the router back, only after they we had sent the router would our account be considered cancelled. They delayed sending the returns pack for ages, then when we sent it back they did not log it in their system for 2 months.

We then cancelled our DD from the date that we sent the router back. We were assured by Three that all was in order and our account was cancelled.

Sometime later we got an email saying they had not received payment and they were going to transfer our case to a debt collection agency. We called Three again and explained the situation. They said all is fine, they have 'written a note on the account' and there was nothing more we could do. It was all cancelled and there.

Then we got a note saying it had be passed to a debt collection agency. And they emailed demanding payment.

We called Three again. Went through it all again. They assured us all was well. They were sorry. We should ignore all other demands on this issue. It was fine.

More letters and emails from debt collectors. We called again. All was not fine. After about 4 more calls, to various people our issue got escalated high enough for the customer complaints manager to sort it out and wipe our account.

Still we got another email from the debt collectors. We had to reach out to them separately ourselves to tell them that Three was a basket case organisation and they should stop chasing us. They agreed.

Terrible company. We will, 100% categorically, never use any of their services again, and recommend you don't either."
120432,Prompt response from them to come and fix it for me and the engineers they have sent have been very polite and courteous

143341,"Was originally offered over £200 for my phone, this was marked down to around £45 due to various types of non existent damage.

I rejected the offer, and Mazuma upped the offer to £100 as some of the repair work could now be done in house.

I declined the offer and had the device returned. When I received the device back, I took it and sent it straight to a competitor who paid the full predicted value of £200 straight away.

How can one company say it is worth £45 and another over £200?

Shoddy business practices here I think. Would strongly recommend looking at competitors."
171180,Try leaving BT just spent half an hour trying to the leaving team wife tried to ring sales answer straight away very poor customer service
108879,"Hi All,
I have been a customer of Three for over 10 years now, always paying my direct debits on time, I had plans with phone included in the bundle, and more recently sim only plans, but always on a contract. Things went downhill however earlier this year, and I have been unable to connect my iPhone to a network. After about 4 or 5 interactions via complaints chatline, and having to send an email to 'proofs' team to reset my log in data (and of course no response from those for a couple of days now), I think the time has come to go elsewhere.
I will just say this, customer support is very, very poor... as long as your coverage is fine, and everything goes to the plan, you will enjoy it, it's decently priced too. However, as soon as you hit a glitch, and you need help, you need someone who knows how to fix things, you will soon realise that this is just going to be a pain down your bottom, big time. Sad to be writing this, especially that I'd rather stay with the same network and just keep paying like I did but the service is just so poor, you will end up wasting your nerves and having to repeat yourself over and over again.

UPDATE 22/08/2022 - I reached out to Three again, by the link from Ankita, and big fat NOTHING - A guy responded on the chat, didn't really know or understand what is happening. I explained the situation and the fact that I have to have my credentials reset by the PROOFS team, whom I emailed 17 DAYS AGO, and I received zero response. So, long story short is this, my phone doesn't connect to a network at all, I am locked out of my online account, I am unable to receive any OTP messages of course, I don't remember my secret answer to pass the account checks - for some reason they are not willing to ask other questions - and essentially I am paying monthly direct debit for nothing.
I think I need to raise it to the regulator and put an end to this nonsense. Three is just not willing to respond to the crucial email to update my credentials despite me sending a photo of me with my passport and all the other details they asked for.

UPDATE on 19/12/2022
My case is still pending. Three advised they will cancel my contract in the end as they were unable to fix my connection issues, yet I see they are still going to charge me my monthly direct debit tomorrow. Cannot express enough how shambolic this whole experience has been. As you can see it's been 4 month since my initial complaints. But then again.. no surprises there since they really take their time responding to each email (of course reassuring you with zero confidence in each email that they will try to reach a mutually satisfactory outcome!). For your own peace of mind STAY CLEAR!"

118124,"What a shame Vodafone has seemingly recently acquired for itself such a poor reputation for customer service if many of these reviews are to be accepted!
And how awful then seems to be the case of the behaviour and culture of the company, including it seems its 'bereavement team's' behaviour to the family of a well-known figure? But how does anyone, who is at all discerning, decide to have or continue to have any sort of personal contract with Vodafone if they are aware of all of these negative reviews and adverse consumer experiences?
A few years ago I looked after my much loved mother who suffered from Alzheimer's and sadly died as a result of that dreadful affliction, maybe at least 10 years 'before her time'. And I then had to deal with all of her affairs, which included a mobile phone account with Vodafone. And I clearly remember the company at the time (including the bereavement team) being so helpful in assisting me with the relevant matters, and resolving the financial situation in reasonable and compassionate manner, that the experience remains embedded in my memory. So: What on earth has happened since then!? It is so depressing to hear of these terribly negative experiences of Vodafone customers, and it just adds it seems to the general malaise seemingly caused by so many things nowadays. Vodafone now appears to have abandoned a previous good record of compassionate customer service to customers, particularly those dealing with such sad matters as bereavement, and caring for vulnerable loved ones.
Whereas, only a few years ago I would have gladly recommended it, particularly at least on the grounds of exercising compassion!"
190572,"AVOID!
I purchased an iPhone from Quick Mobile Fix on the 25th of October. My Samsung Galaxy was on its last legs so I required a replacement mobile ASAP.
The transaction went through ok and I waited for my replacement mobile to arrive.
When there was still no sign of my order by the 06th of November I decided to cancel and take my business elsewhere.
So I ordered the same iPhone from I Need a mobile.com which arrived the following day in pristine condition!,
Meanwhile ~9 weeks after parting with my £222.99, placing my order with Quick Mobile Fix and then cancelling I have not seen any sign of a refund.
After various emails and excuses from the QMF I have now referred this issue to my card provider for a refund through the Bank Chargeback scheme.

Be warned before you do business with this company!"
100573,"DO NOT BOTHER! Don’t waste your time ordering from this company. It’s not worth it. There the most unorganised company I have ever come across. Upon ordering two Christmas items I checked the order for them to state that they were out of stock and to wait 14 days? I didn’t want Christmas items after Christmas, there was no notification the item being out of stock when ordering. I asked them to cancel the order and refund me. I was told they can’t do anything with my order. Awful. They then consistently ring you twice a day from a call centre abroad who didn’t even no what’s going on.
I emailed them so many times as I still haven’t even received the said items and I have been told about 5 different things. They were investigating then I was told to wait another 5 days, which takes me past Christmas. Then I was told to wait at least 30 days. Then I was told they would credit my account when I don’t even have an account with them I paid outright for my items. There a shambles, they haven’t got a clue what’s going on. They don’t read previous communications and will do everything they can to get out of refunding peoples money.
I’m now being bombarded with calls again, which I refuse to answer. Who needs this stress? It’s hard enough at the moment let alone trying to get Christmas items with little money and then not even receiving them.

No doubt I will get a million calls again after this review. Awful company.
I have sent a complaint through to trading standards as I’m surprised these guys are even still running."

Phoned Repaircare who booked the repair for team know how on 6/11 and was told they emailed Currys on 5/11 advising it's beyond economical repair,so phoned Team Know-it-all same day and they confirmed they received the email but the machine still needed to be written off by themselves and then we would receive a voucher in 7 or so days. Phoned on 9/11 to see progress and was told machine was written off and now was waiting to be evaluated (I managed to price an equivalent machine in less than 3 minutes!!)before the voucher would be issued. Chased Team Know-F@#&-all on 13,16,17&18/11 and told STILL needing evaluated! Was told this was escalated on three separate occasions as it still needed evaluation after being written off,then on 19/11 I am told machine HASN'T been written off at all! Had we been told this from the start we could have requested a replacement under the 7day repair promise but as we have been lied to repeatedly from every team know how member of staff I have talked to about this we thought we were getting a voucher imminently.Someone then claimed to be 'super escalating' this and it would then be actioned in the next day or two and early this week we would have our voucher,only to find out on the 24/11 that there has now been a discrepancy with the report from the engineer writing the machine off (the engineer confirmed to me that they don't write the machine they only recommend the costs involved) and as such they have had to request another report from the engineer which means more delays to be processed!!!"

Unfortunately, it was too small (my error) so I had to return and order an alternative. Again, I ordered the replacement, free standard delivery, on a Wednesday afternoon, and it arrived around 11am the following morning!
Similarly, they offer a collection service for returns (for a small fee...something which one of their big rivals didn't offer last time I used them) which was just as efficient.
As someone who has 15+ years in the retail industry, working for some companies who certainly hadn't nailed their online processes, this is exactly how online shopping should work.
Fantastic, and highly recommended."

The packaging however from the warehouse was questionable, when you spend that amount of money on a hairdryer you’d expect it to be better packaged in the shopping box, minimal packing was used to stop it being thrown around in the box (which we all know it happens) and eliminate or at best minimise damage in transit.

148472,"On behalf of brother who sent an iPhone to sell. He was offered £140 and took offer. He sent in the iPhone for music magpie to tell him after they received the phone we can no longer pay you £140 as your iPhone screen is smashed and now we can give you £40
So my bro thought no, they dropped my phone or something and quite rightly he just rejected the offer. Music magpie sent the phone back to him and awaiting the return My bro was concerned at what state he was going to receive the phone back, it’s was pristine when he sent it off and it was well packaged so it wouldn’t get damaged in transit. When he opened the box and the phone inside was perfect…..perfect!! No damage at all!
So why did music magpie tell him that it was broken?? To mislead and scam him into taking the £40 and not pay him what the phone was worth
So you guys really need to be aware this company isn’t honest and I wonder how many more people have they tried this on with, I just hope and am quite worried vulnerable people are going to fall for this scam. And now I have gone through emails left by other reviewers it clear to see they only answer good reviews which absolutely says a lot

Shameless and appalling"

Edit: Eventually got a repair date, but only by physically going to our local Currys and getting help from Customer Service. Very helpful. The repair guy that came out to the job was wonderful too.

Little we knew what is waiting! Date 16 Sept 2019, the tv came home screen cracked on right hand side screen, panel damaged and wouldn't turn on! Well, not the end, called up customer service (everytime min 20 mins wait) and explained situation. First answer, team knowhow can't do anything as repair team received tv in damaged condition. I was finding it hard to convince with all sensible logics (check the report of pick up guy, check my complian it's for a shadow not cracked screen, call up the pick up guy and ask, check when the tv was turned on). The report of pick up guy is all proof that there was no damage when we handed over! Anyway team knowhow asked me to resend the tv for investigation. Date 17 sept 2019, another pick up guy comes and pick up the tv. This time he mentions in report tv screen cracked!!
Date 20 Sept 2019, I receive a message tv will be sent back unrepaired and explanation would be given. Called up customer care, clearly mentioned I want a replacement give me a new tv or reimburse my purchase price upon producing receipt. I am asked to fill up an appeal form in pc currys after receiving the tv. The appeal may take months to be reviewed...I mentioned too that I don't want the tv to be delivered but help apply for appeal as I am already accused of giving a damaged tv!!! With no fault I have to go through this rigorous process with no tv at home...YES,
My only fault was I gave the TV to team knowhow (as tv was on extended warranty) to check for any defect."

The lady behind the desk in the Argos bit said she could do nothing without a receipt.
I explained the family are split family and the child’s mother never sees the dads family.
She gave me what I thought were Argos contact details to explain about the faulty goods so the item could be replaced or a credit note be given. I have just spent the last hour on the phone and searching the website for an email address. Like the woman yesterday phoning s no good without a receipt.
I am going to write a letter although I m not sure which of the two addresses is the right one.
I find all of this very stressful and unacceptable Argos.

167877,"Horrible customer service. Do not get a phone through Carphone Warehouse. As part of my offer it stated that I would receive £150 cashback after I traded in my phone. I did not receive any confirmation of my trade-in having gone through on the day, so the day after I called CPW. The lady I spoke to told me I will get information about how to do a trade-in when my contract phone arrives, I explained I had already done this which I was told was wrong and just do it again when the phone arrives and it will still track against my order. When nothing arrived with the phone about how to claim it, nor did I have any email to advise how to claim it, I assumed I must've been wrong and re-did the trade-in online (I was unwell so this was about a week later but I wasn't concerned as I was told it would link up). However, despite them having received my trade-in phone, a second phone call querying my missing £150 and being told it would be paid shortly (at this point I was given a tracking number, which I had to request in order to prove it was being dealt with), I have only recieved £45 of the £150 I should have.

After yet another email, I was then told I was not entitled to the £150 because it was not done at the same time as the contract (which it was, I just happened to not receive an email to prove it - which seems dodgy to me). I was also advised this: ""You can also go onto our website under your Samsung22 and click on ""view deals"" you will see we do not have a deal like that there"".

Luckily on the day of ordering the phone I print screened the offers just incase something went wrong. I have since been ignored having sent this through as proof. I ordered the phone end of September and here we are 2 months later and I have not received what I am owed.

DO NOT USE CARPHONE WAREHOUSE. They will screw you over"
127184,"This is the third time I've used Envirofone and they continue to offer a honest, reliable service. Due to the festive period I hadn't received my pack after 7 days however customer service sent another and I was able to provide my phone in time for the full price quoted. No issues. Great service."
101920,"Very good company, very pleased"
153425,"I am very pleased with my purchase of a Mac Mini.
The condition is very good and delivery was very speedy."
184345,"Wonderful product, easier, life changing"
148997,"Do not use these, I had the same as the other reviews, they come back saying the phone was‘nt in good enough condition (it’s pristine, even in the Apple Store the advisor told me it was one of the best conditions for a phone of that age) avoid these lot like the plague. If your reading this review, you should try to be more ENVIROmental PHONE conscious"
171723,"Excellent quality products. Easy to use website to design and order items.
Only downside is for one order that I placed it was delivered in 4 separate packages, which is a nuisance if having to keep collecting from Royal Mail depot etc."
196231,Brilliant will use them again 🙂
187788,Helpful nature of GTech staff in resolving a technical problem including supplying replacement part. Painless
188893,Great products purchased at great prices. Bought the 6 year Supercare warranty. 6 years later had my warranty refunded in full as no claim made. Refund arranged by Paul Meaney via email. Great company and easy to deal with. Would strongly recommend Richer Sounds.
175631,"Everything was first class. The offer I got for my phone was fair, the package to send the phone off came quickly and payment was swift. After being treated appallingly by Carphone Warehouse, Mazuma Mobile came up trumps. I can’t recommend them more highly."
150408,"Very prompt, no frills delivery. Phone in v good condition and supplied with charger, as stated. I would recommend envirofone to anyone looking for excellent value in 'previously loved' phones."
152668,"good product, exactly as described and worked perfectly, at a good price, but delivery was very slow."
102871,Driver drove right past the location and then apparently left the order somewhere else. Deliveroo basically didn't care.
150023,"Imagine confirming with 5 different people, including from the Value team, that you are entitled to compensation worth £8/day once the fault is closed and we leave contract.
Now imagine you are closing the account after you for a text that the fault is fixed. You then call to claim and the dude in customer service laughs at you and says ' you have no chance mate'.

Am I loving in a parallel world where contracts mean nothing? Or is this just the BT world?"
191031,One phone call requesting a replacement part. Replaced under warranty and delivered next day.
133688,Order was wrong (got someone else) nothing like what I ordered this is after waiting nearly 3 hours for it to come will not use again
191123,Easy to upload photos for the collage. Good quality and speedy service
127162,"Same day postige, very helpful, great service 👍👍"
168874,"Great service, part arrived quickly and well wrapped. I had cocked up and ordered the wrong memory for my mac so had to send it back - the return process was seamless and free with no questions asked and the refund was processed quicker than promised. Would definitely recommend."
102741,"Simply... HMV have got it right. Their tech means I can find even the most obscure albums online while their shop in Newbury offers the human experience of collecting them a few days later from helpful, efficient staff."
174658,"Always great quality prints, good value for money and always dispatched quickly. Have used Snapfish on many occasions for prints and photobooks."
112563,"Excellent service with good communications ensuring smooth delivery of our new appliance.

We can highly recommend Hughes - they have a broad range of electrical goods in terms of manufacturer, design, price and suitability."
190757,"I was slightly worried I'd left ordering a new phone for the teenager's Christmas present too late with all the strikes. However, I shouldn't have worried. Phone was easy to order and came up on Uswitch as the best deal. It arrived 24 hours after ordering with regular updates letting me know it was on its way. Great service, easy to order and I'd definitely recommend."
199111,"Update 27 Dec
Matter is finally resolved. Problem was Open Reach not BT. In fairness BT is making efforts at improving service. More UK call centres.

When BT works it good, however trying to BUY anything or fix a fault...an appalling company at communication.

BT told me it was upgrading my land line to digital. Lot of countdown emails and then done.....NOT.
The people who send marketing emails do not talk to others.
Result land line crackles, then dies for weeks. Now works on the old system , but cuts the broadband off.
Time to renew as your discount is ending. NO you cant until we have processed your order. The order is with Open Reach not BT, so not our problem."
129837,"Its a completely frustrating experience. I have been on the phone with them for over an hour to complain on a washing machine which i have bought care plan. First time they replaced it and the installation team delivered a poor installation job. They did not level it properly and were rushing to leave as soon as installation were done. As a result of bad installation, its broken my floor and other appliance due to the continuous movement of washing machine. Few weeks past, On the phone again to report the issue with another fault. Guy on team know how doesnt have much information and every time goes back toc check with his colleagues. On the phone for an hour to report a faulty washing machine. Finally wanted to return the washing machine and care plan back to currys and get the refund. Still on the phone for over an hour now and just holding. so not happy with the service and will not recommend team know how service to any one.

On a side note, the guy was continuously asking me the delivery date for the replaced washing machine. I asked him if it was stored on their system, he said no. Im confused what sort of order management system they are using with out storing any customer events. Im loosing confidence on them absolutely terrible company and service. If i go to the shop to report anything as a result of over an hour of phone waiting time, they just simply wash their hands and ask me to stick to phone system as product is not purchased from shop.

ok. so waited over an hour on the phone. Guy said he is checking with his colleague. But finally disconnected me after 1 hr 7 mins. My reference no is 91483615. Team Know how at least show some decency to respond to the customers asked to hold the phone. Im feeling that team know how knows how to steal the money. Can you contact me to resolve the issue."
192355,Ordered a phone on the 20th March which they advertised as in stock. They could not deliver or give me a despatch date. Following a few e-mail exchanges I decided to cancel my order and asked for a refund. They were not keen but confirmed that they would cancel order and issue refund. To this date 10/6/2020 I have still not received the refund despite their confirmation that refund has been processed. So unless you are happy to have no phone and no money back DO NOT purchase anything from this company.
119755,Had it Installed a few months ago as preparing for a new home after renovations to the house bought. Alarm and cameras work on WiFi and there will be three teenagers eventually moving in. So far all is good but the rest will come when we all move in together . I would like to know how to set up guest WiFi so the kids only have access to that and I can control the times it’s available
109787,I was able to compile a book of photographs from my Sons wedding to keep in my handbag.
126573,After applying for said phone and online being agreed . I then had to phone carphone warehouse to actually find out if I had the contract. To find out the hold up was that they needed more information. So once I'd done that my new phone came. Then traded my old phone in which I thought I could get more money on eBay but stuff it the money will buy me out of my old contract do that will do. 2 weeks later I heard nothing back from them so had to chase them again. To be told there was a fault with my phone. Asked what the said fault was they said there look into it.... Now 3 weeks in and I'm still chasing them with zero help. So my advise is ONLY SHOP IN THE SHOP
135894,"If there was a choice of zero, would've given that. My washing broke down 3 weeks ago, called team know how and reported the repair. They transferred me to Hotpoint the manufacturer. Git an engineer appointment a week later. Engineer came and confirmed the washing machine bearing gone, need to replace the bearing. He ordered the parts and bookian appointment 1 and a half week later. On the day of the appointment my engineer cancelled the appointment due to sickness. How amazing. I was given another appointment a week later. By then I have waited nd waisted 3 weeks of the repairs, my Laundry bill come upto £50. For something I'm insured of. I have a family of five and my machine has been broken over 3 weeks. After all the misdirection and misinformation from team know how. I went direct to Curry's to sort out the issue. As I went there I was served by an amazing agent, I was promised I will get an replacement because it has passed 7 day's repairs promise. I waited 3 days to hear and receive my voucher. Nothing. So I called them again, once again another error, I was told the replacement wasn't submitted to the manufacturer I'm gonna have to wait another 72 Hours. 72 Hours have passed no voucher no washing machine. Please team know how. Stick to your insurance policy. What is the point of insurance if I'm not getting the promise and service. It's been a month I'm without a washing machine. Very disappointed. Would never buy any product from them. Terrible service, fake policy. I'm going to sue the company now. Have enough"
117573,"This isn’t a company it’s a scam, over 10 months I’ve been waiting for a refund, same cut and paste response, but last few months not even that no response at all, I hear they’ve been visited by trading standards…. How on earth are they allowed to carry on trading and stealing our money, it’s theft pure and simple, in my case I never even received a phoned after the first 4 failed dates to deliver I cancelled my order and still no refund, do not use at all"
114933,Bought a second hand lens - delivered promptly and lens was just as described. Will definitely consider buying a second hand lens from Wex in the future
124638,"The problem is that it is not even worthwhile to tell them. They know it. Their service is so bad it makes a mockery of being a service. They are only good at one thing: Taking people's money.
When there is a fault, they put out all these messages about how much they care and how hard they are working to connect you. All rubbish, pre-baked marketing phrases. The reality is that customers are numbers and all they want is our money in exchange they give us extremely poor service. My latest experience began 17/11/2022, it is still going on. Disgraceful."
168512,"Excellent service from start to finish! Began with an online price comparison for the AEG integrated fridge freezer I wanted. Marks Electrical came up as having the best price and additionally I got my Blu Light NHS discount of 10% off the product. I checked the product out on their website, then called them as my kitchen is on the first floor and as I wanted the fit new and remove old appliance service and they needed to give me a price that.
The charges were reasonable given the need for 2 person delivery and fitting/removal. This was the best decision I made as although I’m fairly handy getting the appliance up the stairs as well as the fitting requiring a degree of skill and adjustment that would have taken me all day rather than the hour the fitter took.
I can say unreservedly:
I am delighted with the product,
the assistance over the phone of the sales person Peter,
the subsequent email communications re delivery
and the actual delivery, fitting and removal service provided by Zsolt and his assistant Stanislav."
156586,Absolutely atrocious... Engineer is coming out (this will be the 3rd time in 2 weeks) and STILL no internet. Was due to go live on the 6th April. To no avail. In the middle of a lockdown yet have no access to internet. Thank God for unlimited data from Giffgaff or i'd be screwed. It's frustrating to say the least AND being expected to pay for it. Awful. Avoid at all costs!
150631,"Easy to order online, with secure payment and fast delivery. Delivery man couldn't have been anymore helpful, first class employee! Excellent service all round."
175463,"Appliances Direct has been an absolute breeze to use/to deal with; kept me informed at every step of the order: timely, efficient, friendly, seamless, etc, etc, etc. The only supplier I could find before christmas to install the oven before christmas - so essentially, Appliances Direct saved christmas!"
168880,I had experience with mobile direct its great company to help
195021,"Paid for some filters and got an order confirmation.
Items not delivered and no communication after 10 days.
Contacted BuySpares.co.uk via online chat and was told the items were out of stock.
Why did they sell me the items when they were out of stock ?
Why did they not inform me they were out of stock ?
They've just been sitting on my money.
I've asked for a refund, not sure how long I'll have to wait for that :(
Please note that it did not show the product as ""out of stock"" in the checkout page as the order was placed"
158279,"Absolutely awful. CityFibre says TalkTalk FullFibre is available at said address TalkTalk Webchat say computer says no. First the agent claims to want to report to superiors, but then ends Webchat asking the customer to report it themselves to a hotline. Useless company."
117342,Great service thanks! And arrived in time for Xmas. When ordering a capture card please ensure customers know that they need a k60 pro to enable capturing with Xbox series x in 120htz. Thanks

I was served by Gavin who explained some options and answered all my questions, great staff and store.
Thank you"
175161,"What a terrible customer service process you have set up!!!
Purchased a washing machine towards the end of November, it literally blew the motor, door lock and electronic board on 10th January.
Surprisingly I managed to speak to someone from customer the next day to organise a visit from an engineer.
17th January the engineer from a contracted company (he was great) attended to do his report.
To this date I have still not had any any response from customer care and neither have the engineers.
I have called numerous times and been cut off after being in hold for sometimes up to 26 minutes and these are not free phone numbers, I have emailed aswel to which that was pointless as they tell me to go back to the phone line option for an engineer!!
The amount this has cost me in phone calls and trips to the launderette every other day, I could have purchased a new one."
125710,Quick delivery of a well packaged battery at a very good price.
187221,Got a lot of matches. Found the perfect trainer!

When eventually got phone was told couldn’t keep old number due to having a vodaphone number and moving to a new Vida phone Contract !"
104385,Really nice call handlers. Joely was especially quick and understanding. Hope my RMA comes out well as I’m gutted my monitor has conked out!

Otherwise happy enough good job the spring was not broken
Tip don't throw anything away until you have it all reassembled and working."
187429,"Bought the Dali Oberon 5 speakers, absolutely stunning, can’t rate them high enough, I’m hearing parts of songs I’ve never heard before, goosebumps through certain tracks, fantastic product at a fantastic price."
131048,The quality of the calendars was poor and they arrived a little scuffed up. The hole to hang the calendar was roughly cut and was through the pictures - which wasn't apparent when the preview image was shown.
185927,Upgraded my iMac from 8Gb of RAM to 32Gb of RAM. Competitive pricing and really fast delivery. Used instructional video on Mr Memory website too. Couldn't have been simpler .... and what a difference to performance !
178973,I got flyers in the post and in the paper about the Gtech K 9 and decided to buy one. I phoned in my order and was astounded to receive my hoover in less than 24hours. My husband put it together and I charged the battery. It is extremely light and easy to use and am delighted with my purchase.
191452,Really cheap part and delivered quick. Defo be back. Good installation video too.
185020,"Team Know How is the worst left me for a month in the pandemic with no laptop to work from home. Rang them 4 times been on hold for hours and no response just cut me off !!! Terrible customer service, and no one informed me my laptop is unrepairable until I reached out to them on Twitter and they said it would take 3-5 days for an e-voucher to be generated, however on the track it tab it still says in progress. I don’t have a clue what’s going on so went into my local store who were just as useless. What is the point of paying for a service if there is no service provided especially in times like this. Disgraceful!"
196274,The motor packed up on our 22 month old Gtech Airram so I phoned Gtech on Saturday morning and a new chassis with motor arrived the following day Sunday free of charge. Unbelievably good customer service. There are few honest companies around these days but Gtech is at the pinnacle of the best.
180939,Website easy to use. Quick service. Excellent delivery which was free on a Saturday. Good value for money on our fridge freezer and very competitive price. Would use Hughes again and recommend them.
127203,I know they are not the cheapest but they are the best hair straighteners I’ve ever used. Delivery was really quick and goods arrived very well packaged.
140064,"Was supposed to be a christmas present ordered ages before christmas, still not received on 28th December. Maybe the site isn't as trustworthy as you would think. Zero customer service too, no phone number working due to Covid (you've had 2 years adapt) and also no reply to emails. Absolutely terrible service."
107775,Although the item was delayed in the post once received the transaction was processed quickly and payment received the same day
112324,"Absolutely disgraceful customer service. I contacted them to report several hairs found my food and an incorrect item and they completely refused to help and compensate me for my order. I did manage to get my refund eventually by using the automated process and uploading a picture, but I didn’t appreciate how I was spoken to and the poor customer service I received, they wasn’t even willing to help. My issue could’ve been resolved much sooner. And the fact I spoke to two customer service advisors and they both rude and unwilling to help. How can you refuse to compensate me when I’ve found a hair in my food??? And I have an incorrect item???? Absolute joke."
136637,"Purchased a fridge freezer from Curry’s on April 20th. Paid an extra £35 to have the doors reversed, to better suit our kitchen. Delivery was due on April 27th, between 3 and 7. We stayed in an empty house, as we have yet to move in, until 7 and decided that it wasn’t coming. We weren't notified of a reason as to why it wasn’t delivered. Phoned on Sunday and had it reorganised for the following day. Fridge delivered but without the doors reversed. Spent 45 minutes, through various calls, dealing with a total of 5 different people before being put through to the correct person to deal with the situation. Another date of May 4th reorganised for door reversal. It comes to May 4th and the appointment is cancelled as there isn’t anyone available, following a issue with another delivery. I am fuming and severely disappointed. I will be avoiding this company in the future."
116828,Elementary great service. My cooker element arrived quickly ad enabled me to fit it and be back in action asap.

185226,"I purchased cloud backup for a 5 year period, 2TB. The App reports I am over my 1tb limit for one section of the backup and haven't used any of the other 1TB limit. I was worried there was a problem but support just said it was a system glitch and it's been like that for 5 years. The android app is not user friendly, the Windows system tray app is just ticking over, refusing to backup 2 files for about the past year. I have bought a raid solution and do not want to renew now. I am told I am unable to cancel renewal as it is against company policy to ""prevent accidentally forgetting to renew"". In my opinion this is just a tactic to gain revenue from people who forget to cancel. I have to submit a request via an online form requesting the service to stop, this then happens within 24 hours of form submission, regardless of how much service left on the contract. Customer support, doesn't !. They just ""apologise"" and paste in the companies policy on they money making scheme (AKA no renewal cancellation). Utter rubbish, looked a good deal at the time. ""If it looks too good to be true, it probably is"" ain't that the truth!"
107047,Fast and reliable service. Any queries are sorted in a very professional and polite way. Thankyou Wex.

139822,A very easy process and a human being to talk to. How refreshing in this day and age. The goods were as described and for a very good price. Was told that I would receive a call back in 30 mins but was called within 10. An absolute pleasure to deal with.

136794,"I have used both the Stratford and Lakeside Team Knowhow Centres recently and service has been A+.

Lakeside dealt with my request professionally and Stratford exceeded all my expectations.

A word of advice for people intending to visit CPW locations for a repair; make sure you go to one with a Team Knowhow because the ones without these dont really know anything about repairs. I ended up losing my cool with the clowns in CPW Thurrock when they insisted I had damaged my phone that had screen burn in."

147421,"Upgraded my phones in the past 3/4 months with a lady called Sandra, can only describe the lady as awesome. If theres a problem she finds a solution which in customer facing roles is the important part. Friend of mine had a massive issue with o2 direct. Picked him up drove to the store, half hour later he has his new phone and commented how easy it was. Cant speak highly enough of this team, they are all fantastic, this is simply the reason i have used this store for the best part of 20 years. If you want a good deal this is the place to go. Mention to James the manager also he helped give clarity to a situation which always helps. Top team keep up great work"

It’s a constant struggle to stop Shell trying to gouge you by unnecessarily raising your direct debits. Up to my eyes with listening to piffle about their algorithms!

Anyway hats off to Bojana, she actually listened to what I had to say, unlike the usual robots reading from their scripts! Incidentally, I have resolved the attempted gouging by cancelling my direct debit!!"

It took me 4 hours and speaking to about 6 different people yesterday to cancel my account - they don't make it easy. Now they will likely provide an online link so I can open a complaint that will be ignored along with the rest. No thank you - other options out there."
198722,I only use these for broadband as I use Netflix etc for watching but I’ve been with them for around 3-4 years now. I’ve never had a problem with my internet and it’s always been kept at a low price. It’s a shame they can’t do a faster broadband than super fibre though as it’s be better for gaming.
124534,"My overall experience with the website, ease of building a custom computer, selecting parts and ordering was fantastic, there was no communication required for this process; the quality of parts seem fine as of now, the build itself is very clean and the build time was very short, especially when accounting for the backlog of graphic cards currently.

The delivery was straight forward, well secured packaging and delivered within a satisfactory time.

I initially had issues with my build which seemed to point towards software related issues, which is a bit unfortunate straight out of the box however I contacted PCspecialist's technical support and speaking with a member of their support team, going through the issue and following the directions provided, as well as additional steps taken by myself, it thankfully seems to be resolved.

The technical support responded very quickly after opening a support ticket, the advice was thorough, clear and concise; shout out to Dylan for the excellent customer service and support."

Once again, after some wait, I was connected to some in South Africa. However, this time, after going through the security checks, I was told that the home address that I gave was not correct and he couldn't help me.
(rather perturbing asI have lived there for over 40 years).
Having had enough of Carphone Warehouse's non existent customer service, I called Vadafone customer services.
At this point, it was 5:30pm and I have been without a phone for almost 2 working days.
I eventually, talked to a gentleman who after checking Vodafone's system told me that the sim given to me at the Carphone Warehouse store, hadn't been registered to my account and so, wasn't going to connected at anytime.
Even though all this had been caused by Carphone, the Vodafone chap advised me that if I could get to the Trafford Centre before 8pm (1 & 1/4 hours away), he would call the store and arrange to get a new sim in-store and my number transferred to it.
I left a very unimpressed client for a a mad dash across country but @ 7:30pm, I eventually had a working phone......until today......
At 11am my sim stopped working. I went to Vodafone Wilmslow they told me that on the 8th Sept, Carphone Warehouse had, instead of just cancelling the 1st sim, had also cancelled my new contract (apparently, they had registered is as if I have returned the sim within the 2 week period).
Luckily, Dan with the help of the customer service team, was able to save my number of 15+ year by transferring 1st to a pay as you go sim, then once the humber was safely ported to this, to a new contracted sim. However, this took till 4pm due to the logistical workings of doing this I am still without a working phone until tomorrow morning. He also, advised me to write to OFCOM as cancelling a contract without a clients request should be brought to their attention.
All this has cost me 3 + days work, hours of travelling, and many very unhappy clients. All because of one badly run company.
I feel sorry for the employees of Carphone Warehouse, especially the ones who tried to help me in-store because my experience will not be isolated and I can imagine that they have to deal with these issues often. Lack of investment, training, poor technology and a disjointed structure has only its executives to blame."
190384,"The delivery drivers in the two times we have used this service have been extremely helpful and professional. The customer service/schedulers on the other hand are abysmal and will lie straight to your face to get you off the phone.

The first washing machine to arrive was smashed to bits, so the driver took it away and the delivery was rescheduled. Bearing in mind people have to take days off to be at home and the only days they can deliver (Mon and Thu for our area), means a second day off of work.

Delivery was promised for the afternoon of the following Monday (something customer service said was more than possible). We then received a text on the preceding Sunday saying it would arrive ""0700-1059"". Funnily enough having booked the afternoon off this wasn't going to work. A quick call to customer service and a boy told us not to worry; he couldn't change the delivery timing right then, but if we phoned back Monday morning at 0800 they could re-shuffle the delivery. Considering the delivery timing start at 0700 we questioned this - ""oh the drivers don't come in until 0800 anyway."" Sounded fishy but what can you do?

Monday morning comes and 0755 we get a call from the driver saying he's minutes away. After explaining what we'd been told he said he'd heard nothing and that they start work at 0630.

Turns out both times we'd called customer service we'd been lied to just to get us off the phone.

Unfortunately the drivers are forced to deal with this cluster and went out of their way to re-shuffle their delivery route to cover for the failings of the customer service office. A shame that they are let down and have to face the disappointed customers whilst those in the office hide away.

In summary, would not recommend relying on this service for consistency or reliability (or the truth). If you can use someone else, do it. But if you take the gamble, once it does arrive it will be installed correctly and to a high standard."

159012,"Ordered wedding thank you cards with a photo from our wedding. When we had the cards back they were too dark. Optimal print had darkened the original photo (which I thought was just in the editing mode), and the enhancing tool only had a an even darker option.

Update:- since posting the original view above and giving 2 stars Optimal Print have been in touch and offered a full refund so I have amended the review to reflect this to 4 stars"

At first the so-called delivery driver couldn't find my address, so in the end I went on to their website and gave instructions to drop it off at the depot. He did not. It's still with him. The so-called courier. The joke shop company I'm referring to is Yodel. You might want to change your courier to a more reputable company. I should have received it Monday. It is now Thursday."
172149,"i bought a fridge freezer, price was excellent nd ease of ordering was too. It was delivered on the correct day and I was kept informed throughout, so far so good. I was contacted to say that the delivery cost would be removed if I was willing to accept a call asking my opinions- I accepted however this has not taken place nor the money returned, not my fault so I am disappointed with that. The delivery guys were on time however extremely abrupt and left an filthy mess on my carpet where they dragged the appliance in- not impressed at all. I have used ao.com twice in recent weeks, both times ao.com service has been excellent however the delivery provided on both occasions was absolutely rubbish."

104803,"Edited review 05/12/22
I have upped my review to 4 stars after finally getting a response 3 weeks from my original query from Jetal at Marks Electricals. My point has now been addressed.

Original Review 01/12/2022 - 3 stars
For price of the equipment I would give 5 stars.

Customer service is what has made me give a lower score. I bought a heat pump tumble dryer and selected installation as never owning one before and their being the option for installation I thought there would be something to it. In reality, I paid £35 for someone to put a plug in a socket and turn it on. I raised this to Marks Electrical by email on the 20/11 and haven't had a response. I additionally phoned them on the 27/11. I got through, they said they would ask their supervisor and call me back. I still haven't heard anything."
170818,"My talktalk internet failed due to talktalk router breaking. They initially wanted to schedule their own engineer in two weeks time to come out (yes two weeks!).
Then engineer came out and told me needed new router, so had no internet for 6 days.
They compensated me, manager personally phoned and dealt with complaint closure, assured me I would have no charge next month.
Next months bill arrived, and instead of no charge they nearly doubled it. They sneakily added in an Engineer charge of £65. So on one hand, they compensated me for, in their words “Poor quality of service”, when with the other charging me an engineer call out fee of £65 - that’s after confirmation that fault at their end!

Wait - it gets worse. After hassle of no service, and then incorrect bill, I’ve now spent nearly 4 hours over two days trying to correct the bill. The online chat is useless, after 2 hours and a manager finally phoned to say bill would be corrected, the bill hasn’t been updated and manager left no notes.
Now after numerous calls yesterday, where customer billing department are unable to correct bill, and it has to go to technical department who then have to pass to a manager who then has to pass to billing department who then don’t do anything I end up here and frustrated and wishing talktalk out customer first."
160538,"Great service, brilliant condition used product and quick delivery!

Can never fault Wex at all."
135684,No problems with this collection. Staff were very helpful
186573,"Thieves. Their website allowed me to order AND PAY for a phone that was never in stock to begin with. They then sent out a confirmation email with the promise to get in touch should there be any problems. THREE WEEKS later, and still with no phone or tracking update, I phoned them to see what was going on only to be told there was no longer a manifacturer for that phone. But that they had taken my money with no actual thought to get in touch to return it - for three weeks, until I went to them. How long, if at all, would it have taken, would they have kept my money for? Had they told me immediately, I would have chosen another phone within the Black Friday deals, or I would have kept my partners old phone rather than the old and broken one I am left with now. Instead, they took a large sum of money from me for a phone they never had to begin with, with no evidence that -without my asking - they would have even returned the money to me. And all they could then offer me over the phone were MORE EXPENSIVE versions of my purchase for lesser value phones. Appalling customer service and company standards."
128884,I’ve used the company many years ago and always been excellent in service. I sent in my Iphone SE which was in immaculate condition. Originally offered £90 to then be told the camera lens has black spots so knocked down to £35! After reading these negative reviews it’s interesting how many other people have been told the same thing and had a reduced price on their phone. I accepted the offer as after reading more of these reviews the likelihood is that i would end up paying for the phone to be returned. My partner was going to use the company to sell his phone but after this experience will be using another company.
143215,Absolutely shocking customer service. Firstly their call lines are horrendous quality so you cannot hear what they are saying. It took me 3 attempts to cancel and order after they had told me each time the order was cancelled. The refund had not come through after 12 days despite being promised 3-5 working days so I had to call again only for the service line to hang up 3 times before getting through to someone. Would not recommend their service at all they are overpriced and offer shocking customer support
112770,"The worst Customer service with a never ending admin loop and the most generic copy and paste replies with no accountability or communication.

Order two items on black Friday of which neither arrived due to logistical confusion with Yodel the courrier. Proceeded to request a cancellation with Currys and a return with yodel. It has been over a 6 weeks since the purchase and a month since the refund request. Currys will not refund me until they receive confirmation the items have been returned by their courrier... I have spoken to the courrier who says the items have been sent back. Over 20 conversations with Currys live chat and over the phone customer support to repeat the same scripted answers ""we escalated this to our accounts department"" etc. Overall breaches all feasible distance seeling laws, consumer rights act of 2015 etc. Not once have I received an update from Currys. Section 75 here we come as the fact that I have to pursue a refund for items I never received is beyond me... Avoid!"

I will definitely be using Plugin Boutique to purchase any other plugins that I may want in the future.

Highly Recommended.

133088,"I bought my new iPhone under the cash back scheme.
Payment made with a promise I would get £130 back after inspection.

I have to say the delivery of the new phone was fast and I was actually very impressed. However it took 12 days for the envelope to return my old phone to arrive. I used the enveloppe to return it. Surprisingly 1 week later still no news - I checked the tracking they did receive it 4 days earlier. I did email them to receive few days later an answer saying my phone got inspected and from £130 it would go down to £30 as apparently my screen was broken. I guess they must hear that all the time but my screen was intact !!!!!!!!! I emailed them back to ask for pictures as it left flawless. No answer. I emailed them back twice to ask them to return my phone. Still no answer. I am now a phone kept against my will, no refund and a customer service that ignores my request.

There are few words to describe such behaviour : scam !

It is a shame to think that in 2021 you have to leave negative feedback to warn potential buyers"
160800,"I honestly don't often write reviews and I consider myself a very easy going person but Vodafone are just cowboys. I've never experienced a company fight so hard to avoid making a refund after admitting they'd over charged a customer. 4 times I've contacted their customer care team being passed around departments but finally being told to come back at another randomly generated date. I've been in touch with Vodafone since late August regarding a inaccurate over due balance on my account and each time, we're ""waiting"" on something else before they can refund me. I've paid £80 a month (armed forces discount included) for the last 2 years for genuinely sub par connectivity and now a hassle even refunding errors they acknowledged making.
I've moved over to EE who offered a better military discount and don't regret it. I won't be using these highwayman again."

The action camera was grade B but itself indistinguishable from new, just a part of the box was missing. The plastic stickers over the lenses and screens were all still intact. Will certainly use CEX again for future purchases. The packaging is also fully recyclable, and delivery was prompt and reliable. Very impressed."

151215,Had no broadband connection from the 28/09/2022 -21/10/2022. Despite numerous visits from engineers problem still wasn't fixed. Got a credit to my account for engineer no show & a £20 courtesy payment as I had no internet. Was told I would get £8 a day for having no service. BT are now disputing this!!!! They obviously don't communicate with each other. Cancelled my service with them & received a letter confirming this. According to BT I am still with them? The company is an absolute joke. Please please avoid. They don't give a damn about their customers. 🤬🤬🤬
155206,If i could leave no stars if I could I have mentle health problems and I recieve pip was tricked into another contract tried to get help because rising fuel costs the government dwp said I'm entitled to cheaper Internet but BT said I was not told them to cancel everything as I can't afford 70 odd pounds a month was told I will have to pay 1200.00 contract fees really i cant afford the 70 odd quid a month the horrible customer services they like over talking you when your talking which affects my mental health and I lose it when I phoned about to get help reduce my bills with the help I'm ment to be entitled to all and every adviser all they were interested in is the 2 months bill I owe I advised these nasty rude BT customer services the week before that I can't pay there bill as because high costs of living and I'm struggling like many others are they just want money and they have no sympathy for anyone struggling iv a choice pay there high price Internet I just have Internet no phone or sit in the cold and freeze I would advise anyone choose another provider
161051,"I am not sure of the man that helped me at Kettering’s Carphone Warehouse, he had very dark hair and short beard and apparently had worked there for quite a while but he was amazing. He had so many people waiting to be served by him as he was the only member of staff in that area but he did not look or act stressed and did not hurry me. He made sure I knew about all the best mobile phone deals and made sure it was the best one for me. I will definitely return when my phone needs renewing and have recommended him to all my friends!! He is a credit to Carphone Warehouse and I think he should be rewarded for his dedication to his job and to the good name of CPW!! Thank you 😊"

184756,"Absolutely the worst experience I have had with any company over the last forty years. My router had failed, no power. It took the call centre in South Africa 3 hours to agree that I needed a replacement. All this time on the phone, even having been directed to another lien that was an error on TT's part. The lack of knowledge and process was very poor. I was asked question after question that did not relate to the power issue. I will be formally writing to various bodies about a company who `i have been with for over 20 years (Pipe/TalkTalk). When I stated I will be making a complaint, I was asked if I wanted to speak to a line manager. I asked if this was a direct connection, response, yes. Gave up after another fifteen minutes. I cannot explain enough how poor this service is."

155607,"I purchased a new Moto G9 sim free phone on Friday 21st May 2021 in store at the Kidderminster branch. I was asked to pick it up has late as possible on Monday the 24th May. I asked if the store could drop me a text or call to save me a wasted journey when it arrived ""no problem"".
I popped in at six, Curry's were open but not Carphone warehouse. So next day I rang I to check on my order. No one had been in touch as promised, I rang twice both calls dropped out automatically after a lot of music. Customer services said my phone was ready for collection.
In store was deserted with a few customers milling around, but no Carphone warehouse staff. I spoke to Jamie the Curry's Manager who explained both members of staff had called in sick and he wasn't able to get replacement staff, saying that they were having trouble with staff mental health problems. So I rang customer service again who were shocked at both members of staff being off. I explained I wished to cancel my order, but was told it had to be done in store. How with no one there, so it's now in dispute with my credit card company.
I would give you no stars for this appalling service and wasting my time. ANYONE READING THIS BELIEVE IT, THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME TODAY..
UPDATE NEXT DAY.
I Phoned the Kidderminster store again, no answer. I know the phones are working because I rang them in store yesterday, I have to assume no staff showed up again. How can this level of service be possible for a company like this in 2021. I would expect some kind of response to this review, but responding to customers seems to be too much to ask of Carphone warehouse.
UPDATE 27TH MAY
Still no reply to the phone so I called Curry's instead they were able to confirm the Carphone warehouse was staffed and my order was ready for collection. Trip number four, I asked if the guy at the counter worked there, he had no ID on or uniform.
I explained I had been messed around and wanted my money back. At this point he went off to get a manager to refund me. Which involved them having to test a brand new phone for faults on a computer they use to test trading in phone (bizarre)
The Manager asked if I would like a different Phone? ""No I don't want anything from this store"" he then asked if a discount would temp me to keep the Phone ? But he a manger had to ask another manager to authorise it, Ten pound off. I replied saying I wanted a refund.
I would suggest anyone should use any other vendor than these Clowns."

I have been a customer with mobile broadband for years and decided to take advantage of a cheaper new contract and had to pay £19 for the router. I never received the router as wasn't in to receive it so it went back to Three in March. I have spoken to numerous people and keep getting emails from the complaints dept asking for various info which I send but they say they can't find my details. I have even sent a bill I received with a £19 credit on but still they ask for more. I have now given them 7 days to resolve or I will take further. I tried to cancel my current service with them as moved over to another provider but I received an email to ring them. Very poor customer service

g) that the variable DD debit will be properly applied always therefore leaving a zero balance on my account after it has been applied to the current bill , taking into account and government assistance.

183766,"Bought an iPad 5 months ago which was grade B, then it suddenly stopped charging and would crash when not connected to power. Spent all day trying to get my data off the iPad to take down to store only to be told it was bent and couldn’t be replaced or repaired as per their own warranty.

I couldn’t even see any damage, and the item had been in a case since the day I bought it so I was very confused. Tried to contact the online team (as I bought it online) and they refused to give me any sort of specifics to my case. Wouldn’t comment on the photos I sent through, couldn’t answer the original grading report which gave the original damage and just kept repeating any physical damage voids the warranty.

I understand if it was clearly dropped or covered in scratches but it was an imperceptible bump or ‘bend’ as they called it with no other damage. I just find it hard to understand how a second hand item is allowed no physical damage if it develops a fault.

Bought the item due to the tempting two year warranty, but they will try and not honour it by any way possible!! Wouldn’t buy anything else again from this company

Edit - this is exactly what I mean with the repetition of policy. No one from the online team is willing to assess my item or even comment on the pictures I sent. I’d be happy to send it away but you don’t want to know. As I’m having a battery issue it wouldn’t be unreasonable to experience some swelling and distortion of the casing, especially when I have absolutely no other damage visible (which I’ve sent proof of). Just feels to me warranty is for show only and there’s been no attempts to help my issue"

156713,"Do not bother! This has been an absolute headache. I had items missing from my delivery and it has taken a week of lies before I have finally decided to just get refunded. All their customer support agents say is 'sorry for the inconvenience'. Spoke with 4 agents. 3 of which told me they ordered me new parts - they hadn't. One agent even questioned me suggesting I was lying about recieving my order even after a previous agent told me they rescheduled the delivery then he closed the chat. 2 agents confirmed they had scheduled new deliveries, only to find out 6 days later that the hadn't. Load of rubbish and will never use again."

Anyway, even without all the info they were asking for, they booked a check for Tuesday (so within 2 days). Engineer concluded that the drum needed replacing and it was done on the Thursday. Slightly irritated that the time window offered was 7.20am-11.20am which was a bit of an early start. And they arrived at 12. But the engineer seemed very competent and experienced and so far the machine is working OK."
138164,"I should have known better.

I have bought a number of phones from QMF in the past, and had to chase every one of them, but eventually have received the phone, albeit not working in the case of the first phone ordered.
Anyway, I went with them again for a replacement phone for my partner for her birthday. I ordered in the middle of February, so that it had plenty of time to arrive for the start of April. Guess what, it didn't! I have chased and chased, and look to have received the same spiel as other about COVID. I mentioned they must have had COVID for a long time in Romford, as they had the same hesitancy to send a unit back in 2019! I hope that I do receive the unit, but reading the reviews here, I'm not sure. I'm not even contemplating asking for a refund (even though they readily offering this to probably get me off their back!).

I definitely will never use them again, especially as there are others with a much better track record - avoid at all costs!

Update - Received a standard email from QMF saying they are sorry I want to cancel and that I should have a refund within 14 working days. It has taken numerous emails, nearly a month after they last replied to my emails, and also the threat of a legal interjection. Luckily, my bank have this issue in hand, so hopefully I will recoup some money as I have very little, if any, hope that QMF will send my money back to me. Incredible that they have seemingly been able to get away with this for so long!"

I took a contract out in February and the phone stopped working in July wouldnt charge the phone had totally died. I took it to carphone warehouse who said they'd send it of for repair. I gets a text phones ready go to the store was told sorry staff called in sick come back tomorrow, I got back the next day he said no noted to say what issue is he plugged the phone in to show me it charging alls good still had to pay my full bill even though I didn't have the phone. Fast forward a few weeks phone stops charging again books a repair and they was supposed to have it collected they were a no show... I emailed and got no where put a complaint in and was told I have a new screen on my phone ??? My warranty is void the engineer report said they didn't touch my phone so how come I handed a phone that was dead and wouldnt charge and collected a phone that did work and would charge. I havent touched my screen it's the same 1 I had all along so either the engineer broke my screen and replaced it or I was sold a phone that someone returned. All the time I'm still paying £50 for a phone that I cant use I have escalated my complaint told them I want a new phone and they can have this back I will go to the store with the cheap of rubbish I was sold so if your thinking of entering a contract please beware as you'll pay for something you cant use. I want a phone that works is this to much to ask and get to try bottom of lies about the screen if your technician done it or was I sold someone's return phone
** kash the only people that have had my phone is carphone warehouse why would I take it to someone else I only got it at the end of February it's in warranty **

133067,"Wanted to take advantage of promotional code provided by the company to obtain a £10 discount on my order. Couldn’t see the discount code box as I went through the payment process and assumed it would be on one of the final pages where I was asked to select “Continue”. However, instead of “continue”, it should more accurately have said “make payment” - which is what happened - at the full price. I went back through the payment process and found the words “Promotional Code” greyed out with a small arrow that revealed the box to put in the code. In my opinion, a very sharp business practice that I suspect catches a lot of people out."

Apparently, they think it's OK to make you pay for international phone calls. Guess why? Obviously, the more difficult the cancellation process, the less people are going to leave.

Now, that's not the end of the story... The person on the phone has just told me that I must return the BT Hub (it's how they call their router) to them, supposedly for recycling, despite me having received it several years ago, and promised, at the time, that after the first 18 months it would be fully mine."

161669,"I wouldn't even give them 1 - Do not sell to this company!
I sent a perfectly usable Surface Pro 6 to them in early November which they said had a water mark in the screen and reduced my offer from £323 to £34 after inspecting it.
I had owned this machine since new and was almost in perfect condition. I asked for it to be sent back to me as I could sell it elsewhere and It was posted back to me and arrived two days later.
When I opened the box (Which wasn't damaged) the laptop had a very badly damaged screen where it had clearly been dropped and then several significant scratch's right across the screen as if it has been dragged across the ground!
I contacted Music Magpie immediately (There is no customer service phone number) by email with photos of the damage and the standard email said it would take 5 days for a response.
After many emails backwards and forwards and with a delay of 4-5 days each time they have said they didn't damage the laptop it must have been like it - Their CCTV even shows the inspection area and they would have seen it dropped! Absolute rubbish!
Clearly it wasn't like it when it was sent to them or the inspection report would have shown this damage so it must have happened in their care.
I am furious, they have damaged my laptop beyond repair and a new one has cost over £800!
You can not speak to anyone and have to use email which they have now stopped responding too.
Please do not sell to them, you do not want this experience.
Update: 5 hours after their message and no email, all junk folders etc checked!"

My elderly mother (who is registered as vulnerable) has had no landline for 2 days. She lives alone and has no other means of contacting a doctor or hospital other than her landline. I was assured she would be listed as an emergency case, but still no resolve.
I’ve also been on the phone over the past 2 days for over 3 hours. I’ve had the phone answered by the call centre, and immediately put down This happened three times in a row. Once I would have said was an accident on their part, but three times?! I merely think they’re incompetent and can’t do their jobs.
In short if you have an elderly person that is reliant on their landline - do not touch Shell Broadband with a barge pole. They’re negligent, ignore their own Vulnerable Customer Policy, terrible at customer service and really do not care if their elderly customers died alone at home with no means of contacting anyone for help.
I’m still on hold waiting for someone to answer. Shell! Hell would be a more accurate description of this pile of jokers that seem to think they’re a professional telecom business."

Wouldn't give me a refund until I had the phone, wasn't travelling 2 hours back up to fetch a phone so asked order to be cancelled. Having to wait 14 days for bloody refund. Absolutely disgusting. Never ever will I shop with you again and I will advise anyone I know not to either. Quick enough to take money but getting it back takes ages. People can't part with this much money especially when a phone is needed for work so have to get another. You should be ashamed of yourselves......... 🤬"

158998,"***Update*** 14.12.2022
I got the usual BOT reply from Virgin Media regarding this matter, telling me that I should Contact VM to make a complaint. The BOT obviously doesn't know that you cannot log any complaint with VM until your service has been connected, this is a sneaky way by VM to get round the 6 week complaint resolution proccess that's required for the customer to escalate any complaint to Ofcom.

I took out my Virgin Media contract for their 1GB Fibre on the 2nd of November 2022. I was advised that a pre installation vist was required to bring the Fibre cable to my home and this would be completed by the 9th Nov with a home install of the Router by 28th Nov. Virgin's 3rd party contractor did not turn on the 9th Nov, but turned up on the 25th Nov and found an issue getting the Fibre cable into the BT wall port attached to my home and advised that a 2 foot,6 inch deep extension would be needed to give access to another part of the wall, this was 2 days before the Virgin engineer was booked to do the home install. Virgin then cancelled the engineer visit and advised the ground work would be done on the 30th and booked the engineer for 15th Dec , no one turned up on the 30th, I was advised it would be the 1st Dec, no one turned up, I was then advised it would be the 2nd Dec, no one arrived. On the morning of 5th Dec I received a change of date fir my engineer install booked for the 15th Dec to 28th January 2023!. I contacted Virgin's pre install team who previously had blatantly lied about the ground work dates and was advised the change of install was because of a Land Title permit issue to gain access to my home, after advising them I owned the home and the surrounding land and held the title, they changed that excuse to a Council permit to do the grounds work, I advised Virgin that my surrounding neighbours had in the previous month Virgin Media installed without any need for permits?, I advised them that the need for a permit was not required as the work needed was on my property and not on Council land, Virgin advised this was the notes on the system by the 3rd party contractor and could do nothing!..I then attempted to log a formal complaint with Virgin Media abd this request was rejected as Virgin could not apply any complaint on their system until the grounds work had been completed..what!, the complaint was about the grounds work!.. completly ridiculous process by Virgin Media. I have found on both Virgin Media Forums and other sites that this is happening to others, the 3rd party contractors used by Virgin Media are using the need for a permit as an excuse to not complete the work, many people are saying that a permit was never required to complete the work. Virgin Media's repretation is being damaged by allowing their 3rd parties to dictate when customers can get their installations completed by using the need for permits as a delaying tactic to do the work they need to do!. Virgin Media are required by Ofcom to provide compensation for each day of delay to install the service, Virgin Media will be required to compensate from 9th Nov 2022 till 28th Jan 2023 because their 3rd party contractors are simply lying to them, what company allows this to happen?, totally unacceptable to wait 3 months to dig a 2ft long and 6 inch deep trench which would take 10 mins to complete abd cost Virgin Media £100's in compensation, infact the compensation will be twice as much as the cost of my Virgin Media's 18 month contract??"
187808,I had an issue with the battery on my GTech I called the customer service and they sent a replacement which arrived the following day
179209,"Since signing up to NowTV Broadband 4 months ago, it has been a regrettable decision largely due to shockingly poor customer service and poor wifi (ongoing issues for 3 months). NowTV have sent 4 engineers out and each time promised they would enter the property to sort the issue. Each and every time they never came to the property instead opting to 'fix an issue' in the street nearby. So far, I have been promised 4 callbacks from 'managers' and received not one callback I was promised. The staff do not follow up their own callbacks and there is no communication between engineers and customer service advisors. The issue of dropouts and slow wifi has not been fixed since starting the contract in October 2020. There is no way of speaking directly to a supervisor when phoning the customer service line because apparently they do not have headsets."
143707,Excellent delivery time and GHD are brilliant. My last GHD which I have had for 13 years died so I wanted to quickly replace them. I didn't get an email to let me know that they had been posted but as they arrived quickly I was impressed. Thank you GHD.

199714,"Completely the wrong order was delivered on Thursday. At first I thought a bag was missing as the chicken and kebabs wee missing. But the driver did not have another bag. Forgetting a bag is a common oversight of busy drivers and understandable. The platform handles the refund of partial items well usually in my experience. But on this occasion when an order of probably less than £15 was delivered instead of my £68 order it did not. I reported this to support on the deliveroo website following their instructions. I had to upload a photo of the items delivered and was asked to include the receipt delivered with the food in the photos. No receipt was delivered with this order which partially explains the drivers confusion when I challenged him on the accuracy of my order. On Thursday the deliveroo customer service agent eventually agreed via chat that the wrong order had been delivered and offered to cancel my bank payment in full saying this would take 2 to 3 days to process. An hour later I receive a delivery email. You have been refunded £18.

I emailed back explaining this is not what was agreed and is insufficient. Today two days later I receive a terse email stating I need to supply photos. They clearly had not reviewed the case notes at all and were following the standard script. I responded in kind. Another terse, unhelpful, I'll thought out and devoid of any common sense email arrived. Demanding more photos of the order to show it was not what I ordered as suddenly I had failed to supply enough photographic detail and had not included an image of the receipt. The receipt which was not delivered, that I do not have. I enquired how I perform such magical time travel to photograph short life food that was thrown away two days ago and manifest a receipt from this vast intellect via email.

Conclusion never order from deliveroo again it's hopefully soon to enter administration through sheer incompetence and the rudeness of it's staff. I feel for the drivers he was the only one who apologized in all of this and I feel sure it was not his fault."

Ok cool, waste more time of a days annual leave! 18.45 received a call from CS saying the driver went out of hours!

Half a day wasted, terrible customer experience from the call centre who hung up on me on re deliver. Never again. Am I surprised ..... NO! £20 compensation - that is a days leave !! Not focused on an experience at all. Avoid at all costs."
193188,"Although I knew a fair bit about computer tech there were areas I was entirely ignorant about, such as the types of cooling required on different processors. With PC Specialist I was able to phone up an incredibly knowledgeable sales team who set me up with an incredible computer set up for gaming and video.

They communicated at every stage - in one instance the case I'd initially chosen was out of stock and I needed to pick a new one and again I was able to phone the team and sort out the issue with great ease.

When my PC arrived it was far better than I had even imagined. PC Specialists have done me proud and knowing that if anything does go wrong I can call them is a great comfort.

I would definitely recommend this company to anyone looking to build a custom setup or a pre-built model (as my friend did). These machines feel like quality and I will shop there again when this rig needs an upgrade.

Thanks PC Specialist for your time and excellent service!"
189314,I recently joined through Carphone warehouse business. As per network all PAC codes can be given once a network connects you with a new number. Guess what? Carphone warehouse are saying you cannot bring your old number once a new number is connected. They did not make this clear when I signed up for the contract now I’m really disappointed that they cannot bring my old number in I hope my network can help me here. Avoid this company for business contracts and sim only because it’s their mistake and they are not willing to help. All they are saying is pay off termination fee or keep the new number which is ridiculous.
139387,"ABSOLUTELY APPALLING SERVICE. I contact BT last week to set up a new account. The staff member set the account up incorrectly and never added the reward card so told me he would have to restart a new account process for me. This went through and the account was set up. As part of the package deal I was due to get Netflix, now TV and a £110 reward card. The Netflix transferred over correctly however the staff member but in the wrong email for the Now Tv which was the first issue. The second issue was I received an email stating I was ready to collect the rewards card. When I accessed my BT account to claim this there was 2 active accounts neither had the reward card up. I contacted BT where I was on the phone for a hour and was transferred to 3 different staff who stated I had 2 active accounts and they would cancel one for me. They did this with the account with the Netflix account and also stated that would sort the reward card. I asked that this was done correctly as I didn’t want to ring back and I was told it was. Within half a hour I was back on the phone to BT as all my accounts I was told via email was cancelled and they added £110 credit to my account. Again I was on the phone for a hour and was transferred through a number of staff where I had to repeat myself. I was told in relation to the Netflix issue I would get a call back on Friday and they would not be able to sort my reward card out until I was billed. On Friday I did not receive a call. I rang BT again on the Monday again I was transferred through to 3 different members of staff. I was told I wasn’t able to sort the issue with Netflix until my box arrived. I told the staff member this was incorrect as I already set it up previously on the other account so she had lied. The whole experience was exhausting and I had not even received any of the services."

I would only recommend people avoid this service!"
194779,Are you hankering for the good old days of internet dial up. Then look no further than three for all your mobile needs. This companies network is a joke.!!! Do yourselves a favour and do not sign up with this company for your contract. I've had a year of misery and another year to go. I'm a truck driver and travel all over the country and it's in so many places this network is poor. During phone calls the other person cant not hear you or you can't hear them. Calls cut off all the time. Texts often delayed. And the mobile internet is an absolute joke. Your phone will tell you it's 4 g + or 5 g and yet you can't even view pictures in the likes of Facebook or they take so long to load that it's just totally frustrating. It's not my phone because I've tried two. It's not my SIM because I've had a replacement. There is something inherently wrong with this company's network so avoid avoid avoid at all costs and save yourself a load of frustration. I've Tried them all and Vodafone is the best. Should have stuck with them.

Here is the best part, They cancelled all my services behind my back and said nothing more we can do, you can phone sales tomorrow and take out a new contract.
Wow and they own EE what can I expect after being a loyal customer for in excess of 15 years, when my contract runs out.

After several calls I was told they were on strike so would not be coming. Even though the day before they had assured me they would!. At 3pm they sent another message saying an engineer would be with us shortly to carry out the work. Of course no one turned up.

171084,"If you want:
Bad signal in 90% of places you visit (missed countless business and personal calls)
Constant increased costs
The worst customer service
False promises to fix issues

Then go with 3!

How is it legal to be stuck in a contract for so long when the company doesn’t keep up their part of the bargain?

A contract should work both ways - they SHOULD provide a good service (at the least) and I pay each month. But instead you get RUBBISH service and still had to pay every month for almost 2 years. Can’t wait to leave!! Never again!

There needs to be more protection for consumers against companies like this to leave free of charge at any time. I feel like 3 falsely advertised their connection and service and I’ve been stuck with them for 2 years. (No chance of paying the get out fee)
I see 3 are replying to peoples reviews. If you see this then don’t waste your time, I’m not interested."

134421,"Absolutely disgusting service, appalling customer service and inexistent continuity in client care. I am making this publication hoping that I will prevent other people experiencing the pain and time waste I have been put through. Even though it’s almost traumatic for me to go through this timeline of events:
My partner first signed up for Virgin Fibre Broadband services in October 2022. We were told we had to wait about a month until the installation could be done – during that month we contacted Virgin twice to make sure that the cable/ pre-installation work had been done as we knew the area surrounding the house was owned by a property management company and suspected a permit must be needed. Each time we were reassured the external work had been done and there was no expected delay for the engineer visit and installation of services on the 2/11/22. On that day, the engineer said he could not install the services as the external work hadn’t been done. This was then the beginning of countless hours on the phone to try to understand what the problem was.
We then got an email out of the blue saying “I am sorry to hear you have cancelled our services”. We called Virgin to see why we received that and they said they could not explain it (shocker) – in their records we had cancelled it (but couldn’t say how and there were no records of it (!!). We then had to sign up all over again, with the sales team questioning the prices and not honouring the original offer. We asked them to go back on the record and listen to the original phone call but they seemed unable to do this – again not being able to offer any continuity.
After that, I stayed on hold for hours and transferred to the wrong people more times than I can count. I would try to have any sort of continuity by remembering the people’s names to then be told I was speaking to a different call centre altogether or the previous person had made no notes. I was reassured by Virgin that the visit would be done “that day” so many tinmes – I waited days at home, not leaving, afraid I would miss the visit. Again, so much time wasted. The next day the pain of being on the phone again without getting any answers.
The lack of communication between the subcontractors who do the external work and Virgin is ridiculous – I kept being told they had no way of speaking to them! I assumed the delay was due to a permit problem (even though on the phone I was reassured countless times it wasn’t) so I contacted the property management company myself, asked them to sign a Wayleave and sent it to Virgin.
Finally, I am contacted by Kelly who explained that the pre-installation team had been going to the wrong address all this time! Hence the cable work not been done yet. Even though we now knew the problem, they still could not tell me when the cable work would be done. I had to chase it again multiple times when then I am told they now needed a permit from the council. Days go by again and eventually they tell me the permit was for the 19/11/22 and then the engineer visit would be done on the 26/11/22. You have guessed right: not the external work nor the engineer visit happened AGAIN! Virgin sent us a dongle after we spent hours and hours on the phone but that did not even work properly as our house has very poor signal (hence we needing the fibre installed).
This has caused an immense inconvenience in our personal and work lives. It's now 6/12/22 and when I called Virgin today I got the usual “we have a note on our system saying the work will be done today” – a sentence I have heard over 10 times in the past month! We STILL DO NOT HAVE INTERNET (it’s been over a month). This is an absolute joke.
To make it all even better, when we claimed the compensation we are entitled to according to the website “£5.25 per day if we don’t install your services on the promised day until installation is complete” they have also said no and given us a £26.24 cheque instead. Seems fair, right?
Please learn from this experience, and use a company with minimum dedication to costumer service instead."
127485,"I'm having a bad experience with talk talk for about 9 day's.
They left me without internet for 8 day's and now my land line not working.
I don't know what to do anymore, after being on the phone for more than 1.30 minutes without nothing done."
124611,"DREADFUL. We have a fault on our broadband. Both the customer service and the ability to fix it appalling. We have had seven appointments booked for a BT engineer to attend. Out of those seven, two did not bother turning up. The other five have failed to fix the issue. A complaint has been raised, but still no resolution. BT unhelpful to the extreme. It also does not help when you are stuck in a never ending telephone system without being able to speak to an actual person."

On unpacking the unit we found a dint in the front s/s panel and also a substantial impact dent on the side panel...
Naturally, we were disappointed and contacted Hughes Customer Service team.

We received prompt, professional, customer support -and they dealt with the issue to our satisfaction.

I judge a company by how it performs when things go wrong. I have no hesitation in rating Hughes 5 star for service and value."
141598,"Still no broadband after a house move 9 days ago. Have been told fixed 3 times and it wasn’t.
BT support team are very confrontational. I talked to Craig, nice chap but just blamed Openreach and made sarcastic comments about their own support team. Following day I talked with Macaulay and all he wanted to do was tell its £400 to cancel the contract and that BT can go up to 30 days of providing no service and that is acceptable. The mini hub they sent is slower than an Adsl modem from the year 1999.

I returned it to my local store who where very apologetic and swopped it for a similar item, I did have to put extra money towards the replacement item which I was a bit dismayed at but the customer service was fantastic."

102537,If I could put less than 1 star I would. They are just a money grabbing company. We have been with them from the beginning. They were Motorola before. My husband was in business and gave them his. We have stayed loyal but we NEVER got anything back. Our bills where in excess of £150 per month for 3 phones. I've transferred to BT and the bill is around £20 a month for 2 phones. Unfortunately the third is still under contract. Would NEVER recommend Vodafone. Absolute trash.

182849,"Helpful, engaged and attentive staff made the purchase of my new piece of HiFi easy and reassuring.

Unfortunately the sales experience continues until the equipment is actually delivered and the last star was lost due to the delivery experience.

An automated ’Oh No!’ each day the DPD delivery didn’t happen, and no means of finding out if/when it would ever be delivered, soured the excitement of the purchase such that I was on the verge of cancelling the order. After 3 days of unrewarded waiting in for the ‘after 11:00 delivery text’ the parcel was delivered at 08:00 with 15 minutes notice.

The equipment was worth persevering with but I’ve learnt my lesson and will not buy anything again unless it is in stock.

Richer Sounds approach and staff deserve better than the delivery service it employs.

Oh, and please replace the ‘Oh No!’ on your email noting the delay. It comes over incredibly insincere if you can’t give any reason except ‘unforeseen’ and delivery will be the following day* (*unless it’s not)"

Do you want me to resend it back to them for a refund knowing I won’t have a phone for another two week we put a three day wait for bank transfer during a royal Mail strike I have ordered many things from them before and items where is the damaged, not working, faulty or broken I’m a disabled and have got walking difficulties and keep making me go back and forwards to the post office with every single order"
183461,Samir was extremely helpful and efficient
193327,Absolutly awful company no phone recieved and still no refund i would never ever shop there again and this shop shouldnt even be allowed to run cause it is just automatic computer emails as responses to you and they have no remorse for anything and dont acutally send you a product
177376,"Sent my phone off marked it as in excellent condition as it has only ever been in a 360 degree case. Was told price had to be reduced due to multiple scratches (even though it says wear and tear marks acceptable) photos received so asked for phone back as the marks were not on it when it was sent, they tried to offer me a little more money but I refused. Phone received back and the ‘scratches’ were dirty marks that weren’t on the phone when it was sent. Phone wiped clean and sold for asking price elsewhere."
114196,Excellent quality and pricing as always. The only minor issue was a delay in delivery but that was down to the Royal Mail.
198560,"Also long standing customer and disastrous service when I wanted to upgrade. In store staff seem poorly trained with no motivation, rotten culture never ring you back when they say they will. Even worse in the call centre I have spent hours and achieved nothing including last night over 2 hours 5 different consultants. I just want to terminate my Vodafone account."
173538,"If I could rate them 0 stars, I would.

As a loyal customer for decades (and 11 years at this address), stupidly now paying £115 pm for broadband and TV, I called last week to ask to take advantage of the new BT Home Essentials service for those on low incomes. This would give me broadband and very basic TV for £27 per month.

All of the telecoms companies have committed to providing social tariff rates for people like me who are in receipt of means tested benefits. BT's version of this is *supposed* to be BT Home Essentials, but they won't tell you about this product, even if you ask. They are more likely to sell you a more EXPENSIVE broadband package than you're already on, which was what happened to me on my first call to them last week to discuss how I could access cheaper broadband. Even if you tell BT EXACTLY what you want, ie ""I want BT Home Essentials"", they will say they'll put you on that plan but that too will be a lie. Because they won't do what they say, they'll just fob you off with promises and platitudes. When you call again the following week, to chase up your new service, they will tell you that you are not actually in receipt of Income Support (one of their eligibility criteria) even though you are...even though it is your husband's name that receives it through the National Insurance number, and YOU, as his wife, are deemed to be on Income Support for ALL other legal purposes including claiming Housing Benefit or free school meals for your son!!!...they will bizarrely suggest that YOU should instruct the DWP to change THEIR systems...it would be funny if it wasn't so distressing.

I'm disabled with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, in a wheelchair and I need cheap broadband. I suffer with depression, and extreme anxiety for which I have ongoing counselling. These phone calls to BT have tested my mental resilience to its extreme. I have cried at times which is so embarrassing to admit. My husband is my carer, hence Income Support for Carers (a very specific type of benefit that blows up BTs algorithm) and my husband was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer last February. If we, on our low income and in our vulnerable position, don't qualify for the social tariff then who does???

The attitude of blunt advisers who transferred me through to dead ends, or to others who couldn't help, was particularly challenging as I LOVE repeating myself over...and over...and over...knowing they're never listening to me and that they do not give a damn and that nothing will change because BT simply don't care about providing even a basic level of decent customer service. Special mention must go to Joseph, in the ""loyalty team"", who offered broadband and basic TV at 39.99 per month. But when I asked if I could take some time to think about it, as I don't want a full 24month contract because - to be blunt - I don't know if my husband will die in the next 24 months, Joseph warned me that I would need to decide there and then. He said, ""I can't promise that this offer will be available beyond today"". Talk about duress and bad sales practice.

I have had enough of them. I feel discriminated against as a vulnerable disabled customer about whom they don't just not care. They pay lip service (in meaningless policy statements) to their supposedly accessible services!

I have now raised this matter with OFCOM. I will raise it with relevant Members of Parliament and the media (where necessary) in order to raise awareness of how inaccessible & misrepresented BT's supposedly beneficial social tariff truly is. As a former lawyer myself, if I had ever treated any of my clients in such an obstructive and disdainful manner, I would have rightly expected to go out of business.

It's a shame that BT are too big to fail; they certainly don't deserve to succeed. If you have the opportunity to choose your broadband/TV provider, go ANYWHERE other than BT."
188747,"Agree with other reviews. Bad to the extent of feeling deliberately fraudulent. Once you have an account..try finding out via their on-line portal when your contract ends. Customer service is a brick wall. The helpline is hopeless, customer service via email is not an option. The only useable option is on-line chat.
Having terminated a contract recently we have had daily phone calls from Three.
There are too many other options available to make Three worth your business"
151965,Ordered hob on Friday and arrived Monday. Great service yet again by Appliances Direct.

172288,"Ordering was easy online and my dishwasher arrived 6 days later. I paid extra for my old one to be disconnected, new one installed and old one taken away. Unfortunately my connection wasn't straight forward so they couldn't do this. Had I known I'd have got my connection changed before ordering. We were given a refund for this straight straight away though."

Overall i have found Richer sounds a pleasure to deal with, both on-line and in person at their branches."
130380,"I needed a new drawer for our freezer and came across the BuySpares website, I found the correct item after a little bit of time spent hunting through the website however, that was probably down to me not locating the serial number quicker. Ordered and forgot to check the next day delivery however, it was delivered within two days so, I have to say that I received excellent service and therefore I would recommend BuySpares and no doubt I will need to use them again."
163497,"Took up a £1 membership for two months, but somewhere in the print, extra stuff gets automatically added on after one month. I didn't spot that. Ended up paying an extra fiver for Dolby Stereo! Had an online chat with customer service. Took them ten minutes to find the print where that was mentioned! Customer service guy in India paid a pittance and dealing with multiple customers a time. Rubbish, lengthy online customer service experience. Sky have outsourced to maximise profit and exploit workers. Multiple screens to cancel membership. I think I watched one film in nearly three months. I'll steer clear next time, no matter how cheap it is. I recommend you do the same."
175737,"These books are a sensation to the old days of developing photos and putting them in an album and are now the new modern photo album of the 2020's.

With the selection of pages for photo's available on a page these books allow you to use so many more photos that would otherwise sit on a memory stick somewhere.

We now have quite a collection of books showing our experiences and memories gone by."
143727,I would give them 0 for their service. I have cancelled the contract in august and still sending the bills which was shocking. They are really robbing people. i will not recommend anybody for thriving this network
122146,"BT have become a joke of a business, they can’t even understand why a customer may be annoyed that all of a sudden my bill is now £90 per month, this is up from £45 a couple of years ago with no explanation at all. They try and baffle you with jargon and then want £280 for me to end a contract that I have never agreed to based on that price. They even threatened me with court action if I did not pay the £280 despite failing to meet their most basic legal requirements. Take my advice and go elsewhere far better products and service with competitors and much lower prices"
133450,"1 star is too many

AWFUL, LYING SCUMBAGS

Save yourself the stress and hassle and go elsewhere. They lie outright about delivery days times. I have been waiting for weeks. Having promised it would be delivered today they now inform me it will be tomorrow, I have zero confidence in them or their ability to deliver a product."

143473,Nobody gave more than the very lest possible guidance and you had the feeling they were bored. The tracking tool was useless and full of errors. The windows levels has come back at the level of the PC when purchased at (Vista) not 8.1 which it was running now. I talked to the engineer and he took the key for 8 which has a free upgrade 8.1 and got the impression it would return at 8.1 When and if it gets back to me I have a lot of work to do to bring it up the level the it was sent. A one star rating is only because they don't allow a minus. I will never use Curry's again. I was going to buy new TV but nobody in the store could answer basic questions. Bored again or not motivated.
119946,"Maybe I was lucky finding a supplier that stocked ALL the bits and pieces I needed to repair my Pressure Washer, but ESpares had the lot, sent it all in a well-packed box, and I received it a couple of days later. Very pleased indeed. It all fitted perfectly, and the machine is back to top performance. But had to be careful on the website to select EXACTLY the right replacement parts - a lot of very similar....."

I now need to find another present or order a replacement from you if I want same model which I did. But now too late to get in time for Xmas. Very disappointed."

173268,"I've been trying to cancel my service and, as I'm moving to Virgin, I need to contact them to do so.

I cannot find a phone number and the online chat is not being staffed by people at the moment.

The website sends you round in circles and an e-mail address that I have used before returns a message telling me that it is no longer monitored.

I am still waiting for a member of staff to phone me from a complaint that I lodged last week requesting that they ring me ASAP.

The chat bot that is currently ""staffing"" their online chat has an IQ worthy of a government minister and, like a government minister, will not answer the question that is posed to him!

Customer service zero!!!!

140797,"I ordered a Medion Erazer E10 Gaming laptop last Wednesday 5th. Laptop arrived next day, very fast. However, after I followed the instructions to set up the laptop it quickly transpired it was faulty. The battery was discharged and sat at 0% for hours. It said charging but it wasn't. If I unplugged it, it completely died. I requested a refund and the customer service member said that I should order a new one next day as this would be quicker than waiting for a replacement. I ordered a new one, but unfortunately on Friday, Yodel had a 'trailer fire' which delayed my delivery. I called Monday only to be informed my second order had been damaged in the fire! I spoke to another team member who ordered yet ANOTHER laptop for me. This didn't come next day Tuesday as they said, but Wednesday (today). I set everything up as per the instructions again only to my disbelief ... after a week of waiting, this third laptop has the exact same battery defect as the first. It has been completely discharged and will not charge above 0%. I am thinking perhaps it is a faulty batch or something, but it's absolutely appalling. I now have ordered and paid for 2 laptops which are faulty. The customer service team are perfectly friendly and helpful and were quick to answer my calls, however unfortunately this experience has really put me off which is so disappointing. One faulty laptop is bad luck but 2 is ridiculous."

183404,"I was looking to build a PC, but with the not-so-recent graphics card supply issues, it's made it harder to do so. So, rather than waiting for another however many years, I looked into pre-built/custom-built configs. I will admit, I did look at more companies other than just PC Specialist, comparing costs and delivery time - as well as base cost if I were to buy all the parts myself.

In the end, PC Specialist seemed like the best choice. I looked at a few reviews and they were pretty positive. I think it's important to do your due diligence before spending a decent chunk of money and they were very transparent with where to find their reviews. Always a good sign.

I will admit, I purchased a few days before December so was a bit unsure if I would receive before Christmas. What with work dying down, it would've been nice to have a good rig for gaming in my increased downtime. I even contacted their support and they were able to tell me exactly when my PC was scheduled to be built which reassured me.

Come to the delivery, DPD were great. Knew when to expect it, and the delivery guys were very kind as to leave it where I requested.

The setup of the PC itself was incredibly simple. Just had to remove a protective foam within the PC and plug everything in. It all worked first time. I did have a few beeps and, upon my own research, just had to reseat the memory and GFX card - both of which I was able to do myself. I may have knocked them while removing the foam so just something to be aware of.

The PC has been running fine since, with ""fine"" being an understatement. It's great and I love it. Definitely made a few friends jealous!

Another thing to quickly note is that your order arrives with a box containing the relevant manuals (and stickers!) for certain parts (like the motherboard). Pretty useful. Also a little handbook from PC Specialist themselves which was appreciated.

All-in-all, I would recommend buying from PC Specialist. May even do so myself in the future."

124824,"I have a business landline with BT which has now been out of operation for a week. Reported 11/10 and was advised engineers will be expected to fix fault (outside fault) by 13/10. Received email from BT lunchtime 13/10 to say fault cancelled??? Spent rest of the afternoon trying to get fault reinstated and to find out WHY it had been cancelled - which they were unable to justify. . Eventually I was advised that it would then be fixed on the 17/10. This was not done and this morning I received an email requesting I contacted their call centre as they wanted to speak to me about the fault - spent a further 40 minutes on their call centre web chat site only to be told this was a mistake and they did not want to speak me and to just ignore the email and their engineers would fix it on the 19/10. In addition to the foregoing and despite the fact they assured me they would divert all calls to my mobile this has either not been done or their divert system is just not working. I have during the above period spoken to their call centre seven times (usually between 30/45 minutes each time) to try and get both the divert and the landline fault sorted out and have now just about given up trying. Effectively I have now been cut off for the best part of a week on a business landline. It is totally impossible to get through to the UK help line number and I have already sent a letter of complaint both to their head office and filled in a complaint form online. Interestingly their web site states: 2 Open faults 18/10 13/10 - there is only one fault! and their Fault History states: 11/10 resolved, 13/10 resolved. TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE"

The person on duty spent over 40 minutes on the phone describing the pros and cons of both, and answering endless questions from me patiently. He was knowledgeable, expert with an competent knowledge of both. There was no hard sell, he was patient and only eager to help. He was also happy to talk me out of products I might not need (at my level).

They asked me to post it back, tracked, first class on 18.09.20. They have had it since 21.09.20. Despite countless emails and prevarication, I have still not had a replacement nor the original one repaired and returned. Over the past seven weeks, they have given me assurances that it is ""a priority"" ""top of the list for dispatch"" etc. None of this is true. Deadlines come and go. They are incompetent and mendacious. I don't believe they should be trading. The Court will make their ruling and I hope no-one will be tempted to purchase anything from in the future."
132416,"The Engineer called on the morning to confirm a time slot, he arrived on time and had the spare parts to quickly fix the fault.
A very satisfied customer"
175804,Delivery within 24 hrs. Brilliant!
174662,"Having just purchased another product from Gtech, I am once again very happy.The customer service is excellent and also my order was delivered the following day."

163316,"Tried to get NowTV Broadband for over two months. They kept cancelling at the last minute, disconnected my neighbours phone for a month, were unable to call back when they said they would and were simply incompetent. Their one job was to connect my phone line and they could not do it. Avoid this company at all costs."
171249,I ordered a new razor o line the Website stated available to collect in my local store and the item was in stock ... after paying for the item and going down to collect it I received a email stating that I couldn't collect it for three days dispite it being in stock .. this should be stated before you pay not once you are at the store ...the customer service was awful the store manager seemed very uninterested and told I'd have to take itup with the website in the end I had to call for a full refund as I didn't want to take time off work to collect the item will not be buying from curry's in the future!
116979,It's the first time I've shopped with you guys in years. This totally due to my life and not the store. While the guy who served us was spot on he did I felt lacked a full understanding of the the kit I was looking at. H was good but just stumbled at a couple of questions. I would have really preferred he had asked one of the other members of staff or looked it up. As I say my experience was really good it could have been great.
161920,Excellent seller great for hard to find parts
196912,"Wouldn’t bother ordering if you’re vulnerable, they could not care less.
Ordered a washing machine to be delivered today. Got a phone call cancelling when I was the next drop as they could not go over their driving limit (not the drivers fault) the driver said it would be delivered on the 7th. Spoke to live chat and they said the 11th explained it is for a blind family member and I need to be at home and it’s needs to be delivered earlier than the 11th. They stated they would escalate it and it may be delivered within 24-48. I explained I need a definite day to get it off work. They could not provide me with that. I asked to raise a complaint and get compensation and they ignored it and said it’s been recorded. So I’m still left completely clueless. Will it turn up on the 7th or the 11th who knows?"
118266,"2 wood chisels arrived without edge protectors. Both were damaged. Reported in delivery with photos attached to email as proof. 3 days later i had to chase email and it hadnt even been openend.
Replaced within 24hrs.
They need to up their game for trades. This is DIY facility.

Recieved an apology and a long winded version of my review.
Not sure what this was to achieve other than to make FFX feel better.
Nothing has changed. If you state in writing that 'rerurns' emails will be dealt with in 24hrs or slightly longer, i dont expect that to be 3 days or considerably longer if i hadnt chased it up and spent 20mins on hold in doing so."
112852,"Phoned ,told lovely patient lady what was wrong.She knew exactly what I needed.,and how much it would cost.
Received new part one day later.My hand held machine worked right away."
162247,Very happy with TalkTalk and especially with their staff member Mr Muhammad Aoun. Very professional and very caring for customer needs. Also makes you feel at ease and not pressured. Keep up the good hard work.
159185,"Very.Co.uk returns and arrears depts don’t talk to each other. They lost my return and account put on hold but arrears dept kept sending arrears notices who affected my credit score. Customer Services and Finance/Credit delta are a bloody joke. I’ll never ever buy from them again or Littlewoods as was going to buy an upgrade to the item returned but they can forget that now.
Sent the requested details yesterday but, guess what, no update from Very despite saying they'd love to help - yeh, right, just makes the problem bigger. There's enough notes in the account records for them to get hold of this quickly and stop sending arrears whilst their returns team investigate how Yodel lost the item. At least that stops Very screwing up my 'very good' credit score, as my score has gone down already for the arrears and missing the first payment (I'm NOT paying for something I returned first week in January, Very's problem why they lost it, NOT mine) but the arrears payment is due again next week and don't want this to impact my credit score further - useless interworking between Very's Finance, Customer Services and Returns teams. As I said before will NEVER buy from them/Shop Directr etc. ever again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
109077,On hold for over 50 mins very bad if need help
120604,"Immediate next day delivery on ordering
Good customer service"
158581,Phone took a couple extra days which was expected. Product In perfect quality. Would recommend.
173354,I always had difficulty with Virgin broadband and as an existing customer with 02 which has really poor signal/connection In the Sale area I thought that this would be the answer to my signal flaws as Im now with the BEST TO PROVIDERS………… Alas it’s not the case !!!!!!!!!! Poor signal and poor broadband even with a Wi-Fi booster ☺️ TIME TO CHANGE unless u sort your promises!!!!!!!!
105081,Delivered 20 days late and damaged. Impossible to contact a human being to query. Given up. Avoid as cheap but not worth it.
112110,"I wanted to know why I had not received an invoice for goods purchased.
My query was answered promptly and politely.
Thank you."

197675,"I love the PC I ordered! It's expertly put together and ready to use, and even received a helpful email with additional information, which I didn't expect and turned out to be incredibly useful.

Honestly, big thanks for this beautiful hunk of electronics that powers my games! :D"
122378,"Unfortunately the engineer left after fixing a fault with the washer/dryer, and on first use after he had gone another fault occurred so now we need to wait a week for another engineer to come back and try to fix the machine."
110310,"No messing, paid exactly what i was quoted the same day they received the phone. Definitely use them again"
107363,"Everything arrived, complete and on time. Very pleased. Thank you."
156126,"Great to be able to have items delivered to home. Started ordering for Christmas in September/October so I could spread the cost. Nice items, plenty of choice. Delivered quickly and without any hassle. Not cheapest but certainly not dearest either"
128369,Prompt delivery. Wide choice and Availability.
110019,"This mobile company does not have a customer care service that a user can access, its charges are outrageous and Data leaks out even when not used. it quickly runs out and ever-hungry for top ups. There is no warning at any stage of usage so that the user can appropriately set his use and not be stranded. Such a company wouldn't last a day in my country India before the regulators are at its door. what a ripoff."
188052,"I have always been happy with the service I have received from TalkTalk. On the last occasion I lost my broadband connection at night. The troubleshooting online process did not solve the problem and I had to wait until next morning to phone for help. I phoned as soon as TalkTalk opened and got through to Jason the technician within a few minutes. Jason was polite and professional, he understood my problem and was thorough in sorting it out for me. He explained things to me as we were waiting for the checks to complete. He ascertained there was a fault that required an engineer to resolve and may require the engineer to enter my house to change the router. I was given an appointment for the next day and received an SMS confirmation. The next day I received an SMS that the engineers name was Hillary with the window times of arrival. The engineer arrived, showed me his pass for security and after a few checks confirmed that it must be the router. He changed the router and all was well. Thank you TalkTalk and well done."
142557,"Speedy delivery, exactly the part I needed. Well packaged so it wouldn’t break. Highly recommend"

And do not waste my time for nothing"
135464,"Over the moon with my purchase from Mr Memory.
I wanted to see if my aging laptop could handle more RAM, and Mr Memory advised this was possible.
I ordered the same day, and the RAM was delivered within a week.

Great service, highly recommended."
199222,The phone doesn’t work whatsoever. It doesn’t charge and NEVER turns on. Worst £85 I’ve ever spent and so dissatisfied.
104584,I had my phone stolen from me on the Sunday. I called to start my claim on the Monday. They explained that my claim has been accepted and advised me to go to Carphone Warehouse to place my order for my replacement phone. I did this before 5pm on the Monday and had my phone delivered to me on the Tuesday. This is by far the best and most reliable insurance company. I would definitely recommend to family and friends.
176284,"I sent my iPhone 11 in and I’d checked it prior to sending. There were no scratches anywhere and it was in excellent condition. Once received, Mazuma advised that I had more than 3 minor scratches on the screen so my offer was lowered. I was confused as I’d checked it, it had been kept in a case and had a screen protector on. I presumed I’d missed something and accepted the offer, but reading the poor reviews I now think I was conned.
I’ve uses Mazuma numerous times and trusted them to be fair, but won’t use again. I’ve given 2 stars for fast payment."
195535,Part was ordered and came on time in good condition. Quite easy to fit with the help of a YouTube video.
116834,"Shambles, they provide poor speeds, awful customer service, can’t keep to the dates they agreed for set ups and I suggest you only go with them if there is no other choice for the area. Joke company"

4 stars because it was priced higher than other outlets who could not provide it."

147467,"I paid for the delivery man to install the washing machine, but he said it was too fiddley. he bumped the water pipe under the sink and left with the washing machine in the middle of the kitchen uninstalled and a leak... which I had to get repaired.

My mum lived at the property before me and an AO guy installed her washing machine fine.

Not happy"
169479,They are utterly useless. If you value your time and want to be treated respectfully please choose a different company.
196380,"Very happy with this prompt service
Exactly what I wanted"

144603,"Beware, this ghd website is fake, they will take your money, then leave you without an item, and no contact. It's shocking how this company treats People. As I used my credit card on this awful fake ghd website they have forced me to raise a dispute to hopefully get my money back. Avoid this so called ghd website, it is not genuine and it is fake. If you do use them, then you will regret it, when they take your money and run."
196349,"simplicity of purchase, plus location of items, really friendly helpful staff (Aneela, castle marina store)"

185463,Hi! I’m Kya and I have had a great experience within Brandbassador. The app functionality is overall very user friendly and has helped me grow my overall social presence and made a positive impact upon me!!
121699,Pretty much the same experience everyone else has had... you think you've cancelled your subscription but there will be ways they still charge you for more. Almost impossible to complain as you are sent in circles trying to find somewhere or someone to complain. Just be prepared to pay for a month or two after you cancel... you have other subscriptions you unknowingly!!
146934,"The time table has been not respected, delivered 3 hours later without any information. Also my appliance has been delivered to other person. Luckily there is another same model which the courrier manage to give it to me by removing the label number and went to get back the previous one.Things happen."
181339,"Very pleased with computer. PC Specialist kept me up to date by sending regular emails on the status of the build, even when order was running late. I would recommend them."

Very polite, helpful and respected my property."
188266,"Having paid for delivery for something I expect it to be delivered quicker than it was, and it was that small it could have delivered by normal post and that would have been quicker than your delivery service.
Also having used your website to order my item I have had scam e-mails for telling I need to pay more for delivery, which I can’t get rid of.
Thank you for replying to my review,but the fact I had paid for delivery which is between 5 and 10days but which takes longer than normal post which is cheaper, and the fact I am now plagued with scam e-mails after ordering on your web site."

111015,"So far so good, just waiting for my cash out"
162574,"Signed up to their broadband deal as best value in the market and swapped to their router on the first day of the contract. I got a couple of texts telling me the order was delayed which I thought were scams as the only previous method of communication were emails.
Then my old provider charged me twice my normal fee! Turns out I was still with them (the NowTV router works with my old provider) and they had charged me the out of contract fee!
NowTV had failed to fulfil the order but not clearly communicated that. They eventually cancelled the order as my connection wasn't right apparently and because they cancelled the order I'm not due any compensation! Going through complaints process but they take 2 weeks to reply after me chasing rather than the 72 hours they state."
115543,Blu-ray box-set was well packaged & delivered promptly.
114574,Bit slow to arrive even though I selected priority delivery but got the memory I needed and works great as always

124155,Delivery driver was an absolute joke and had no idea of how to use GPS. He stated that he couldn’t be bothered to find our house and left it randomly. Absolute jokers.
145997,"The replacement part was ordered on 20th September, 2021 with a delivery of 5-7 days, the package was despatched 21st September 2021 on a 48 hour tracked basis but did not arrive, your company did an excellent job in packing and despatching the spare part but you were let down by Royal Mail who did not deliver within the time frame you must be disappointed that a third party could impact on your rating.

The package has now arrived and it works."
111718,"Another great experience with PC Specialist, I doubt I would buy a PC elsewhere, the service is outstanding and I'm very impressed with aftercare.

Only dropped a star because I used the ""amend order"" link immediately after ordering and nothing happened. The order came, then the replacement.
All good in the end. Thanks"
155654,"If I worked as fast as my internet speed, I would be out of a job and replaced quicker than me typing this message and I am a very quick typer..

If BT was life support, they wouldnt have any customers left..

If having snail pace internet speeds and connection issues was a good thing, BT would be the best internet service provider in the UK!

Not even my 1gigabyte wifi enchancer that cost me £180 can fix your internet.. It sucks so bad, even if it was free and given to a cave man, they would want a refund.."
125216,"I use FFX as they keenly priced and deliver a quality product in a timely fashion.
Unfortunately the last item I ordered was damaged on arrival.
Fortunately the FFX team arranged a prompt pickup and refund for the defective item.

119349,"My spouse and I--both with non-British accents--attempted to make a purchase at Norwich Vodafone at Chapelfied Mall. They would NOT accept my Visa credit card, which is chip-and-signature. That is NOT RIGHT. We were told ""that's not how we do things here."" We left embarrassed and humiliated. Vodafone seems notoriously difficult to contact for support on this matter, and when you go to chat, you get platitudes. Is this right? Look up the article in The Guardian ""How shops sign away the self-worth of disabled people."""
115091,"Reliable in every aspect, precise on timing, easy to understand"
187099,I have used Ebuyer in the past and have always been pleased with the service. I have not built my PC yet so can not comment on the parts I purchased.
152086,In my opinion appalling and patronising customer service. Can’t speak to anyone on the phone. They don’t listen to actual problem and just give same response. Other great feature of chat is they take so long to respond it will time out and you have to start all over again!
132061,"Ordered a ""photo on canvas"" as well as a fridge magnet as an extra. Great product and arrived on schedule despite being shortly before CHristmas.
Only gripe, the magnet would appear to be made elsewhere and so had to pay additional postage which made it quite an expensive add on. I could have cancelled but of course, once at the checkout you feel a bit mean doing that!"
108976,"Very disappointed, bought broadband on the 19th of September and had a scheduled instal date of 4th October. It then got changed to the 17th of October. Got no phone call to say they was coming. I then phoned them to ask what was happening for them to say it was cancelled. No idea who cancelled it but it wasn’t us. Was changed to the 31st , now the 7th of November. What a joke."
104753,"They don't honour their deals and you have to be on hold for an hour if you want to speak to someone.

Ordered a new phone on the Black Friday deal, received email requesting additional information 2 days later which I replied to immediately. Waited for my phone to come and continued to login and check my order which stated processing. I tried calling to see what was happening and every time the wait time was nearly and hour. exactly 2 weeks later I received an email stating my order has been cancelled. I called them back after waiting an hour on hold only to be told that the order has been cancelled and the offer is no longer available.

I was assured a manager from their customer service team would call within 24hours. A week later and no call.

I don't understand how their trustpilot score is so good. As soon as you read the reviews it's obvious that this company do things like this all the time.

158155,"Was rung by a telephone sales women a day after I did an inquiry about an upgrade as my contract was near 24 months. She was very keen to get a deal with me as the deal got better and better but oh I wish I'd put the phone down as I hadn't done my homework first. To clinch the deal she told me the was a 120 pound cashback deal with Huawei if I got the phone today 24th April as the deal runs out on the 26th April so I acceped the deal only to find out on Huawei website that the deal finished on 26th of march. I have tried to contact carphone warehouse on numerous times over my 14 day cooling off period, to be told on the phone not my department and the number on their website is closed due to corovirus. Also have not replied to any emails I've sent. So I'm now in a 24 month contract, after being sold a phone with lies and no aftersales service I will not be dealing with carphone warehouse again."
154973,"Great service, quick delivery, telly fantastic for the price. And on Klarna. Win win"
136040,"Ordered a phone online for next day delivery. It never arrived, after chasing up both cpwh and DPD via online chats, phone, and social media finally told me phone was lost in the warehouse and I now have to wait 3/4 days before I can do anything more. My issue isn’t that the phone has been lost it’s the poor customer service from this company for a communication network the communication is shocking!! Finally at the end of my tether went into store again nothing they can do cannot replace cannot cancel no apology from customer services or manager call Back as requested. Store were helpful but could do nothing. Avoid at all costs unless you don’t mind being lied too and ignored - cancellation will be required if suitable compensation isn’t offered!"

194975,"Had a problem with HomeHub2 where it would not stay connected to the devices in home. Tech support although difficult to get hold off were very helpful. Ended up going via sales team (also very helpful) as finding a telephone number that doesn't send you down an automation rabbit hole is very difficult.

Replacement HomeHub2 had exactly the same connectivity issues as the first one. Sent both HomeHub2's back to BT and bought an Asus router. Connectivity problems resolved themselves instantly and wi-fi is noticeably smoother and faster than the HomeHub2.

Turns out this is a problem BT know about and is documented in tech support forums but the guys on the phone seam unfamiliar. Hardware from BT is clearly not up to the job."

134456,"Ordered full fibre online, order confirmed along with an activation/installation date in 3 weeks time. During that time Vodafone decided they would cancel my order, for reasons that are still unknown - they're blaming Openreach. They did not email / text or call to let us know they'd cancelled the order - we became aware of the cancellation when the router never turned up and we chased them.
Anyway to cut a long story short this meant we didn't have internet in our new house for 42 days, we now have great Sky full fibre service. Their complaints process is just as infuriating and I'll never buy from them again, despite being a customer for several years in the past."

196409,"We have been with Virgin media for a bout 18 months - and have had non stop issues. We cant go with any other provider as they are not available in our area. We have poor performance issues for 2 weeks. Its Christmas and the kids have been unable to watch any movies at all. When calling them, no one can help and no one understands your situation. The engineers visit has been scheduled for a weeks day. On top of that there is no mention of compensation and they still sent me a bill for a whole month when i haven't been able to use the service for 2 weeks. This has been such a joke - DO NOT CHOSE VIRGIN."
172471,"Very fast service, processing and delivery. Item very well packaged and was in perfect condition
And as advertised. Absolutely no problems or dramas. What a refreshing change with online ordering. I definitely recommend Wex Photo Video."
132347,"It was easy to order through the app. When my order had not arrived a week after the date specified I used the contact us chat, and I was sent a replacement order immediately . Really good service."
139436,"If I could give 0 stars I would. DISGUSTING.
They falsely advertised Black Friday deals that were no longer available, added a “free next day delivery” and when the order had gone through & they took my money they send me a confirmation that my phone would arrive in 30 days.
I then called to clarify this issue, and waited over 2 hours on a premium number for them to pick up and explain the problem to me.

They didn’t even have the courtesy to refund me for the money I spent calling their customer service number -I honestly believe they do this on purpose just to make some income of their customer complaints."
182863,"just had the annual valet done to my 12 month old washing machine which started to emit a slight odour. the cleaner who arrived barely spoke any english and wouldnt even understand simple questions. as for the cleaning it was absolutely terrible and a waste of mone yand time, he simply used a dirty tissue roll to wipe down a water like spray whic hhe sprayed onto the clean washing machine. my 5 year old brother couldve put more effort and cleaned it better. defo do not recommend taking out a plan with them."
198084,Really quite shocked at how bad this has been…signal goes all the time; they agreed and booked appointment Monday and I drove 270 miles for it as having medical treatment in London… they cancelled saying it was fine. Spent 2 hours on chat getting new appointment for tomorrow. That was then cancelled. Went back to online service and asked for number to cancel and dreadful rude woman sent me a new 2 year contract and told me it would cost £300 extra with sky!!! Despite stating in writing I did not want a co tract she basically said she’d ordered it and I’d now have to cancel with cancellation team!!! Have emailed lawyer - I’m fairly sure this must be illegal …

Why are companies like this allowed to exist ??"
169725,"When my PC was delivered and I switched it on , I started to realise that their was something wrong , they had given me my Intel based PC with the AMD software set up onboard , everything from drivers to the BIOS , how it ever booted up I will never know but it did , worse than that how did they manage to get this so wrong before they delivered it to me ? , after all it was suppose to go through various checks and checked further by a different person , however if it wasn't for their ""Fantastic"" Technical Team who helped me by remotely taking over my PC to get things sorted and stayed on the phone talking me through the whole process on changing BIOS at their responsibility and reinstalling windows, I would have given PCS a 5 star rating but the person building my PC and the person who is suppose to check before its dispatched failed in all accounts and this is why I deducted 2 stars from this rating , but I cannot Fault Chris and Sam from the Technical Team for their fantastic help who spent a few hours on the phone and by remote fixed this issue , I believe most people would have sent this back for them to sort as I even thought about sending it back and asking for my money back , but I had used them before and I never encountered any problems , would it put me off using them again ... ? No as they have a excellent Technical Backup Team in place to help sort out the mess that their coworkers building the PC's fail to build / install properly . Hopefully PCS will endeavour to make sure this does not happen again to anyone elses build ..not a nice experience to go through if I am honest"
110236,Very quick and easy to use - only criticism is make sure you SAVE your changes - got to end hadn’t saved and had to do it all again BUT overall a very good experience. Would buy again
134345,"I find it hard to describe how bad Vodafone are. I have had 2 months of continual hassle with them and have spent, literally, hours on the phone, most of it on hold.
My broadband went down yet again tonight, I went on live chat, after 15 mins I passed security. At minute 25 they said they can't help, call back in the morning. This is the new super broadband with supposed booster and back up. I've logged onto my neighbours ""sky"" account (with their permission) to complete my online work. Equipment going back to VF tomorrow, I've had enough. They are absolutely woeful."

Tried re-booting but nothing worked so had to contact customer service.
""We have limited team at the moment so use our chat service"".
Chat service is down for maintenance.
After a couple of hours on the phone finally got to talk to a customer service agent who after going through all the usual checks said I would have to phone EERO customer service and gave me a number to phone much to the bemusement of the person I spoke who said it is nothing to do with them as they do not provide Internet services.
Phoned Talk Talk back again (luckily I had all day to spare to just deal with Talk Talk) and they agreed to send me a new EERO 6 the next day which I am now waiting in all day(nothing else to do)with no Wi-fi."

179822,"Horrorshow of a company. Purposely set up ridiculous amount of security questions so that you can't get through to cancel account. Literally holding customer to ransom, despite offering terrible service (33% of advertising internet speed)"
184781,"First of all, when I placed the order the first time, my order has been cancelled due to wrong postcode in system. Wich some employee typed it wrong in the system when I updated my address. Going back to cancelled order, no one bothered to call me to let me know or ask about my address.
I had to place the order for the second time. On 23rd of November I received email that my order will be shipped from 3 different branches. Two of them arrived in time. Last, no update about it. I have waited until 29th and I sent an email to support. I was told that sometimes Royal Mail doesn't update the system properly and my order should arrive soon. The person from support provided a tracking number for last parcel. I checked the tracking on RM website and my parcel was collected by RM on 28th. So, my guess is that no one bothered to ship my items ordered on 23rd until 28th around 5pm. This morning, 30th of November I have received an email from RM that they have my parcel and will be shipped soon.
I don't know who's to blame in this case. These reviews are for nothing anyway. CEX won't do anything about it.
By the way, in August I think, I have bought a laptop HP Omen, 2022 made, from CEX online. The touchpad was ""with problems"" sometimes was working sometimes not. I checked online and this was an issue from factory. Many people were complaining about it. I went to a branch, give them the laptop back. They checked the laptop noticed the problem and refunded me. But the laptop was on stock in that store on next day. I noticed this type of practice recently, iMAc with faulty usb port, graphic card with faulty HDMI port.
The pandemic made the businesses very hungry no matter the cost.
For today just 2 * CEX"

I got a phone, it didn't work. I got a replacement and it didn't work either. Then I was told I would have to send it off and I then decided to cancel the contract.

Phoned them to resolve this matter to be told their has been no notes made of me telling them I'm leaving aboustley rude.

136760,"Ordered a new washing machine from Currys when our old one died. I paid for early morning delivery, installation, and recycling of the old machine.

When the machine arrived, the delivery men complained about the stairs, asking if we'd informed Currys we were in a flat with stairs, which I had attempted to do, but Currys said it would be assessed on the day. The delivery people did deliver the machine, but made me feel like they were doing me a favour, rather than a paid for task. Amazingly, the Currys team who delivered the dishwasher just a week before were completely fine about the stairs and did a great job, so it was obviously down to this particular crew.

They proceeded to try to remove the old washing machine and after some faffing about, they said they were concerned that if they removed it, they'd damage the plumbing, so they said they'd only deliver the washing machine, and arranged for collection of the old one on the morning of 23/1 (today) and I would arrange my own installation.

I arranged for my own installation and the plumber said that someone had damaged the on/off tap in the pipe, It's my opinion that this was caused by the previous Currys installation team, as this tap worked perfectly when I turned the water off for their visit. This required a new tap be fitted, and the total cost of this was £80 including plumbing in the new machine.

Today, I waited in for the morning collection of my old machine and nobody arrived. I asked on Currys webchat what was happening and was told they'd come before 8pm and would call me an hour beforehand. At 7pm I'd had no call, so again contacted Currys on webchat, to be told the team were definitely coming so please wait for them. It's now gone 8pm and no show. So I've waited in 12 hours for this alleged morning collection of my old machine, which has been paid for, and Currys simply wasted my whole day.

EDITED to add: Currys did miss two appointments to collect and recycle the old machine, but the social team did arrange a third appointment for today, which a very polite team attended and took away the old machine with no fuss. It's not a great experience overall, but I am glad it was resolved with input from the social team."

This is the 3rd time they have done this to us - phones are always cased from day 1 and had screen protectors on from day 1. We also have photos taken prior to sending but they won't accept these saying they could have been taken at any time!!! Great scam if you can get away with it and right now they are....AVOID and sell your phone on facebook instead!

There is no way of knowing when i can collect my order, you cant phone the shop, i would have to travel 12 miles to ask a question.

Nine days after placing the order and paying a large deposit i have not any idea when i will collect, if after 10 days i have not had any contact from them i will cancel and the computer elsewhere.

Dont buy in the shop if its not in stock, no way of contacting currys store.

Instead we have had a long series of varied & inventive excuses, including COVID, staff shortages, quality inspection failures & more. Previous phones ordered from this site have also all failed to ship within the promised 7-10 days. We suspect that the company takes your money & then looks around the market to buy an appropriate phone. It's obvious that during COVID they have become completely unstuck. Avoid like a bad rash..."
151730,"1) it took 3 days and a huge amount of perseverance to set up a customer account because your system wasn't working.
2) your website is a pain to navigate, it says item available, I select the item and it tells me it's not available.
3) you rejected my 1st order but took the money, I had to wait for a refund.
4) your shop in Nottingham couldn't find the console advertise at their location and wanted to charge me extra.
5) you seem to have sent me the most scratched up and battered console you could find. All the way from Northern Ireland even though your website stated that 5 consoles were available within 30miles of me.
6) your store staff don't have a contact number for you so aren't capable of resolving issues.
I honestly don't know how you stay in business."

170355,"1) Do not trust if CPW website says it is in stock for next day delivery.
As an IT based company you'd expect them to manage stock but apparently not. 2) expect them to take the money up front, regardless of whether they can meet the commitment or not. I almost missed my daughter's birthday thanks to this bad selling practice. The website still showed stock available after completing the order . 6 days and no refund so far . I went to a good eBay seller and got next day delivery.
Terrible service from CPW."

173559,"I purchased a couple physical games recently. I am currently playing through them, no issues with that so far, but if you care for the boxes games come in, this is my experience.

The game boxes were grubby, and arrived with ugly stickers attached on the front cover. Removing them left a sticky adhesive which required some WD40 on a cloth to remove, so a good bit of cleaning was necessary. I believe cases should be kept in good condition, in addition to the games inside.

Furthermore, one of the games came with no manuals or additional content usually included in the box. I enjoy reading these and keeping them as collectibles, and nowhere on their website does it state that the game comes with or without these - it seems to be luck of the draw.

I think CeX should be grading physical games much like their devices. Good condition cases with minimal wear and manuals should be one such ""unboxed"" condition, and a ""discounted"" condition could embody games without some manuals and / or damaged cases."

136657,"I bought a Hotpoint washing machine & Knowhow warranty from Currys PC World in Friern Barnet.

After the 1st year we started having problems with it, the machine began chewing clothes and making a loud drilling noise.
It was repaired again and again, then parts were replaced but after a while it start doing the same thing.

In total it had been repaired 6 times so after getting completely fed up with it I contacted Knowhow and spoke to someone who told me I could request a replacement as it was lemon but I’d need to call another hotpoint engineer out to write it off.
She said have proof of the fault, I showed him the chewed clothes and videos my washing machine and the noise it was making.

So on the 7th call out the engineer came out and I showed him everything and he went saying he’d put a report in (he made no repairs).

Two weeks later I hadn’t heard anything from Knowhow so called in but they hadn’t had the report yet, 8 days later I spoke to someone named Chaz who also said I was entitled to a replacement/voucher after the 3rd-4th repair and would put in a request but I heard nothing again…

Yesterday after still not hearing back, I again called Knowhow only to be told that engineer reported he’d fixed the machine????
This is a lie as he never even touched the machine that day…..
I was put on hold for 13 minutes then with no more contact transferred to hotpoint at which point I put the phone down.

I’m absolutely fed up and disgusted by the customer service team + whats the point of buying the warranty if it doesn’t work as explained.

I won’t give up and need to complain."

Thank you for your eventual reply Kerry. All makes sense. Pity my email stating the same was ignored. My fault entirely.

120766,Reserved item online to collect from store. Picked up from store. Decided to return item. Went back to store who would not accept item as it was ‘ordered online’. Had to arrange collection from my house instead. Ridiculous system.

153067,"We ordered a Fridge-freezer on December 29 because it was on sale and at a good price. We also immediately paid the insurance of £53 for 4 years, because is worth it. Had to wait 10 days for delivery after purchase. But after 10 days passed, we began to wonder why no one is writing or calling us, even though we paid the full amount at once for everything? When we called, we found out that the order was cancelled because their supplier no longer has Fridges for sale at that price, even though they were on sale one day before. Now we still have to wait about 5 days to get a refund for everything. We've wasted 2 weeks and are still waiting for our money, and it's not a ridiculous amount, almost £800. Time waisters"

181249,"I paid for the faster internet so in theory should have been better than my previous provider but its actually not that good, the streaming is worse than it was before and occasionally stops working for no reason. i did try and cancel within the cooling off period but they made it so difficult that just ended up leaving it. If you ever need any help then contacting them is a nightmare. the live chat they respond once every 2 or 3 minutes which makes a conversation very slow. They said i had provided the wrong e mail address which i definitely hadn't because its the one that they e mail me on and when i said its deffinitely the right one they just ended the chat."
112646,"This is the first time I have purchased GHD’s and I have to say that they are by far the best straighteners I have ever had!
I did purchase the basic ones and I must say that they are just perfect for my needs. They are so powerful and so easy to use and they make straightening your hair effortless and give fab results.
The website, ordering process and delivery was great too. I opted to have my parcel delivered to a local collection point and that was extremely convenient for me.
I can’t see me purchasing anything else now after using GHD’s for the first time!"

It was general, including at the manufacturer's own website, so I don't blame Ebuyer for that, but I was disappointed they didn't tell me. I had to ring them. When I ordered a replacement it was too late for next day delivery, so it took 3 days rather than 1 day to get a new computer."
171636,Very good service. In future will regularly check the HMV website.
155949,"Awful.
Virgin offered me a new deal from my current one. They tried to reduce my broadband speed and have taken Sky Sports away.
My Virgin TV box does not work, I told them this, but apparently that’s ok and I’m not entitled to a new one. They made me take an O2 SIM card at £6 a month that I don’t need.
I was on the phone for 2 hours to get this terrible deal."
161269,"HI, the print quality is as good as hoped for and online ordering process for the pictures is easy to use.
The customer service thru live chat was a bit disjointed in terms of follow up.
Explaining a specific order was quite late possibly missing the initial replacement was ordered to be processed and dispatched ASAP at no extra cost...all positive.
Subsequent confirmation email advised only part of the order completed. Second live chat again positive and the full order confirmed for process and dispatch.
Part order now here, thank you! Still awaiting complete replacement order (appreciating Ind Action and Xmas causing issues out of your control).
Would simply offer this objective comment to smooth through the print , delivery and customer service process. Currently the original turned up some 5 days later than suggested ...have a second full print run and one further delivery pending. Seems a positive if a little wasteful process..that works to my advantage and for that I thank you."

In future I am now checking my bank account online every month and in future when I sign up with any of these multinational conglomerate companies who are not actually providing a service to the community but conning consumers out of hard earned cash to feed their ever more greedy shareholders and CEOs ..I will make sure I have a screen shot of everything to do with the contract kept in a folder available for reference next time.. but not with nowtv.. are they all the same?..

101827,"Not even a customer yet and already faced issues.
Talk talk sales person came to my door last week & signed me up - verified my details etc via call centre.

1 week later I receive a message from Openreach on behalf of Talktalk, to confirm when they can connect my ""Future Fibre"". This is the first Contact I have on behalf of TT. Nothing in the post or email to confirm anything else up to this point so of course I am concerned already.

In the meantime TT have cancelled my existing Broadband with BT, as well as arranged for Openreach to visit (which I called TT about to confirm as legitimate).

When I call TT to confirm if the message from Openreach is correct they are not able to verify my details. Because they are unable to verify my details - they cannot pass me on to a resolution team. No supervisor / manager able to assist either - all because they were unable to verify my details.

So my question is - if TalkTalk were able to cancel my existing broadband, arrange with Openreach to visit me (via text message), how were they not able to verify my details?

GDPR / Ofcom will receive a severe complaint from me on behalf of this company who clearly are not the ""Future"" of broadband providers."

Update-Their standard reply means nothing as they have told me it will be another month(and I'll believe it when I see it) before I get my money back unless they would like to prove otherwise,in which case I will amend my review!"
107593,"Due to the switch-off of analogue phone lines looming, I wanted to enquire about how to move to the new environment, whilst retaining my current requirements.
As I couldn't find an answer online, and BT don't publish email contacts for their services, and I wanted to review written information, not talk to someone for 30 minutes with 30 minutes waiting and then still ""just"" need the information in writing, I ended up emailing the CEO.
A month later, and from what I have been told, BT cannot provide written information about their services to anyone; (I think I was told) only BT customers could get web information, and they cannot point me to web pages that would help.
I have also asked for the complaints manager,'s email and name and that request was ignored in total.
The whole point of a website is to help (potential) customers find out if they can get what they want from that company, yet BT seem to think their website is for their convenience and not to help people interested in handing them business.
It would not take a miracle to have me take their services, despite me making clear that all they had to do to have my business was not to mess up! Oh well, BT have lost my business for a second time.
===============
Dan, Thank you for your response, but email is the only pragmatic medium for me, as I don't ""do"" Twitbook...
If you can give me your email, perhaps you can provide the information your colleague has refused to.
If you cannot help, then a phone call/ text/ Twitbook won't help even if I used them.
==============
Dan,
Are you able to support a potential customer, or does BT not want new customers, by refusing to provide any information to help make a decision, or to direct me to a package that will allow me to select your services - bearing in mind, that by now, potentially you could have had my business rather than driving a potential customer to a competitor."

They told me but instead of delivery I had a phone call on my mobile to say they couldn't deliver and would reschedule. The mobile reception was poor and the call kept dropping off so it was difficult to understand what the customer service operative was saying so I repeatedly asked him to call me on my landline but he just disconnected me. I believed the new delivery was to be on Thursday 18th August but as I had not heard about a delivery slot by Wednesday pm I again called customer service to check and was told I should be getting my delivery.
Two delivery men arrived about 10am today with my new freezer. These men from the Huntingdon depot were polite, helpful and could not be faulted in any way and were a pleasure to deal with.
As for the previous customer service - it just wasn't and I'm not sure I would want to deal with this company again. I would have given a much lower score if it wasn't for the delivery men."

June 6th - Washing Machine due for arrival but, upon arrival, driver says it is damaged so offers to rebook with another machine the next day.
June 7th - Another delivery arrive and because my 72 year old Mum answers the door with a face mask, they are spooked. She asks where their PPE is and they have ""run out"". The driver says they will get the office to arrange a return date.
June 9th - After hearing nothing, I call and explain that the delivery team were unprofessional, ill equipped and have clearly not arranged a return visit. A new date of the 10th June is booked.
June 10th - No Delivery. Another call takes place where I quite frankly, lose my rag and tell them that this incompetence is ridiculous. I explain the events of the 7th and am informed that the driver has told them the lady is self isolating. She is NOT self isolating. I am told that another delivery will happen on the 12th.
June 11th - I check the Order Tracking website and see that no delivery is booked for the 12th. I call and after finally getting through I am cut off after 44 minutes.

I am now waiting to see if anything arrives tomorrow but this experience has done my mental health no good whatsoever. I have to admit, I'm broken by the experience and have no desire to ever buy from Currys again."

I would give them five stars but object to the fact that if you call an engineer out because of a suspected problem on your landline they'll charge you a hefty sum if they can't find one which means that, as I'm a pensioner, I've even bought a new inexpensive phone rather than risk that particular rip-off."

Now almost two months after the first contract i still have no internet. They ""offered"" unlimited data to my phone so that i can work from home which sucks as the speed is less than what i had 20 years ago. I have easily spent over 50 hours chatting and calling them.

The worst ever service in my life. It could not be worse than this, very unknowledgeable and unprofessional staff. My TV was broken, I sent it two times, but they sent it back to me without repairing it advising that it has been fixed. Almost every day I call them, and no one knows and able to solve the problem and they transfer you from one team to another, I have spoken with seven people in one call as to whomever I spoke s/he was saying that it belongs to another team and would transfer me to another person and I was providing all security and other information each one of them soooooooooooooo annoyingggggggggggggggggg, but still no one was able to help. Wasted too much of my time and still wasting. I just spoke with one of them and he advised that the person who has sent an email to the other team is off and whenever she is back, she will be able to advise whether that team replied to the email or not as the email was sent from her personal email and other dont have access to it, how funny is that? Same in the shop they whether use personal emails and whenever you go if that person is off or for any reason not in the shop then no one else is able to provide any information. One of their managers in the shop used the general email address and had the response back at the same day, but he did not check the email for three days while I was waiting to hear from him and after three days when I went to the shop and by the time he saw me he checked the email and replied back to the email. When I asked him, he lied to me saying that he replied back on Friday and still waiting, I told him no you just replied, but he said no I replied back on Friday. The next day when I went again the manager was not there and his colleagues printed the emails for me and I saw that he replied to the email on the day when I went there. The next day I went again, and another person was in the helpdesk so I asked him for an update he checked the computer and said there are 3000 emails, and he can’t find out if there is any update or not and advised that his colleagues will get back to me. Finally, from my experience I would say very unknowledgeable and unprofessional team and the worst service, I have been affected emotionally, financially and a lot of my time has been wasted.
Every time I called or visited them I have told them that I have three kids and am mostly working from home and the TV help entertaining and keeping my children busy for sometime so I do my work or attend team meetings, but they have not cared about it."

196995,"Appalling customer service.

I went abroad with 12GB of data and received a message after 7 days that I had used 8GB from WhatsApp and Google maps. I then bought an unlimited data package as the sales assistant had told me I could top up.

The data then completely stopped working and I had no means of navigating around a foreign country. I contacted customer service 4 times and was told every time that I was a liar and that I had used all my data. Only when the package refreshed did they realise that it couldn't connect to a local network. However they still insisted I had used all my data and refused to refund me for the unlimited data.

I also had a horrendous experience in 2018 when a contract I pay for got a bill for £300 despite me requesting that data roaming be completely deactivated and told it had been. More fool me for going back."
166702,"Ordered a mobile in May. No phone appeared, given lots of excuses. Agreed they could not supply product by 3 weeks. No refund . 2 dates promised.Yesterday was last one ...no money seen in account today. DO NOT GIVE THIS COMPANY YOUR MONEY .

I now have my refund...but only after this post which is a shame. I had used them before and been happy."
124791,"They are advertising/selling strimmer blades on Amazon so as I needed them to cut my grass I naturally ordered them thinking they would be good quality from a known brand. When I ordered I naturally assumed it would be a pack of 20 as that's the going number for them in the retail package, I got one single blade!

I thought it was a joke or that the package is damaged but no! Who in their right mind would pay £4 for a single blade that lasts 5 minuities at most, its it same price as a retail pack of 20 everywhere else!

I would think that this is a mistake but I had an instant refund from Amazon so this leads me to believe that this is a dubious practice at best.

Disgusting, wont be using this company again.

*Reply to Response*

Finding the seller details is difficult on Amazon but the package/bag has PartsCentre.co.uk all over it and it has not been re-used so someone is lying or using your business name to sell goods."

183202,"I took my Google pixel 4 XL in for repair at Carphone warehouse, because there was a problem with the battery and the software. I'd also dropped it and cracked the screen, which voided three warranty, which sucked, but I'd made my peace with it. 2 weeks later I collected my phone, was told that I'd need to charge it when I got home, and was billed £170. I got home and charged it and it wouldn't turn on. Took it back to the shop and they shrugged their shoulders as if to suggest this isn't unusual. They wouldn't refund my £170 and now my phone has been sent back to the rank rotten amateurs who were unable to fix it the first time.

Update 6th October
I got my repaired phone back today. It's the wrong colour. They've given me a new phone, tried to pass it off as a repaired phone, and weren't even able to pick the correct colour. Clearly no Mensa candidates working at Team knowhow"
198706,"TV was delivered to a completely different address. It took ages to convince Argos that we never did receive it. Finally a friendly neighbour told us that the tv had been literally dumped in their driveway (several hundred yards away from our house). Argos were apologetic and promised a £25 refund for our trouble - I got an email saying they'd processed our refund but we never did get it. When I called to follow up I was told that they had decided not to give us the refund after all because we had officially 'received' the tv! I was upset and angry that they hadn't even bothered to tell me this (I only found out because I'd called to follow up) so they hung up on me. Second person I talked to (to complain about the hanging up experience) was very apologetic and promised a refund would be issued, but I'm not sure what to believe at this point. I do not recommend shopping at Argos online - the trouble we have gone to over this far outweigh the benefits of a cheaper deal."
100520,Easy to order and notification of despatch via email for my chosen delivery date. Would have liked the option to extend the warranty but overall happy with my purchase as Hughes price was £40 cheaper than most other online electronic retailers. Delivery was two days late but it is Christmas and APC had a nightmare when a driver returned to depot after drop 10 (mine was drop 54) and walked out.

194301,"Collection - No attempt to collect on the date booked for collection. Phoned regarding the non-collection, told it would be for following day. Didn't get a 4-hour window when it would be collected sent to me, so phone in the morning, and given a 4 hour window. Wasn't collected, so phone again, got a date booked for the following day. This time got a 4-hour window, and the TV was actually collected early after the people collecting phoned me (a positive). Three days after collection, got a text confirming it was with TeamKnowHow (TKH).

""Repair"" - Checked the TKH’s ""TrackIt"" site 7 days after my TV was collected. Phone up, as the site was saying ""contact required"" - no text or other contact was made - and was informed that it had been looked at and would get an update. Waited 2 days before phoning again, as nothing had changed on the website and was due back the following day, for an update. Was told I would not be getting my TV back the following day, as there were issues regarding the repair and could possibly be ""written off"". Have not agreed to the TV being ""written off"". Later get a text with a 4-hour window for the following day. Phone back again to see what was happen. Again, I was told TV would not be returned, and could possibly be ""written off"" - again did not agree to it being ""written off"" and told to that I will get an update. Got a 2nd text stating that it would be returned. Checking the “TrackIt” site, it still stated “Contact Required” as well as the TV was due to be returned the following day! Choose to leave it there and wait to see what happened the following day

Received a missed called during the 4-hour window the TV was due to be returned it. Phoned TKH 10 mins after the 4-hour window had passed, to see if it was to be returned - I had been told it wasn't going to be return on the phone and 2 text saying was going to be, so had no idea if it was due to be returned, or not. Was told it was still with the repair team and the was questions about the repair. Checked TKH’s “deliveryupdate” site (the one sent with the collection texts) and it showed/implied that the TV had been returned, which it has not. Phone up again, asked if I had agreed to it being “written off”, to which I stated I had not, and that I wished to have it repaired. I did explain with the conflicting message I am getting (TV to be returned via text, told it wasn’t over the phone, that it had been returned and that it was still with TKH), thus I was not 100% sure where or what was going on – the operator appeared to understand my position (another positive). An email has apparently been sent to the repair team, asking them to contact me – they have yet to do so, so cannot say they have, have not, will or will not contact me!

TLDR – TV Collected 2 days later, and when collected was collected earlier with contact from those picking it up. No contact regarding need to me to contact TKN, or to save me phoning them to discuss issues regarding repair. Told there is an issue, TV could be “written off” and told to wait for an update. Got texts saying my TV would be returned on the date it was due to be returned, got told it wasn’t going to be returned, implied it had been returned and told it was with the TKN’s repair team. Some of the people I have spoken to have been understanding."

I keep getting 'late payment' emails even though I don't use their services anymore and I know my new provider informed them of the change.

Today I got another text message and raised it on Twitter as clearly Live Chat wasn't working. They stopped replying.

Edit: Now they keep calling me which is weird as I explicitly said that I am hard of hearing in all their disability forms and they have repeatedly not allowed my partner to speak on my behalf.

I honestly don't know what to do at this point other than take it to CIDAS."

Virgin can’t fix it and have sent so many people round I’ve given up taking days off work to wait when sometimes no one turns up and they can’t be bothered to let you know.

Received a ‘corporate’ reply which doesn’t fix the issue.

This is clear from all the other emails from 'Ryan'..... Team KnowHow do not address or attempt to resolve issues in these 'responses' . Team KnowHow have failed to respond and deal with the issue despite two complaint codes they issued themselves to me in two emails noting their reception of my notification of a faulty new TV needing uplifting and replacing on 10 April and 25 April - YES FICTIONAL RYAN I DO STILL NEED YOUR HELP IN RESOLVING THIS.

I have spent several hours on the phone on many occasions. Despite promises to send a lead it has never arrived. I still have no home phone despite paying for it.

128233,"Prior to getting a PC from here, I had a Lenovo laptop which worked pretty well, although the company were not transparent and canceled its building process without telling us before the hinge eventually broke, stopping me from opening/closing it, so I decided to look into a different company that isn't a larger, international brand after trying to reach out to repair shops to get it fixed for God knows how long.

Ordering was incredibly straightforward and there was plentiful to choose from - I did even have a couple of questions I got answered by Sam in Live Chat, and they gave me answers that were straight to the point, making the chat short and sweet with no extra nonsense or long waits which I'd heard of with other companies. Since dispatch was scheduled for a date I was away from home, I reached out to enquiries and got a swift response from Stephen McCamley the following morning (as I sent the email at 8 in the evening) saying the date had been pushed back and to expect it 1-2 days after due to it being a bank holiday. Again, no extra nonsense, the response was short and sweet.

He didn't end up being wrong either - as soon as I received an email saying my order had been dispatched, I got it the very next day; and good grief, it's several times better than I expected, especially considering the parts I got weren't in high demand (Intel 11th gen i5, six cores and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti). I'm incredibly happy that I can go back to doing plenty of multitasking and playing high-end games without any problems.

If there was a small nitpick I had to make, it would be regarding the fact that the microphone and headphones jacks came separately rather than as one jack, which gave me a bit of a surprise when I got my PC and find I couldn't hear audio or speak through my headset microphone at the same time, so an option or prior notice about that would be nice. Although, because splitter cables are easy to get and I have one now, it does not change my opinion on the actual PC and how wonderfully it works. Thank you to the entire team for providing such an incredible service!"

148229,"What has happened to Currys?

I have always used Currys since the 90s and they have been great historically but they have gone completely down the toilet.
I was mis sold a product, a tumble dryer that I discovered would not work in a low ambient temperature, and trying to arrange a refund/replacement has been the worst customer service experience I can remember.
Their call centre is full of the least helpful people I have ever spoken to. I was either cut off or just forwarded back to the main menu at least 4 times during the process. In the end I focused on we chat as I got more progress but I was told a complaint had been raised and that I would receive a call back within 72 hours. 5 days later and still nothing.
No method of escalation, no one available who speaks English clearly. All customer service clearly outsourced to the cheapest location possible. Absolutely appalling.
I will never shop at Currys again."

I made an agreement that I would pay them 99 for a phone. The next day I was told it was on the way. Text from bank to say I had gone over drawn and they had taken 499. At no point was it mentioned any other figure then 99. They have now had my money for over a week and I have no phone, Anglo they have told me I won’t be getting one. Quick to lie, take my money, no hurry to give the money back. Disgraceful!!! I would say appalling customer service but that would actually mean there was some level of customer service. I would not trust them to do the correct thing or to rectify it if there was a mistake, I can’t afford to take the risk of losing 500 randomly. Don’t think many people have that much spare cash at the minute. I would strongly urge you to think twice, can you afford a mistake like someone taking a random un agreed amount from your bank then having no commitment to pay it back??"
123855,"I purchased a JVC TV from Currys just over 2 years ago. At the time, I also took out a 5yr Extended Warranty just in case and I’m thankful that I did as a week ago I noticed the backlight of my TV was starting to play up.

I contacted Team Knowhow and explained the issue on Friday, they immediately arranged a collection for the following Monday to collect and repair my TV.

Unfortunately, my TV was unable to be repaired and was ‘written off’, I was informed of this within a couple of days of my TV being collected and received my voucher for the full amount of the purchase cost 24hrs later!

All in all, I’ve had a real pleasant experience with Team Knowhow and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to friends and family.

I’ve just been and purchased my new TV and once again have taken out a care plan just in case the worst should happen."

So if you are desperate for a game you will be very disappointed but I still play my PS3 as more of a hobby and it was only about £8 wasted. The deliver is also poor it came and never sent me an email it had been dispatched or on the way or even once I got them. So again if you don’t have much money or you are young I wouldn’t bother, I won’t be buying again either however again as an adult I wasn’t to fused its just good to know for future.

114184,"I’m a new customer who was a previous customer 20 years ago so still have the original Virgin cabling from the street to inside the house so was advised I wouldn’t need an engineer to install. Friggin BIG mistake as I do need one BUT can’t have one until 28 Feb 4 weeks after the Virgin hardware was ready to install and my Sky account finished.
Come on Virgin get yourselves sorted quickly and get an engineer for a brand new customer without tv or broadband now for a month.
Wish I’d not left Sky now.
Rubbish service from Virgin for a brand new customer

Tom, thanks for the Virgin response, quite the standard non-committal unhelpful response I’d expect to cover your backside.
However when I ordered my new package from virgin over the phone it was your salesperson who said I wouldn’t need an installation engineers as I already had a previous Virgin installation so I was put down for a QuickStart self installation option. Nobody mentioned that my old Virgin cabling might not be compatible with new virgin technology. So if you knew this, given that you’ve just stated it as your excuse then why on earth don’t your ‘fully trained’ sales people don’t know this like you do? Eh? Wriggle as much as want with your excuses Virgin cocked the order up! And even missed off the number transfer request!!!
Anyway in the mean time the Exec team have resolved the problem - yay! So thank you exec team."

144498,"I’ve just booked a repair with espares, having being let down by another company and, Yvonne, the customer service advisor, was incredibly helpful, empathetic and understanding about the resulting panic (due to waiting for a month for the other company) to get things organised before Christmas. The engineer was booked for tomorrow, then called 20 mins later to ask if he could come today! Yvonne couldn’t haven’t been more helpful and the service engineer, Mustufa, having just ordered the parts, will be back on Tuesday and was equally amazing. The professionalism and warmth from my initial contacts with Espares, has been fantastic. Highly recommend!"
166915,I am very satisfied. I will definitely come back for more orders from this seller. I recommend
134771,Very helpful with our request. Took a short while to go through the queue to be connected but after that the advisor helped us through our request

154586,"Firstly thankyou, very happy with my new PC. Whilst my PC was being built to my spec, I was kept informed of progress and likely delivery date.
PC arrived by original estimated delivery time.
Everything working like a dream and I thoroughly recommend PC Specialists Ltd"

128894,"I sent a letter to Virgin Media to give notice that I was moving house, to an area they do not serve, along with proof. They continued to bill me for a month after I had moved, despite the timely notice, and then sent in debt collectors. It turns out that they do not accept letters! You have to use their irritating (and difficult to navigate) on line chat system, which leaves no paper trail. Companies are legally required to accept post sent to their registered office!"
166448,"I purchased an LG american fridge freezer from currys in 2007 and agreed to take out the whatever happens warranty at the same time. Last week I had to call them out for the first time as it was making a horrible noise, the engineer arrived and said he needed to order 4 parts, yesterday another engineer arrived with only 2 of the 4 parts ordered he then found he needed the other 2 parts but informed me they are obsolete so he called the office and they agreed to write it off and send a voucher for a new one. The engineer informed me that it is overheating and not to use it so I now have no fridge freezer. I have now been told it will be at least another 5 days before i receive my voucher I explained that i have not got a working fridge so no way of keeping milk etc cold the customer service adviser said that not our problem we agree to give you a voucher for a replacement we dont agree a time scale. I have a 14 month old who drinks cows milk and no way of keeping this cold for her I live in a small village with no shop and am 15 miles away from a supermarket so cannot purchase fresh milk daily. I feel this is very poor service. I have a domestic and general policy for my washer dryer that broke beyond repair a few months ago it was written off at 9.30am and by 2pm a new one had been ordered which was delivered 48 hours later. When I eventually receive my voucher I will not be purchasing currys care plan I will be purchasing one from domestic and general I feel so let down by this how can they leave people without a working fridge for almost a week and that is before i get to order one and wait for delivery so all together it will be over a week. I asked to speak to a manager and advisor refused.
Update I am still waiting for this to be settled, the agreement says that I will receive a voucher to replace with a product of the same specification however the first voucher was not enough for the basic model, a second offer tonight will now buy the basic model but this is not the same spec as the one I have so not only do they mess you around they do not honor the agreement. I will be seeking legal action if this is not resolved soon."
186636,"App is borderline unusable. When trying to cast to tv, it connects but won't play episodes, sometimes plays but randomly disconnects, constant error codes etc.

Complained to customer service and received the most condescending reply of ""It's frustrating when things don't work like we want them to"". I pay for a service, it should work.

Impossible to get prompt replies, often left waiting days or over a week. Told them I was cancelling and they eventually replied with troubleshooting that I'd already tried, instead of addressing the specific error codes. Cancelled my membership and will not go back."
199091,"As well as being disabled, I am currently very ill with covid so going out is not an option. I placed an order for some groceries and healthcare products. Nothing I ordered came. Some items were missing altogether whilst others had been substituted for much cheaper alternatives. One item was refunded but I was told nothing could be done about the rest of the order. Total disgrace. Now issuing a charge back through paypal."
194824,Bought an iPhone 7 for my son's birthday. Arrived within a few days and not a mark on it. Not had any issues with it and my son loves it. Would highly recommend this company. Great phones and great prices
118473,"PC came superbly packaged with the motherboard board, manuals and accessories I requested. The PC itself was expertly put together with the requested power cables for the graphics card, which I already had to install in the new build, pre-installed to the PSU.

Very happy with this PC and would absolutely recommend PCSpecialist to anyone looking for a pre-built PC or laptop. Their website is very easy to use, allowing you to view, select and pick the parts you want without worrying about compatibility issues. Their customer support is excellent too, with replies received within a day of contacting them. Also, their site does a great job of telling you what is happening at each stage of the build process.

My PC took 13 days to be built and arrive from ordering it online and this was during December too. Superb stuff!"
104151,I always buy from Hughes. Never any problems
167455,"Stressful, unjust, unreasonable and aggressive.

Had to leave Vodafone as they could not provide a signal in the Derbyshire area. They fundamentally broke their service agreement and I was left without a signal for hours on a daily basis. Instead of being reasonable, engaging in discussion in order to come to a civil agreement and maybe even leave the door open for a potential account in the future, they employed a debt collection agency about a week or so after my final invoice after my account cancellation.

I left for EE, never to return. Please stay clear of this company. Nothing but frustration and stress."
121886,Moved into a new flat and the old tenant had left a NOW TV box behind. I contacted their customer to find out how I could return it ethically (i.e. not put it in a landfill) and they told me I could either create an account and create a return label and send it back or just chuck it. I don't want to register to return someone else's property and I'm not throwing it in the landfill. The customer service representative kept urging me to throw it away. Incredibly disappointing in this day and age and a company clearly lacking in their corporate social responsibility. Have never used Now TV and definitely won't now.
116501,"Wouldn’t swap for new when arrived faulty, kept sending parts and although I’ve complained at least three times about this, including putting a bad review, they answer the review saying how sorry they are and to ring, so I rang as another part went (only had it a couple of months now) went through everything and would still only replace the part, unfortunately I think I have received a completely faulty vacuum set, it happens but most companies would replace if it didn’t work properly from day one, on the good side, the customer service is open seven days a week and they send the spare parts the very next day, I have had gtech before and not had a problem, so either they have gone downhill on quality or I just have a faulty one,
and wow another reply, this time to say comments noted, what does that mean, it means nothing will be done about it!!"
134533,Had a problem with my order and needed to return it. No problem getting a full refund though. Appreciated the good customer service
146779,"I purchased a MacBook Pro in 2019 that developed a well known fault. I am a student and so this was a particularly expensive purchase for me for Uni work. As I bought it in Currys, Shrewsbury I had no choice but to use the retailers Team Knowhow and not Apple directly. Little did I realise they 'don't knowhow' until recently. The team apparently completed a diagnostics check and determined there was water damage within the MacBook and I would have to cover any repair costs under warranty. This was a a bit of a shock. I stated at the time, there was categorically no water damage at all at any point. I sought picture proof to which I had to sign a privacy statement, this never arrived for completion when I could not locate it on their site. Out of curiosity, I approached an independent who checked for water damage and he stated the moisture detection elements had been removed. In total disbelief, we approached the Apple Store for verification. They were given no knowledge of my backstory other than I was exhausted with Currys service. To my disbelief Apple also confirmed there was no sign of water damage, nor had there ever been. Because, at the time I had to accept the KnowHow's word from supposed trusted individuals, I now have a MacBook that could easily have received a repair under warranty, had it not been for the lies that appear on the investigation report of water damage. Lesson has been learnt to never purchase from Currys again and go direct to the maker as I have done since. I have referred this to the Retail Ombudsman as I believe their integrity is questionable and may well equate to criminal damage."
120303,"I would like to give your ZERO star as I would like to stop the service after the contract date. I tried to call them earlier than the 30 days minimum notice period, but they refused to handle the case!!! It is a terrible company.

133048,"The delivery guys were friendly and efficient and kept me informed about the time they would arrive. This is so helpful.

The price quoted wasn’t the best available but they honoured their price promise and beat the lowest available. No wriggle or nonsense excuses!

The purchase was a relaxed and a no pressure process. I’m a happy customer and Richer Sound are my first choice when I’m looking for my kit."

186274,"Good service from PC Specialist. This was a custom-build PC, and there was some confusion about whether an Optical drive would fit the case I chose, and in the end I can't install it because the CPU cooler is in the way. Hey ho.

163559,"Did a phone trade in. Sent 25th October, all tracked and recieved. Downgraded the offer to alleged screen burn. Accepted the revised offer and still haven't been paid. Their terms and conditions state payment to be made in 3 working days and it's now 14th November so they are in Breach. Rung them and they were unable to give me any clear answers and to wait a further 3-5 days for payment. They also don't reply to any emails nor does the call centre let you speak to the trade in team. I'm not hopeful I'm going to be paid so I'm preparing to report them to trading standards and the consumer Ombudsman have effectively stolen my phone. Do not use them, choose another trade in company, even if they offer less as your time will be spent chasing them and not getting paid. Very unreliable and operating as thieves as they do not pay you for your phone. Do not use."

The items were delivered and within 2 mins one of the delivery men shouts “oh misses there is a problem “ I went into the kitchen to see what the “problem “ was and was told the oven doesn’t fit bear in mind it was swapping the old oven for a new one I had the dimensions of the old one and they were exactly the same as the new one one of these guys was measuring the new oven while still in its packaging I was then told I would have to move the gas pipe and would have to rewire the electrics in the house because the wiring was old and would start to blow bulbs etc the house is a new build and not even EIGHT years old and still in warranty!! These guys were told this to which the reply was “oh well maybe you’ll be lucky “ couldn’t wait to get them out the house as they were totally at it once they left my husband took the new oven out the packaging and measured the ovens guess what exact same size now I’m wise enough to know a con when I hear it but what if these chancers told the same lies to an old or vulnerable person “ team know how?

Would be nice if they phoned me every now and again to see if everything is ok. But you call them good luck if they speak English and or understand you.
127083,"Openreach failed to install a fibre line on 14 November 2022 as arranged. Long story short, and after many calls and live chats, Vodafone told me they would phone me 7 December. They didn't, so I contacted them and failed to get any proper answers or a new appointment for installation.

I was, however, told the matter had been ""escalated"" and assured this meant work would begin by 15 December. This was a cheeky porky pie, as it is now 21 December and I am still without a fibre line and WiFi.

I got a text from Openreach on the 16 December offering me an appointment for 30 December, which I accepted. I later called Vodafone to ask them for an earlier appointment, as I had been waiting over a month and deserved an appointment as quickly as possible. Especially since I did not want to spend Christmas disconnected from friends and family.

The agent proceeded to then book me an appointment for 8 February 2023(!), without me asking and without good reason, which automatically cancelled the appointment I'd had for 30 December.

After explaining this to them countless times and having them ""escalate"" it three times now, every employee I've spoke to simply tells me there is nothing they can do to get my 30 December appointment back and they can only offer me 8 February and there's nothing else they can do.

The stress has made me ill and now I'm spending Christmas disconnected from friends and family, unable to even stream something to watch. My internet could have, and should have, been connected 14 November.

Between Openreach and Vodafone, customers are just expected to endure endless incompetence, disrespect, lies, delays, and excuses. It's wrong and it's sick. I am talking to my solicitor to discuss options."

Do you get a response when you raise a Complaint - have raised about 5 and not heard a thing from any one of them...
Sent an email - Ignored!
So I cancelled my Direct Debit, thought maybe that would trigger a call - Nope...
What it did do though was have them SWITCH OFF my Supply because the payment is 10 Days late - 18 months I have been with them, never been late on a payment but 10 Days late and they switch you off...
I work from home too so had to call and make a payment plus the £12 late fee and was there an apology for the unattended appointments, an apology for the unanswered complaints, an explanation as to why they have the worst customer service record in the industry? No - Pay it and we will switch you back on...

Have contacted Ofcom already about this sickening attitude towards ""Customer Service""

From October when Studio bring there Christmas experience out.....There always seems to be bad reviews on Trustpilot. I get i it, you ring customer service, it goes to an offshore team, that can just about understand english.
You try and communicate with these people in the call center, either they are rude, or will terminate the call. They lack empathy and commuication skills.

THIS IS LIKE BEING IN A HOSTAGE SITUATION

we as customers are meant to have a hassle free shopping experience, Christmas is the most busiest time of year for all us customers that want our olders.

Please remember, its like going into a toy store, we want it, and we want it now. or at least we want answers to where our olders are.

There Warehouse is in Accrington in the North West of england, every year i can only imagine that they never take on enough staff.

There delivery company is EVRI, which use to be the old HERMES...again thats like being in another HOSTAGE situation.....waiting for your parcel, This company are Greedy, they have so many contracts, with many retail and other mail older companies.

Studio have many good reviews, and they will do there best to sort out your inquiry, but dont hold your breath.... They need to bring the call centre back to onshore....England..

160060,"Absolute nightmare of a company!

I had my TV collected on 28th October. I was told I would have it back within 7 days but I stated I cannot have it redelivered during the week as I am at work. They then decided to book my delivery for Thursday 4th November and of course I was not in. I spoke to the delivery driver in the phone and he said he would rebook it for me to be delivered in Saturday.

On Saturday (yesterday) I called up as I hadn't received a text or anything. They look on the system to say it hasn't been rebooted and that now I have to wait until 13th November (a total 16 days) I asked if I could collect, I was told no. I was then told if I had dropped my TV at currys I could have collected it also - why I wasn't told this when I originally booked in the repair I do not know!

I followed this phonecall with a call to the delivery driver to see if he did book it in. He reassured me he did book it in and that it would definitely be with me yesterday.

I called back knowhow, told them this and filled a formal complaint. I was then told the delivery team have a different booking system that they can't access so it may turn up pr it may not as they can't check. They told me to wait in all day and see!

I rearranged the delivery for 13th November as it seemed there was nothing else I could do. This morning, I then received a text at 7.30am to say my delivery has been reorganised for Wednesday 10th November - I'LL BE AT WORK!!!!!

So yet again this morning I have had to call up again to rearrange the delivery for the 13th November when I will actually be at home! I'm just hoping I actually get my TV back next weekend now - what an absolute joke. I should be given a new TV after all thos hassle and as their T&C say 7 days 🙄"
142590,Delivered early on release date which i was pleased with
136248,Rang up to cancel my contract to virgin. Then spent 90 mins just trying to cancel and said 'I just want to cancel' about 30 times. How can it take so long.
104484,"After suffering extremely bad network services from Vodafone, I had to finally call them and make a complaint! So it turns out that they have got major works going on, but get this, no end date at the moment! So just have to ride it out! Also not shown on their website, also can’t leave! Has to be 1 whole month of reduced services before I can leave, it’s already been over a month but it starts from today! What a dirty company/corporation! I feel shame even dealing with these capitalist vampires! At my earliest opportunity I will be leaving! And will forever warn people of Vodafone! Look at the total score on Trustpilot! It’s dismal!"
132353,The staff are excellent. They are knowledgeable about the products and were extremely helpful when I decided that my purchase was not really suitable for my needs.
131988,I ordered a new phone online from carphone warehouse. The payment was paused by the bank as a fraud check - easily solved until someone at carphone warehouse decided to try to take a second payment without authorisation from me or my bank causing a high level fraud warning and as a result my accounts were frozen and cards cancelled. No one at carphone warehouse seemed to care and just wanted to pass me to the next dept. When I finally spoke to someone who could cancel the order I was told they are unable to send any kind of written confirmation of this - even an email is to much for them!!! so I just have to take the word of a company that was quite happy to assume they could process multiple payments from my account without authorisation.... The highest level fraud team at my bank has confirmed this is fraud in thir eyes.... STEER WELL CLEAR!!!

188790,So I just discovered you cannot read the restaurant reviews...only the restaurants can see them. That is astonishing and non transparent and makes me rethink using this app. Twice now I have ordered food based on star rating but the quality was horrible. Now I am thinking about placing another order but without seeing what other customers are saying...yeah no thanks!
196681,"Great product, great price, arrived in time."
190003,It would be good if it worked last month went down 4 time and still got charged my full bill not happy
161057,"absolute joke. I'm calling them now whilst i type this and have been on the phone for 2 hours. One department to another. The call keeps dropping, and I can't understand what they are saying because of the accent. This is a joke."
129764,After really poor service and after chatting to customer service I was offered a refund of £20.90 which should have meant the payment came down to just over £11. I got an e-mail saying the refund was just over £11 so I chatted again the young lady said sorry for the confusion but assured me the refund was £20.90. The bill hit my bank account this morning and the refund was just over £11. So not only is Deliveroo service extremely bad but their customer service employees lie to get rid of you. Unfortunately you can't give less than 1 star

101288,"Have contacted talktalk multiple times when my Internet went down and almost 4 weeks later still not resolved.

When asked for a callback after being frustrated that I was wasting hours and hours speaking to the wrong people they Initially declined and then was told they can! And I would receive one 24-48 hours later. 4 days later I contact them! When it works it's fine but if you have a problem then all the best as you won't get it sorted quickly. Very disappointed with the service and lack of communication on this issue. Have been very patient but enough is enough!"

133780,"HAPPY TO SAY THAT MY ISSUE BELOW HAS NOW BEEN RESOLVED SATISFACTORILY. THANK YOU
I purchased a Tefal Loft toaster from currys_pcworld on eBay on 25/2/2021. The item was marked as dispatched on 11/3/21 and arrived a few days later. I unpacked the toaster and started using it. On 3/4/21 I noticed a couple of small pieces of red plastic on the work surface near the toaster. Close inspection of the bottom of the toaster showed a crack in the casing. As I had not dropped or banged the toaster I can only assume that the item was damaged on arrival and it went unnoticed by myself as it was on the bottom of the toaster. I started a return on eBay on 3/4/21 and received notification that my return had been accepted and I was to ring Team Knowhow for a returns label. I did this on 6/4/21 and was told that as it was more than 28 days since I had ordered the item it could not be returned even though it was faulty/damaged. I agreed that it was more than 28 days since placing the order but as it was not dispatched until 11/3/21 it was not more than 28 days since I had received it. I was advised that even though that was the case a return still could not be processed. I find this very unsatisfactory as I was not requesting the return due to not liking the item but because it was damaged. I would very much appreciate it if a return could be actioned."
189298,"Well got connected to these suppliers last week, they installed a great big box on the front of the house that we were not informed about and because the box is there they had to put the router at the same side as the big box. Now my phone is in the spare bedroom with the router, so we can't hear the phone so it's disconnected so we are paying for something we can no longer use. Then come to connect security camera the router is to far for it to get a signal. My husband told them we needed it at the back of the house but they did what was the easiest for them now I have to sort something out to connect my security cameras. What a pain in the backside, I could do without this hassle just before Xmas. So my advice to anyone who is due to change to them make sure you get them to put this big box where you need your Internet to connect to everything :-("
184457,"If I could have given a lower score then I would have. We opted for NOWTV specifically for coverage of the darts championship at Alexandra Palace over Xmas. It quickly became apparent that we had wasted our money with massive connectivity and buffering issues which caused us to miss large chunks of each match played even though our other streaming services (Netflix, Amazon) were fine. It was so bad that were unable to view much of the semi final and all of the final. Utter garbage and certainly not fit for purpose - stay away from these guys! Rip off!"

Had 5 engineer visits and each time a different part is ordered although the engineers haven’t fitted any of them as it’s always a different engineer and they say it’s the wrong part and order another.

This was while I was sitting with a clear view of my front drive and they hadn't even attempted to deliver them.
Took GHD a week to respond and
now a paper form needs to be completed and sent back by post to put a claim in for ""lost in post""
Utterly ridiculous!!
The onus should be on the courier to prove delivery to prevent this happening. Not the customer being asked to fill out paperwork that mentions false claims being treated as fraudulent. Do GHD think we're liars?
We'll be buying elsewhere when the refund is provided.
Appalling service.
Maybe stop using Evri too, they're notorious for parcels ""vanishing"""

The machine is exactly what I wanted for a dedicated sim racing desktop, quiet and blazingly quick.

169477,Spent hours on the phone and live chat to resolve what i thought was a minor problem after i had signed up to carphone warehouse and ee tariff. Both was passing the buck and so i returned the mobile and cancelled the contract. After carphone warehouse had the mobile for a week and no contact i phoned and asked about my upfront payment. They had forgot. Still its in the post in the form of a cheque which could take up to 28 days to reach my address. It came off my account in an instant. My advice to anyone would be to stay clear of carphone warehouse as thier customer service is shocking starting from wrong information when buying and misinformation in problem solving.
107508,"The tv is ok not impressed with the stand . The delivery man called when I was out and phoned me, said he couldn’t deliver another day so asked for my sons place of work dvd dropped it off there. Son had to get a taxi home. Not sure if this is great or a pain in the bum. Unusual."

Sent me a phone after THEY DECLINED my order, and then A WHOLE WEEK LATER, no warning OR ANYTHING, I'm sent a phone, just a text from DPD. No email from them, nothing. So pissed. How the hell are you going to DECLINE my order and then make it my fault when you mess up. Awful. Would never in my life go through them again."

102280,"Further to my last Trust Pilot review of the 11th Oct 2022. I sent this further email to TalkTalk CEO on the 30th of December I have had no reply.

Dear Tristia Harrison (Ben Thompson),

Further to your last email. I inform you that due to my Aunt having no TalkTalk telephone or TV service for such a long time and a 98yr olds complete reliance for medical help on a working telephone, once you finally restored her telephone she was medically in such a poor condition that Doctors and Nurses convinced her that due to being not able to call for medical help, her medical condition had so drastically deteriorated that she was rushed to hospital and died on the 7th November 2022.

So, from an active 98yr old living alone in mid-September due to no telephone/TV etc, her health deteriorate so much that she was rushed to hospital once her TalkTalk telephone/internet service was repaired and died in early November.

What did TalkTalk do after being contacted dozens of times, they kept on taking money for a service that they did not supply even taking money out of her account the day after she died and despite being told more than once that she was dead, we have again received today a bill payment due next year two months after her death for a TalkTalk telephone/internet/TV service to a house that has been empty since October.

Please can I have a reply as I have so many people following this never-ending Saga."
181603,Good on delivery but the support team just won't give me paperwork on the extended warranties. Seems like they just fob me of to someone else.

Engineer arrived again today with wrong part which he knew it was, after a phone call to someone told us he was writing the cooker off and apologised for the experience we've had. 10mins after he left we get a phone call again to say parts are being ordered to repair!!!! as the engineer didn't leave any paperwork as he said we would receive a voucher for a replacement cooker in the next 2 days we did not have proof of the conversation,even though he made a phone call to someone before he told us, apparently a technical manager has managed to find the parts??? this company is an absolute joke, put together the cost of engineer visits and parts ordered they might just as well have replaced the cooker in the first place. the only reason they get one star is for the phone call I had with a person called Miya who was so helpful and looked at the history of the repair and is going to investigate the service, lets hope I get the call back she promised me."

I researched the market and found a much cheaper deal with Now TV, which Vodaphone were unable to match. I resent entering into a contract which is broken by the company half way through the term and then charging a penalty for leaving early. I also have two vodaphone hubs which upon ringing vodaphone discovered they don't want returned by post or to their stores. Not very green, more electrical waste to landfill. Incidentally the phone call to Vodaphone took 20 minutes and I was passed from operator to operator on the simple question of what to do with the redundant hubs. Poor show Vodaphone.

So Vodaphone finally replied and said I can drop hubs off to a store, but i was advised categorically not to do so when phoning them. They didn't bother to repky to issue re. breach of contract."

I have purchased an android device (Samsung A70) on 29 June from Carphone Warehouse Westfield (Shepherds Bush) . I got charged GBP 369 twice!!! I immediately raised it to Store Manager Pam. She said she talked to IT and raised the issue . She also assured that I will get reimbursed withing 5-7 days because- in system- it clearly shows I got charged twice.

1 month passed by, nothing happened! Neither I got a call or got reimbursed. On 27 July, I went back to the samw westfield store and then store manager Mr. Inder ensured he will resolve this issue and give me a call the next day. 4 days passed. Still no response.

101676,"I took out an upgrade with Carphone Warehouse on the 4th December 2022. The phone arrived on the 6th December however it had a new sim and new number associated with it. I was told that as it was an upgrade, I would keep my existing number and billing details so contacted their support team, who quickly fobbed me off to Vodafone.

Upon contacting Vodafone, it was confirmed that a new contract had actually be taken out, alongside my existing one. i asked if the number could be swapped over, however was told this would take 30 days and during this time I would have to pay 2 contracts.

I then went into my local Carphone Warehouse store and was told ""It's an online issue, you'll have to deal with it online"", however he suggested I should upgrade there and then in store. This thought is laughable, that I would then be expected to pay another upfront cost and possibly have a third contract based on their previous attempts to upgrade me.

I then called the contact center again, explained the issue to the operator who confirmed that someone had made a mistake and started a new contract rather than an upgrade. She explained despite it being a Carphone Warehouse error, I would either have to pay the two contracts until Vodafone could swap my numbers, or alternatively return the phone and start again. Since I was not going to pay for 2 contracts, I chose the return option and started this process.

While on this call I was emailed a returns label for a DPD drop off, however explained to the operator I had no way of printing this. She suggested I ""go to an internet cafe to print it"", which is a ridiculous request, having to drive to an internet cafe to pay to print a label that was only needed due to a Carphone Warehouse mistake. I explained that this was not an option, so she said that with this label the DPD drop off store could print it for me, something I said was unlikely as they were all local corner shops. She was adamant this was the case, so the call ended there.

Upon driving to my local store, I was told that no they do not print the labels and it needs to be on the parcel already. I tried another store and had the same response.

At this point I was livid with Carphone Warehouse and the service they had given, so I called them again to see what I was supposed to do with this phone that I needed to return. Luckily this person was a little more helpful and explained DPD could collect the phone from me, with no label and arranged this for the 7th December. I will see tomorrow if they will collect it without a label.

Overall my experience with Carphone Warehouse has been shocking. They made a mistake on the order, have passed me from person to person, made me liable for 2 phone contracts (possibly effecting my credit score) and had a very poor attitude in resolving the issues. I have requested their management call me to discuss, however I am skeptical this will happen.

7/12/22 Update: They cancelled the collection with no explanation or update (simply a DPD link saying that it has been cancelled). I have tried contacting their social media as they have pointed others to do below, however just keep getting told you have to return it, ignoring the fact they cancel their collections when I try.

9/12/22 Update: They ask you to contact their social media, yet when you do they ignore you for hours at a time to respond with a scripted answer. When calling the call centre I was greeted with yet more useless scripted responses and considering they kept telling me they ""understand my frustration"" they clearly could not verbalize this understanding, into actually answering any questions.

15/12/22 Update: There social media team are useless, when i asked to raise a complaint with them they responded (eventually) with ""we are the social platform team, we can not help with that"".

Surprisingly, I have been charged for the second contract despite returning the phone to Carphone Warehouse last week. I spoke to their customer service team and was told I would have to speak to Vodafone directly as they had cancelled the contract on their end. I explained they would not talk to me as they needed to text a security code to the new number (which I no longer had as it had been returned) so could not verify my account. She said this was Vodafone issue and could not assist more, despite me being a customer of Carphone Warehouse.

I have made a complaint through their official complaints procedure on the phone, but highly doubt anything will be done, as it was just the operator noting what I had to say. On several occasions I have asked for their management team to call me but have received nothing,"
146198,"Worst customer service I have ever experienced through any company.
I received a phone call to say my contract was due for renewal, I hadn't decided what I wanted to do so I was told I could reduce my payments whilst I made a decision which I agreed. When I was told the contract would be with a different provider I questioned whether I could stay with my current provider as I didn't want the hassle of changing. I was told this couldn't be done so I reluctantly agreed, when I was told to text through a PAC code the message stated I would be charged for an early exit fee. I questioned this straight away and asked why I was being charged when my contract was up for renewal anyway? The assistant told me it was just the way the message was worded and I wouldn't be charged an exit fee it was my normal monthly fee plus a small amount that is added on for leaving the company. I thought this didn't sound correct but as I questioned it I wouldn't have thought a company would lie to a customer.
It turns out that is exactly what they did and that was just the beginning.
I received a phone call from my provider telling me that I would be charged for leaving early on top of my monthly payment and that I had been lied to. They then told me what I needed to do to cancel the new contract and that I needed to ask carphone warehouse to unlock to pac code. I was warned that if I was told they couldn't unlock the PAC code this is also a lie and that they can do it instantly on the phone.
After waiting on hold to customer services for 20 minutes I explained the situation and was immediately told they did not unlock PAC codes. Again I questioned this and said they needed to unlock the code. After going back and forth for a while the customer service person told me ""he didn't know what else he could say to me to make me believe him"" that it could not be unlocked - because I clearly didn't trust them at this point.
He assured me the contract had been cancelled and he had done everything his end. I asked whether my phone would continue with my current provider because I didn't want any further issues and was told not to put the new simcard in my phone and it wouldn't have any affect.
Low and behold today (the day my current provider told me the PAC code would not be able to be undone if carphone warehouse didn't unlock it for me) I have got no signal on my phone!! In a climate where I am relying on my phone for work and to communicate with people whilst we cannot do it in person is beyond disgraceful!
The fact I was lied to twice and the customer service person (Steven Albrecht) also didn't seem at all surprised I was lied to, or apologise for it, is absolutely disgusting. How can this company be satisfied with providing such disgraceful customer service?!
I have never complained about a company in my life, but then I have never been blatantly lied to either.
Do not use this company, they don't want to help you. They just want your commission.
This should be illegal, what if I am not in a position to pay the exit fee plus my monthly bill?! This is how people end up in awful situations because of greedy companies like this who based on the service I have had, I am sure wouldn't care less if I called them once I had been charged the fees if my provider hadn't contacted me!
You should be ashamed."
152733,"I have contacted TalkTalk live chat 3 times in the last 24 hrs to try and sort out a problem with my internet connection reliability and speed. They have kept me chatting for 4hrs in total and have not dealt with the problem. Each time I have complained I have been fobbed off with purchasing wifi extenders when the fact is everything was working well 3 days ago and now it isn't. Nothing has changed my end to create a speed problem. Extremely poor service, rude to terminate the chat without saying and this to a customer that has been with them for more than 15 years.

Dear Alina,
If 3 of your experts operatives have failed to deal with my issue, then resort to me purchasing wifi extenders which would be totally pointless. What help is your community page going to be!!!! This is just another example of fobbing the customer off instead of dealing with the issue. Something TalkTalk seams to be expert at. All I want is a phonemail off somebody who actually wants to sort the fault out. Not much to ask for a customer who has been with you for 15years."
161619,"I sent a message into your customer service asking why the deal I got was more expensive than on your website and no free brush and got no response. It seems if influencers promote your products then the deals are actually worse and we don’t know until we check. I also asked to be refunded if nothing could be done to rectify it.
No response GHD so poor service!
Still waiting."

It has stopped 4 times since, vodafone think its quite acceptable to give 3 days time to get it fixed while i'm incurring big costs hooking my laptop up to my mobile on hot spot .
Compensation what a joke less that £1 a day .
Poor service, brakes down often, customer services ok but takes at least 40 mins to get anything done.
and the ultimate joke when the recorded messages says do you know you can fix your broadband at home using www. .. what a pathetic system I dont even have internet so how the hell am I going to get onto the web site to fix it ?"

Was informed sometimes an excess fee is charged, which is ok, but upon contacting the team by phone I was informed there was no fee. Upon collecting my phone a fee was demanded.
Tried to converse with the team and they are basically calling me a liar and say their rep never said there would be no fee- it was the last thing said in the phone call. Absolute joke. As well pissing money against the wind. Money charged could have been used to fix the phone on my own accord, not to mention the money WASTED each month. Have canceled the policy now so won’t have to deal with their bullsh*t again. Lucky to get one star."

When I took out the package, I was offered 350mbit connection with a “Hub 5”. When supplied, I was given a “Hub 3”. My invoices even list my equipment as “Hub 5”

Trying to complain was a nightmare, very difficult to speak to someone who would listen. When I opened an official complaint, I received an email saying I had raised a complaint, then 5 minutes later another email saying my complaint had been closed. I immediately opened another complaint but it was ignored and no follow up was ever received. I spent over 2 hours on the phone doing all of this.

Avoid virgin media, they don’t listen and don’t care!!"

We rang back to say that there was in fact someone in the flat, but they said they couldn't come back the same day. Now we have to wait until next week, where we hope they will use some common sense and ring a bloody doorbell."

Why couldn't NowTV have done that? It's their job.
How much more professional were OpenReach? And NowTV blamed them!"

183113,First time using mazuma and wouldn't again. Sent an iphone 12 pro max and an apple watch. Phone was quoted 560 and watch 90. Apparently watch has a few scratches so they revised offer to 81 (not going to cry over £9) and to save hassle accepted it tho dispute it as watch had covers etc on it. Phone likewise alwaus covers on it and screen protector from day one. But again a few scratches they are saying so revisied offer to 445 (down from 560). Gen believe they are scam but can be hard to prove they are causing damage to the devices and they know it. Genuinely would use another company.

Gentlemen called ""Faris R"" from the beginning of our conversation he was polite and he apologized for not even his mistake. He had genuine interest and helped me out a lot. He even gone ""extra mile"" by advising of a new government scheme which should start from October 2022. As he didn't had more info he suggested to transfer me back to customer service and do some online research so I can get help with the bill. I can't thank enough to this person. This is called excellent customer service."
168425,"I was with this company for 2 years then I thought it is good idea to take them with me as I moving to another property. They did 3 mistakes while moving. I had to call literally 20 times and it appears they don't have any continuity of work. The customer service agents don't know anything about their work and when I asked to put to their manager they hang up. They made me start account 3 times and it didn't work . They keep saying that I need to give them more information but when I call each agent refer me to other agents with no progress. Really worst customer services ever. I am currently can't continue with them and can't switch to other. I think their service have zero monitoring and those agent are not trained to their jobs correctly. This problem has been going for 2 months, can you imagine the waste of time and energy"
147018,"I have been with Carphone Warehouse insurance fir my iPhones for the past 7 years but my most recent experience since they closed and re-opened has been so bad that I am not going to use them any more. Their supposed « max » turn around time when under warranty is supposed to be 28 days but after 43 days I got annoyed. When you try to complain all you get is a bunch of excuses about how one engineer needs to speak to another to approve a replacement phone. 5th call today and yet another 48 hour promise and a trading standards number that was a complete waste of time. It appears even complaining is a waste of time. They got everything about my repair details wrong and refuse to compensate me. I will no longer be using their service and would recommend that others do the same as no-one appears to give a toss about your £800 phone and when you are likely to get it back. It’s run by a lot of smiley young sweet people that are obviously used to people getting irritated as they are constantly saying sorry but are powerless to actually do anything to get your property actually returned to you. And don’t even bother trying to escalate to a manager, they are constantly in meetings and refuse to take any calls. An utterly useless Insurance service run by people that couldn’t give a monkeys about how inconvenient your life is without your mobile phone. I’m disgusted. Be warned ."

This was scheduled for Saturday 3/12/22 and I received a text a few days before confirming delivery between 7.30am and 9.30am and the driver would ring me an hour before delivery. Sat in all day, no phone call and no delivery. Rang Argos around 5.30pm and was told the depot was now closed and I would have to ring the next day for an explanation regarding non-delivery. Rang on 4/12/22 and was told again the depot was closed and to ring back the next day. Rang on the 5/12/22 and was told an investigation would be raised...still no explanation. Rang again today 6/12/22 and was told the driver ran out of delivery hours on Saturday and they can reschedule my delivery for 15/12/22 at the earliest as the goods are out of stock??

199647,"So far response to my query has been absolutely hopeless and I’m now on the third attempt to get an answer from people who don’t appear to understand a simple question/request to confirm a product dimensions.

If my experience thus far is any indication of the company as a whole I fail to see how they ever achieve a rating of 2 or even 3.

*** Update... so now being asked for further information.....

Hopefully someone that understands English will read this....

My issue is that my Stoves oven glass door is broken. Stoves made a slight design change of the door in 2015 which affected the size of the inner glass of the main oven door. This change slightly altered the size of the glass within the door. On eSpars website they advertise 2 different stock numbers for the glass I need but for the same Stoves oven model. One of the part numbers they give a dimension for but the other they don’t. I am simply asking them to measure the other one and tell me what the size of glass is. Not a difficult request but their staff just don’t seem to understand plain English.

As one previous review has queried are they in financial trouble and having looked on company’s house their accounts are long overdue which makes me concerned to place order and pay for something that may never get delivered or will, as many other reviewers have noted, made it difficult if not impossible to recover money when the product supplied is wrong or damaged on receipt.

Look on Companies House website for their details

I am thinking of writing directly to Mark Depper one of the directors of eSpares to bring this to his attention"

If it’s possible for you then it’s better to go to a store and check that you actually like a high value item before you buy, rather than just choosing online

Sent back to GHD who replaced them with no problem. Another 18 moths down the line and the same thing happened so sent back again during COVID and were once again replaced. Received the third pair and now two years later the SAME thing has happened but this time they won't replace them because the 2 year warranty has expired. Expect straighteners that's cost £100+ to last longer than 18 months - 2years when the £30 spare pair are 10+ years old and still work. Never again would I purchase a pair of GHD straighteners as it appears that after 2 years they stop working.

My wife was in the house but nobody knocked on the door. No message was sent regarding their arrival. Now a three week wait for another appointment, so need to take more time off work. Very frustrating."

She decided that I probably needed a replacement battery, and said that she would get one sent out to me. It arrived THE NEXT DAY!!! I was amazed and delighted. All now in working order. Very impressive. Didn't even have to wait long on the phone to speak to somebody! Well done Gtec"
191859,The whole of the ordering and payment was efficient and quick. There was no part of this transaction that could be faulted. The bonus was having a new phone in my hands in less than 24hrs. Thank you Envirofone

The engineer came and unfortunately wasn’t able to fix dryers. He wasted his time as my washer was ok . He sent me a report though to say it was working . I re arranged my dryer to be fixed after several phone calls and trying ti book on line , for the visit to be cancelled. I’ve had 2 days off work now for nothing . Hopefully Thursday the engineer will come out and fix my dryer ! You can’t speak to anyone just automated calls and a website which is always down !"
180274,I ordered a display PCB and control PCB for my faulty fridge freezer. These were delivered promptly and at a reasonable price. It turned out that I only required the display PCB so returned the control PCB and received a full refund.

108682,Charged after free trial - couldn’t use service as was terrible quality. 1 month free promo pass is effectively a sign up and we will keep charging you when you don’t cancel policy! No refund even when can see the service hasn’t been used! Avoid and tell others the same!

I ordered my PC after some deliberation over what components to include that would meet my budget, I ommitted the GPU since I was planning on sourcing that elsewhere, however was able to specify which GPU I was planning on using.
PC arrived and is superbly constructed, the cabling and internals are very neat and professionally finished. I have had no issues with the build whatsoever and my GPU fitting into the case very easily.
I would definitely recommend PC Specialist for anyone looking for a pre-build or partially prebuilt gaming PC (I have already suggested my brother do the same)."

155265,"I have had an awful experience with Argos South Ruislip. I contacted customer service by phone as I had purchased a laptop and 9 months later it stopped working. I was advised to get a fault code from manufacture and then come into store with this and receipt and product would be replaced. I called back again with the fault code and the agent reserved another laptop for me to exchange and again advised me of the same process. I went into store to be served by Sue who quite frankly provided appalling customer service. She was rude, made personal comments towards me & my children. She then got advice from her manager Paige who was just as rude. They then advised they would not exchange the laptop as they needed to send for a repair. I told them this was not the advice I had received from customer service, so I called customer service again who gave the same advice for a 3rd time. I advised I was in store and the manager was refusing to exchange. I asked him to contact the store and advise them he then went and checked with his manager and changed his advice to repair was required not exchange. I asked Sue & Paige to arrange the repair and Paige refused advising me should would be throwing my laptop in the bin. She asked me to leave the store and called security just because I was requesting my consumer rights. Security came and just stood there and did not advise me to leave the store as this was an unreasonable request. I am absolutely disgusted with how I have been treated and I now have no laptop repaired or replaced which I note is under warranty"

Broadband is an on off on off service. Their excuse? It must be a busy period. They then charged me extra for a booster to get a service that I already pay for. BTW the boosters are terrible also. I won’t go on about the staff but the three I have spoken to today should not be in a customer service based job."
173394,"One star is too good for this company.

Purchased an Oven from Currys and the insurance cover with Knowhow kicked in once the manufacturer warranty ended.

Had an issue with the oven in the final month of the Knowhow insurance and put in a claim. Engineer came out and we assumed it was fixed. Still had problems, had several engineers come out in the months that followed. By this time the insurance had expired but the claim was related to the original claims whilst the insurance was live. Had no oven over Christmas they were not sympathetic and have 3 kids, and now in Mid-Feb we are left with an oven that doesn't work properly, that they had partially fixed.

I have asked for a replacement but they refuse as the insurance is now not live, it was when I made the claim though. But they state as the insurance is not live now they are only obliged to repair it and not replace it.

They are sourcing the part and have been for months. We get text messages stating they have sourced the part and arrange a time for the repair. We stay in and then get a call from the engineer to say sorry we don't have the part. Even worse one time the engineer turned up with a second hand part to fix the oven, yes that is right a second hand part. He stated to me this was very unprofessional and he personally refused to fit a second hand part.

Currently they are looking for the part, I have asked for a date they think they can source the part and they can't give one. I have again said it looks like the part can't be sourced so it would be reasonable to replace the oven. They state back to me all they can do is repair the oven, but they can't without the part that they can't source at all or in a reasonable time. Meanwhile I am waiting for them to find a part that is near impossible to source, until then I had a defective oven. I could literally be waiting another few months.

I ask myself why did I buy the Team Knowhow insurance?

Ask yourself was this a waste of money."

Was offered 210 pounds for my Apple I phone 11 64gb then offered 170£
They said they had received it
And reported that it had scratches on the screen and chips on the case
Which is totally untrue the phone was in the case for 2 years with not a mark on the case and the screen had a quality screen saver for the same length of time
They suck you in with their high quotes and then try to trick you

168199,"Worst costumer service ever and signal is very poor..I don’t know how start my story with you guys..I’ve been with three from 2years ago I had 24 months contract I was paying every month on time even though signal is very bad I’ve never made a complain to the company but after what happen with me yesterday in Westfield store in London I was very upset and chocked about the way I was treated,literally I was scammed I felt like I’m dealing with random people in street market. I went there to upgrade my contract and I was looking for something Cheap and good deal as I was paying £72 pound every month so I asked the guy there he’s name is Han I think is a Chinese guy he said to me the cheapest deal we have for sim card is £23 pound a month I found it ok so we start to talk about the contract he was trying all he’s best to increase the money make pay for more things, I was clear with them that I don’t wanna pay any extra penny..anyways he print the contract for me and it was showing that I have half price for the first 6months he said oh no this offer is not available anymore!!! I didn’t get it and also I wasn’t stubborn I accepted peacefully. unfortunately I singed the contract and everything thenI left.my partner told me they could of make a good deal for you as you are not a new costumer I checked my app and I found out my bill is still £72 pound so I went back there just to check with them, I asked I different person she didn’t know I was there earlier she told me that they have a good offer if I wanna upgrade my contract and the offer is £11 a month🙄😳what I said to her ok now I need to speak with your manger because this is what happened suddenly I found all the staff around me every one is trying to explain him self on he’s own way the manager took my contract and went inside the office he came back with telling me look I’ve a made a good discount for you and you will be paying £11 for the first 6 months while another person singed a contract with me telling that we don’t have this deal anymore!! But the manager didn’t make any discount for me because the offer was available already..now I can’t do anything because they said if you wanna break the contract you will have to pay £400 pound which doesn’t make any sense to me I guess everyone knows about the return and a refund policy its worldwide and it’s not 14 days yet it was only this Sunday 21th of August honestly they are scammers and they have no manners I’ve been treated very bad.

Total sham buy products else where as these people have no customer serve skills"
105065,"Had the pleasure of dealing with Inez, in what I felt was a very stressful situation. I was made to feel at ease, Inez showed true empathy, truly listened to my concerns which reflected in the information in which I received, it was was above and beyond to what I was expecting. I came away feeling happier & relaxed, which was a great relief & a resolve to my query. Perfect... 5 stars not enough!"
132558,"I moved into a new flat and sorted broadband straight away as I’m currently studying and it’s more than important I have an internet connection. It took over a month for the box to be sent for it to not arrive, then they had to send another, it didn’t arrive… finally I had to get yet another to be sent to my parents address to finally receive it and they live 45 minutes away from me so had to drive to get it!

At this point I’m getting threatening emails from them saying if I have a new box then I need to return the previous ones and if I don’t I’ll be charged £50 to the card on my account.

When I did finally receive my box it didn’t have a cable it in, when I spoke to BT they then sent a new cable but it wasn’t the right one. This has gone on for 2 months now where I’ve had to buy a cable elsewhere and also spend a fortune on mobile data to hotspot off my mobile to be able to study.

This has been THE MOST stressful and expensive purchase I have ever made to any company in my life. What seemed like a good deal to have broadband has now cost me a fortune in mobile data whilst I spend 2 months waiting to actually access my own wifi I’m paying for.

Now I have a working box after buying my own cable the signal is HORRENDOUS, constantly drops, I’m losing work because it’s not saving after the signals gone and my TV is constantly buffering when I watch it. I can’t even get a full song when Amazon music is on.

An absolute ridiculous situation and complete joke!"

On 12 Dec upon receiving the parcel and paid extra customs costs, I noticed one copy was missing. I wrote a letter of complaint to you but so far received no answer. In total I spent US$ 66 for 1 calendar and had even to pay extra €16 in order to accept the package!!

Broadband has still not arrived 3 weeks after due date and they never give a reason apart from the same ""not our fault, it's an openreach system issue, another update will be provided in 5 days'

Customer service has been shockingly bad. Overly friendly on the phone but have failed to follow through on 5 different promises to call back/email. Escalated to management this afternoon and got another promise of a callback but NOTHING happened. Also they refuse to confirm that I will still receive the £5 per day compensation if I go to another provider so they're essentially blackmailing me to stay with them."

Delivery date arrived, Van turned up at 3pm, delivery men advised Argos don't do installations of fridge-freezers, nor do they remove old appliances. Can't fault the delivery guys, very pleasant and as bewildered as I was. Customer Service advised of a fault on their website allowing them to add extras on and charge you additional, substantial sums of money for a service they don't even offer. Again, can't fault the CS Agent, no sugar coating it, advised it was a fault straight away and offered to remove delivery or full refund. Took full refund and went elsewhere. Shocking error to be making during a cost of living crisis at Christmas."

Don’t waste time with other misleading higher offers which get the ‘offer’ price knocked down.

After half a year they increased my monthly payments from £50 from £51.50 which was fine not too much of a difference, still annoying that they changed my contract. Once my two years were up I didn’t want to start a new contract but managed to bag a great deal for £48 with carphone, after half a year once again they increased my contract by over £4! Absolutely ridiculous it’s already quite expensive and on top of that I have to pay £2 a day if I am abroad and use mobile net or if I call. Fair to say this is the last phone contract I will have with this company. Tired of these unexpected price increases."

165260,I have just seen your announcement of price increases and am absolutely flabbergasted and appalled at the timing of this decision.

To whomever decided on the timing of this please read the news and have some respect and humanity for the situation people face.

Installation was simple, on time and straight forward.
No issue with the internet.

Cons:
I cancelled my subscription in Jan 2022 and received an email confirming that my subscription would be cancelled on the 1s of Feb 2022. They kept taking payment every month.

Called them up to correct this and to get a refund. They confirmed I would be refunded in a couple of days and sent an email to that effect. It is now June and they have TAKEN PAYMENT EVERY MONTH FOR A CANCELLED SUBSCRIPTION. Just got off the phone again and they still cannot resolve it until they get approval from a manager.

I had the subscription for 6 months and have paid for almost a year. Not worth the hassle!"

Never get anywhere when you phone them,they do they're up most to try and fob you off with excuse after excuse,when you request to speak with a manager apparently there is no one in the building with any authority to authorize a simple request,instead it will take 5 working days. It feels the further on with technology we get the longer us customers have to wait and the more deplorable the services get. I was sold my policy with the promise that if the product was not fixed within the 7 days I would be offered a new one or vouchers to replace it,no where did it say that after the 7 days you could wait 5 or more working days for the write off to be done and then a further 5 or more working days for vouchers or my replacement...

I won't go into anymore detail as having seen the over 14,000 bad reviews here, it is clear to me that this organisation has no customer service and indeed doesn't care about their customers at all.
In over 50 years at a high level in business myself, I can honestly say I have never experienced such indifference by a company to their customers. Truly a disgrace."

I had to pay my bill a second time as you disconnected my service and as a home worker I needed my broadband. I’ve had no response from the missing payment team and when I ring nobody is remotely interested in my issue and I’ve been advised to WRITE a letter if I am not getting a response to my emails!

152906,"I have had an insurance to my TV for over a year with them. Never had any problems, until I had to actually made a claim. I had to call numerous times, because after waiting for 20 to 30 minutes the call would just drop. Also, when I got through the first time, the operator was quite rude saying that he didn't find our details and could not help me at all, even when I had even the original receipt with the proof that I had agreed with a support agreement.
They finally found my details, after I insisted and gave all the numbers possible to prove that I had the support agreement, but then, they said they would send the replacement item within 10 days. The item is yet to arrive, so I called them again today and waited for over 1 hour and did not speak to anyone, so I just gave up. Worst customer service ever. I will never be in business with them again!
*****Update*****
I called again on the 09/11. The guys I spoke to, Lory explained to me that the 10 days was going to be on the 10/11, however, it could take even longer (he was the first operator to ever tell me that). He then went on saying that to make sure that my parcel arrived he was going to order it again. Now, why would he do that?!? To me it seems like there was no order in the first place at all or something else happened to my order. I asked him, but he didn't have a a satisfactory response. Now, two days have passed from the day that it should have arrived and still, nothing. I will return to update you all."

The TV didn't arrive till 2 days after it should of, the delivery information being sent to be was confirming it would be delivered but on a day already been and gone and the customer service was terrible, with staff being rude and unhelpful. If a failed delivery was attempted we never had any notification of it and didn't go out on the day it was scheduled for so we wouldn't miss it. The rude lady on the phone said it was because they had 4 drivers off sick so it hadn't been dispatched yet. This would of been no problem if they had said it would be delayed but I kept getting updated saying it was out for delivery."

I agreed an 18 month contract after they took over the Post Office Homephones account. Price set for 18 months is what I agreed subject to a rise of no more than 3% in April. I couldn't work out my last bill but paid on time. I am then offered the option of agreeing to pay a price increase or leave the contract without penalty! I have never been notified of a price increase and this a 'breach of contract' so I complain and get an email that the complaint is closed without any explanation.

What an absolute disgrace this outfit is. Just by looking through the reviews before listing, you can clearly see they are a bunch of jokers and clowns.
Laptop returned under warranty as keycap came off. Replied back saying they found a spillage inside the unit (although not willing to pass on the evidence, but what this has got to do with a physical malfunction and poor design, I don't know?), and stated this is not covered my the manufactures warranty. However when i went to pick up the laptop, the absolute imbeciles had lost the very thing it went in for in the first place. The keycap... Absolute was of time speaking to anyone in this outfit, and even more frustrating trying to navigate the dead-end phone system.
Will never buy a thing from this company or MSI again, as I'm disgusted and sick to the stomach how they treat people, and disappointed at the quality of there products."

Just re-discovered some Argos eGiftCards in my email inbox history, which I forgotten about. To my surprise, they actually have a shorter expiry date than physical giftcards! Having contacted Argos customer service, to see if they can re-issue since one was only 1 month out-of-date, they said they can't do anything about them.

I felt stupid to have even bothered asking. My own fault for leaving them to expire.

Lesson for all - don't trust Argos to do the right thing for the customer! They're a business and want to keep your money."

So I have 2 exact cards registered and now I have to choose which for future payments. Tut tut tut.
I wonder if this is a way of stealing people's passes and/or getting out of paying cashback. Either way it stinks and I'm far from the only customer it happened to as a quick Google search will confirm. When will the Government give its regulator some teeth .

146942,Worst experience ever. I ordered a iPhone 7 waited the two weeks for the dispatch. I never received any communication. Emailed them about it and they asked me to wait another two weeks. I wanted the phone and had paid so decided to wait. Had to keep emailing them again and again only to get a Reply week later. Keep getting a time frame from them of 1/2 weeks to wait. Apparently Had been put on a urgent list that was with the manager and I was to wait another week. Again never received anything. Emailed again as they have no phone line to call. Asked for a manager to call never did. I was contacted back to say wait another two weeks. Over all this they had my money well over two months!!! They ain’t stupid definitely just happy to long it off to build interest. The reply’s were rude and after I was given the option to refund I took this. They told me I needed to wait another two weeks for the refund. I replied saying was it was unacceptable and they replied ignoring it just that it had been cancelled. I would never use this company again. Take you for a ride. So much stress over something so easy to resolve. Just telling lies every step of the way. Currently waiting two weeks for the refund now. Still stuck without a phone. 2 and a bit months and nothing! Joke

Waited for over 2 weeks for the parts which still never arrived so did get a new machine but was also told i would get a pro-rata fund back of the 3 year policy i paid for in cash. I was due to get £78 to use towards a new plan, which had a 1 year expiry date, as the new washing mach has a 1 year warranty i do not get a new plan until after this expires. which was what i done on my last machine. I have now been told i needed to use this voucher at time of purchase. which would be a waste of a year. So they took my money in cash, gave me a refund to be used on a new policy which i cannot use. so guess what the company is £78 better off as i will loose this money. Their terms and conditions do not state this, a total sham, they are happy to take the cash off you but not give you it back. If you buy one of these policys do not expect to get any of your money back you are due. Like many others here you get no where when you complain. just told thats how it is after being passed from pillar to post. I am currently speaking with trading standards about this as the company must be fleecing thousands back of people who are not using there pro-rata vouchers. Absolute joke!!!!"

191853,"I came here purely in hopes my poor review will help the score reduce further because that really is how bad they are!

Firstly, the broadband is awful, the worst I've ever had. It was forever dropping and I couldn't even stream a single program on my laptop the entire time I was with them.

Secondly, the tv boxes are awful too. Mine barely worked, couldn't get half the kids channels despite having the kids pass, took months to convince them to send a dongle instead.

And lastly, the p*ss poor customer service, or lack there of. Spent weeks and weeks fighting them because they shouldn't be charging for a service they can't provide. Forever getting through to people who couldn't and wouldn't help. Escalated my complaint several times to be told I'd be given a refund as well as free passes, just for them to continue taking money from my account.

In the end the entire contract was a battle. I got the most pathetic refund and then closed my account with them. I couldn't advise people against them enough. The worst provider for TV or broadband I have ever been with, and that's without saying all the terrible things they also did to my neighbour at the same time!

Avoid like the plague, not worth the hassle at all. Looks like a cheap deal but you pay for quality... when the deal is cheap, so is the level of service..."
136020,"Really disappointed with the service. I paid for a Pristine condition phone, however when the phone arrived there were a few scratches and the battery was 84%. With paying extra I was looking for a battery health above 90%. There is also a scratch on the camera lenses which makes the photos look different. Whenever I use the front camera something always appears in the photo which I think it’s the camera lenses on the front camera. I’m hesitant to send it back as from some of the reviews folks don’t get their money back even when they send the device to music magpie. Without all this problems the phone works great"

137300,"I thought I'd best leave a review because of my recent experience. I got a quote for my phone which was 3 months old. I didn't really like it and got a quote from Mazuma which I thought was very good, so I sent the phone in without reading the reviews and went ahead and bought a new phone knowing that I'd be getting the money that Mazuma had said they would give me. I then read the recent reviews of people not getting the price they were quoted and were recieving new quotes of half or even less than the original. Obviously I was concerned. The phone I sent in was genuinely in pristine condition having always had a cover and screen protector fitted. But the reviews I read made me worry that I wouldn't get the right price and I would lose out. A couple of days later I received an email at around 11 in the morning saying that they had got my phone and I would be paid the same day if the phone passed the quality inspections. I heard nothing all day, which I was disappointed about having been promised same day payment if they receive the device before 12. The next morning, which was Saturday, I got another email this time telling me that my phone had passed the QC inspection (relieved) and would be paid asap. Didn't get anything until the following Monday. Which again is disappointing. So instead of getting paid the day they receive d my phone, it actually took 3 and a half days. I am thankful however, that I got the price quoted. But like I mentioned above, my phone was genuinely in like new condition. When selecting the devices condition when getting a quote, don't put excellent condition unless it is like brand new. They obviously will find any excuse not to pay the full amount and try knock you down."
108696,Was offered 200 pounds for my money condition s20+./ sent it away and then was offered 50 pounds saying the screen had failed. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the screen and is in perfect working order. Won't be using these sort of companies again and envirophone is the reason.

169636,I wish i could rate them a zero. Same as everyone else here...been scammed with the trade in. Screen burn on a very well looked after phone. Shoukd have received 185 plus 100 internet promotion. Offered 70. What a rip off
144940,Very competitive and reliable company. Acted on precise instruction for delivery requirements
147890,This providers mobile broadband is useless. I can barely read an email let alone surf the web. I’ve complained multiple times and got nowhere. Obvious bandwidth issues but they aren’t doing anything about it. Anyone that I know that is with them has the same problem. They’ve effectively turned my iPhone into a Nokia 310! Do yourself a favour and give this company a miss.
129397,"Quick service, no fuss, goods in perfect condition."
111218,Ordered Sunday morning around 1.30am; items delivered Monday lunchtime. Unbelievably good service!
168477,I have used Music magpie to sell on our upgrades for many years excellent service. Hassle free - reasonable quote and fast payment.
127818,Excellent help from customer services to raise an issue under the two year guarantee and was immediately sent a replacement part. Delivered the next day.
105987,"My broadband contract has come to an end, the cost has now doubled from £29.99 to £62.25. I just want to get the cheapest option(s) available. I have to be passed to 'customer care' just to get this and have been waiting for an hour. Why can't these be made available to choose from in the account section? Very sneaky and infuriates an otherwise loyal customer."
179519,"Arrived within the 7 working days stated, works perfectly and in a brilliant condition"
142126,"Great service, knowledgeable people on the other end of the phone. Good waiting times if any."
147618,Ordered Saturday turned up spot on time Fantastic service
131703,"rubbish experience . cant update my credit card details NO MATER WHAT I DO, so I cant purchase anything . Can no longer get into my account either and they don't send you a password reset to do so . USELESS!!!!
IT guys need to do a better job, or here's a thought, just DO THEIR JOBS AND FIX THESE 2 GLARING ERRORS instead of eating McDonalds all day!!"
142132,"Great Product!
The noise cancelling on the galaxy buds is dangerously cool. I love it. Some minor scratches here and there but not a problem. Would recommend."
154575,Great product. Fantastic price. Delivery faultless
155581,"I had been with NowTV for many years. Everything worked smoothly until a year or two ago they started to charge all sorts of bolt on, E.g. £5/mth Boost membership just to be able to watch movies that I have already paid for without ads.

The way they promote these add-on services is sneaky. Basically, anyone including children can buy these without having to enter any sort of password. They do offer a payment PIN but it’s never highlight to customers. So my 6 year old “bought” a few, E.g. Boost, entertainment package. As a result, I had been paying for these for 18mths without realising. There is no monthly bill that’s emailed to me, no renewal reminder, just nothing. The whole thing is designed to run quietly.

When I eventually found out, they blame me on not setting up payment PIN, even though I have never received and prompt or emails about setting up this PIN.

Such short-sighted and greedy way to increase their revenue. Needless to say, I will never use NowTV again.

Ps: their movies aren’t that great either."
185975,"Was worried about buying a refurbished phone , I needn’t of , absolutely perfect , phone didn’t have a mark on it , arrived the next day , very happy"
114626,Cheapest battery but not great marketing. Luckily for me I have been told about you but wondering how many more are missing out.
182910,fixed the problem on second visit fast call out especially as it was just after the Christmas holidays
180681,Still waiting for a refund that was promised back in October (after months of chasing). This has still not arrived and I am told the same thing every time I call that the cheque will be with me in two weeks. I questioned the adviser as to why I couldn't be paid by bank transfer as this is what I had been told two weeks prior and she hung up the phone on me.
189940,"The best mobile phone company!!!
I would definitely buy from here again-highly exceeded my expectations👍"
140930,"Phoned through all sorted so quickly, sad to say they was not so helpful in the shop"
187038,Absolutely gutted I had to go into an Iva as by kept me connected with family due to mental health I couldn’t pay my bill which is why I’m guessing I had a difficult time trying to communicate with staying connected maybe this could be recognised for future as people do recover and try to pay back over due debt like myself

115020,"I would of given 5 stars if the workers could of got ahold of a very late responding seller but after two to three hours or more I got the items, I do however dislike the 48 money back guarantee it should be 24 hours since some items are on a 15 min guarantee"
151739,I was 5 minutes late to meet the rider who supposedly left the order at my doorstep. My order clearly was not there . Top that with extremely unhelpful customer support who can’t even contact the driver let alone refund. Such a shame not to receive the order you payed for especially during a living crisis. What an unethical company. Never using again.
138364,"After many fruitless emails regarding my faulty IHD unit, Jennifer (Customer Resolution Advisor) was able to secure 2 new meters and a new IHD unit for me. She arranged the engineer and time with everything going smoothly.
She was in contact with me throughout to ensure my satisfaction."
185279,"Using my Hermes to send out parcels and it never arrived, using covid as an excuse to not have anyone to speak to in customer services isn’t so good either

Next time I ll just buy from a shop instead"
132102,"When ordering a cooker from AO, remember that some do not come with pipes and AO don't know this, because the items are pre-packed by the supplier. They are just the middle men. If you find any order without the parts, they will accept return."
137859,"Moving Shell energy to my new home was a struggle after being with your company for 7 years. I informed you for days before moving. When both electricity and gas were cut off by the former supplier, I call you and the engineer came to restore the electricity but won't do the gas because the staff did not give the instruction to do both.

My family was in the cold for 4 nights after spending over 8 hours on phone but your staff kept transferring me from one desk to another only to repeat myself. In fact, your emergency line cut the phone on me though it was your staff that asked me to call the line. It was a terrible experience.

Your communication flow is not synchronized at all. The knowledge base of some staff is shallow.
Your turnaround time is poor. I am shocked Shell can be this poor with families that have children being left in the cold during winter.

Anyway, thank Mariam Ajenifuja who finally helped last Friday to restore the gas. i am really grateful to her for taking her time and being detailed. Within a few hours, the gas was restored.

I deserve compensation and I have sent in a complaint. Again waiting for ages to get a response."
184736,"I’m am so happy! Really quick really easy! I had to phone Mazuma just to ask a few questions I was put through straight away and all questions asked! Sent my phone if within 1 day my money was in my account!

140451,I have recently got a new contract with three and I must say the customer service I received from Tehzib Khan was second to none. She was amazing to speak to and solved all my queries and got me the best contract possible according to my preferences. Couldn’t have asked for better customer service from Tehzib.

146163,"Ordered a phone for next day delivery last week. DPD have lost the parcel so this hasn’t arrived.

I have requested to cancel my order so I can get a phone elsewhere and it has now been 10 days since I was told it was going to be resolved. I was first told it would be sorted the following day, then 48 hours, and now it’s 18 working days. The time frame just keeps getting longer and longer. I no longer need the device. I have asked numerous times to cancel my order but they are refusing to do so.

I keep being promised call backs but I have called 5/6 times, and emailed in but nobody has actually done anything to help. I just keep being told it’s being looked into. Your companies issue is with DPD losing your product. Not myself. I am now caught in the middle and being messed around. Your customer service is atrocious."
119481,"Good advice in store to help choose right TV as so confusing with all the different types and sizes. The TV itself delivered promptly and on time. Very pleased with quality and chosen size.
Even better was the price match promise as saving passed on when price reduced online in week after purchase and the price difference refunded."
125403,Hi I was called 3 times for last 3 dsys spoke with more then 10 people and I was feel ignoring. Today I spoke with Marvil and he was so helpful try sort out the problem No just past for somebody alse. Great job I wish to Shell have more workers like him.

Tomorrow morning i will finish with them, is enough ! So DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM specially brodband !"
160162,The quality of the phones I got sent exceeeded my expectations and was very good for the price. Fast delivery and good communications.
114633,The website was easy to use and I found what I needed without a problem. I was kept informed regarding delivery and it arrived quickly. The RAM were in sealed anti static bags and fitted easily. So far they are performing very well.
120927,I have raised a complaint with Team Knowhow. Every time they respond it’s someone new. They have failed to respond to any of the issues I have raised and have now stopped corresponding with me altogether. I am appalled by their none existent customer service and lack of respect they show to customers.
185987,"Excellent service, especially the delivery turnaround."
178208,"Spoke with Sanela A and she was fantastic. Very friendly and helpful. Helped me with my enquiry. I do not think Shell are a great company by any means, but every time I have contacted the staff have been brilliant (on live chat) and on this occasion Sanela A was knowledgeable and a credit to customer service"

I’m a Sky customer and Sky can’t even get in touch with an engineer to arrange another appointment.
111737,"The whole process from start to finish including the delivery, the price was great saved from buying a new cooker, great service I recommend buying from this company well done."
173535,"Nice and easy purchase experience. However, it would be useful to have the grade descriptions soemwhere on the item page. I had to look elsewhere on the site to find what the letters mean (unless I missed it)."
121021,"Shocking service and company, scamming buyers so beware. Offered guaranteed minimum trade in of £150 when buying the 21FE, returned old phone and received £8. Phoned customer service and emailed all the relevant options. Contacted on Twitter and messenger like the replies to previous complains suggested and none of them can help. All clueless, time wasters. Using lucrative offers to not fulfil them, should be shut down"
148468,Good product but shocking service when relying on royal mail.
193328,"Hi am sorry to say since you upgraded our internet and router the service has been terrible service keeps dropping out and freezing.

signal problem in my area was told to be solved in 2weeks but persisted for months.

gaveup"
126778,"Very good powerful sound. First time I have had a soundbar so nothing to really compare against but way better than the TV’s own sound. Very easy to set up, especially the built in Chromecast which makes it very easy to set up streaming and no need to turn the tv on if you only want to listen to music. Only reason I have not given 5 stars is that the packaging was a disgrace. The unit thankfully was undamaged."
155801,"Problem with Digital Voice / Open Reach / Halo solved swiftly - my landline phones are now working. I thoroughly recommend BT Facebook Messenger as a means of communicating instantly with a human being, rather than with a machine. Your service is invaluable and I'll be recommending it."
161799,"Bought an iPhone 12 Pro in “good” nearly cost me £500 come looking like someone just smashed it off a wall, terrible condition, the screen has damage, the sides are damaged, and the worst thing about it the phone hasn’t been cleaned 🤮 it has all the last persons germs/ dirt on it. The box you guys youse to send £500 items is pathetic.

After speaking to a customer service advisor named Ben, he just kept telling me to send the phone back, whoever this a Christmas gift, and I’ve paid a lot more to get the phone with music magpie as the condition and warranty sounded good. I’ve been conned though, go buy a second hand device from gumtree for half the price, worst service I’ve ever had"
168484,Terrible service you don’t get a receipt of purchase when ordered takes weeks to answer emails and as for returns they don’t refund you unless you call them a (48 minute wait for someone to answer) that’s if they do!! Recorded delivery for return arrived 13/12/21 refund 5/1/22 only because I called!!! Don’t bother……
124502,Ordered a new Laowa macro lens but on receipt the lens had a problem and would not communicate with my camera. So why the 5 star? Well 1) I'd seen the lens elsewhere for less money but Wex did their best to help me on the price so that issue went away. And 2) on phoning them with the lens problem they had no hesitation at all in arranging a prepaid return label and refund for me. I will always say judge a company not on their sales but on how they handle a problem and WEX were exemplary here so a deserved 5 stars.
154591,"Original part, easy ordering, constant progress updates. And, using Royal mail they called me to pick up from our reception rather than leaving in the reception area like other delivery firms!"
188364,"BT only care about taking your money. They are a bunch of cowboys. I’ve literally had enough of them. Been a bt business customer with them for nearly 20 years and every few years they cold call me to say we can get you a better deal. I accept their “better deal” thinking that they are on my side and trying to help me out but what they don’t tell you is they don’t just renew your contract they add the new deal on to what you already have. I’ve just found out that I’ve been paying for 2 phone lines, 2 broadbands and their recommended “cloud” phone costing over £200 a month when all I ever needed was broadband and a phone line in my office. I Only recently twigged why my bills are so high and been on the phone with them for over 5hrs this week trying to sort the account out to no avail. total contempt for me as a long standing customer. They remind me of that company called ENRON"

141289,"All the staff were gathered together in a huddle. They were not have a staff meeting but all on their phones. I had to go over and ask for help as no one had approached me. A guy came over and asked what I wanted. I showed him what I wanted to buy and he got it out the cupboard and took me to the till, scanned the item and said that the card machine was ready. He then sat down.and carried on doing whatever it was in his phone looking a the Internet. The card machine took my payment and he gave me a receipt, still looking at his phone. The customer service I received was zero. Disgusting service. I won't be going back to the Sittingbourne store again. Also there was a set up so you could listen to the different type of WiFi speakers but none of them worked. When I queried this I was told to go to another store where their demo system might work. Disgraceful service allbround. I got the impression none if the staff wanted to be there."

143687,"Do NOT switch to or contract with BT for Broadband and TV!
We agreed the deal 3 months before our Sky Contract finished and thought that would be long enough for BT to get themselves sorted in time - apparently not!
They failed to deliver the equipment in time for contract start, the alleged Technical 'Expert' failed to show on the agreed date and when he did appear he rushed in and said he had 30 minutes to do the install and show us everything. He was so rushed he didn't do the job properly, the system didn't work properly and we were completely confused!
Rang the Complaint Team next day who were actually helpful and they booked another 'Expert' for a 2 hour slot 5 days later and promised it would all be sorted.
5 days later, the same 'Expert' arrived (45mins late) and the first thing he said was 'I've only got 30 mins'. Enough! Told him not to bother and that we were cancelling the contract. He suddenly tried to become helpful but it was too late, we'd had enough.
We rang Sky straightaway and they were very helpful, gave us a great deal to rejoin and as we still had the equipment reconnected us immediately
BT were utterly useless and took every opportunity to let us down and mess it up.
Do NOT contract with or switch to BT."

159304,"Battery and price great, only let down by courier (Yodel) who unfailingly deliver to the postcode showing on their SatNav, not to our address. Left me without a car for an extra 48hrs while they sorted a redelivery, despite a really quick dispatch by Tayna. Would have been better if there was a ""leave in a safe place"" rather than having to have someone sign for it; this nonsense would make me hesitate from using Tayna again."

I received an Order Acknowledgement advising Next Day Delivery.
However, the following day, my order didn't arrive and I asked FFX for an explanation.
I was politely informed they could not complete my Order as they had run out of stock of the SOCKS!!
Unbelievable!!
I'm sure my customers would not be happy if I told them I could not complete the work as I had no socks!!
Never again FFX."
199812,"they are helpful, knowledgeable, not pushy and not condescending to people who don't know what they need. I think their prices are reasonable."

158506,"Had a washing machine delivered with a big crack in it. Trying to get the return sorted has been a nightmare. I ring knowhow and they put me through to LG (the brand of washing machine). I speak to LG and they want me to speak to Knowhow. They both insist i have to talk to the other party. Absolute mess of a system and seriously long hold times. Everyone i seem to speak to puts me through to someone else.

How is this such a mess for such a big company?? Surely sorting out a damaged product should be fairly straight forwards for them!

I cant fill in their return form online as it asks you to ring in if the item is damaged.

Sort out your processes knowhow!


Update:
Continually asked by knowhow for an uplift number, from LG. Which LG stated they could not give me. They said it was clearly a knowhow problem. They said if in the instance an uplift number was needed the company should be asking for it not me. Knowhow continued to refuse to talk to LG.

What a joke! You need to work on your partnership with LG, as your lack of process is causing the customer to suffer.

It is not my job to tell LG they are wrong."
117446,As ever with wex great service and attention to the customer. There are other (closer) places I could go but the great service they provide makes that pointless.
143250,"Friendly helpful expert advice, genuine enthusiasm for products and in helping customers"
131037,"Good quality laptop. Bought for partner to do university work on. Slim, lightweight and very good quality.
However disappointed with the length of time the item was in production. After 20 working days in pre-production in phoned for an update, and was told straight away ""it'll be in production tomorrow with a delivery scheduled for end of the week"". This was not the case. Rang back the following week for the same response. After emailing for a written response I was told that parts were out of stock. Eventually received may order just over a month after ordering.
3rd laptop purchased from PC Specialist, probably not the last either. I just wish they had better communication. If parts are out of stock, at at least inform the customer. I would have been happy to wait, if I knew. But for no communication and to be told un-truths is poor."
177275,Always a good choice quick delivery phones are always better than discribed very happy

169555,"TERRIBLE COMPANY , worse than virgin media, I waited a month for the internet connection and after a month they told me that the box is not mounted on the wall outside of my building and I have to wait a few more months, communist company, consider signing a contract with BT."

Now have to wait 7 days for a refund of my money, before I can then go and buy another phone, elsewhere. Helpful when my current phone doesn’t work"

about to finalize my order I ask him a few questions via the Chat, and he tells me stock unavailable, in reality he just updated the prices from 33.7 euro to more than 50 euro for the same order."
124503,Reliable and efficient service.
181912,"Ordering was easy. Information on delivery was helpful and delivery guys were very pleasant and polite.
My only negative would be that on your web site the picture of the person for the chat line was very intrusive. It obliterated a lot of relevant information and I could not find a way to get rid of it. It was annoying to the point where I gave up and ordered my dishwasher from another company. As it happens they were out of stock so I returned to you but I suggest you either reposition the picture or even better, make it so customers can delete it.
Other than that the whole transaction was flawless and I would definitely buy from you again and recommend you."

195222,So they lost my package so had to wait to another one to arrive. Then I went to collect it what I couldn’t because their system showed I already took that package. The manager checked that for me and turned out they started the process of refund. So had to pay again for the same item. Of course I still didn’t get my refund yet.
152713,"Ordered food at 7 pm and waited for an hour then a message popped up that food was delivered on time without delivery. We've contacted them through live chat and the only solution they could offer was a refund. By this time, it was already 8.30 pm and we only needed food, not a refund. The customer service assistant and the manager repeated the same excuse 100 times but had no desired to sort out the issue. Do not waste your time and use other options for delivery. This review took an extra few min of my precious time. Not happy at all."
192117,The company is very nice and helpful my experience here is nice they been looking out and helping me
146158,"I have been a very customer for a few years now. I've always been happy with the service
Today I have been trying to contact someone at very large items dept.
(they asked me to call) I have had a TV for 11 months and it has decided to give up. Engineer came out 2 weeks ago. It need a replacement part costing £700 but this was rejected so Very have asked me to ring them
Manufacturers fauIt. I waited 40 mins on the phone. They hung up. I tried ringing customer services. Amanda told me she would put me through directly but guess what the same queue as before waited 50 mins , they hung up. Customers services again who said they will phone back
So if you have any issues customer service is appalling.
I would never buy anything again from Very due to this reason. It's a shame as delivery has been great, but you need good customer service otherwise there is just no point. I dont usually write reviews but felt I had to."
164841,"We’re fast, helpful, polite so well mannered and made sure I was happy with everything bfore they left no nonsense in and out in no time and very happy with my new working washing machine can’t fault them"
121538,"Honestly, the worst provider you can possibly get in the UK. AVOID AT ALL COST!! I AM TELLING YOU FOR YOUR OWN WELL-BEING THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO SCAM YOU.

My phone was stolen on the 17th July - I have been waiting for 2 weeks and I still have not received a working SIM despite going to three different stores in London (Stratford, Covent Garden and Liverpool Street) and spoke to their support team (entirely outsourced in India with not great english) which told me 3 times to wait 24h as ""there is no chance it will not get resolved"".

Two weeks later i still do not have my phone number!

I cannot work as this is my phone number and my life has been incredibly impacted by the lack of phone. I cannot get a new simcard with the same number and i also cannot change my number. My only solution is to get a pay as you go sim which I will get from a different provider!"
106852,"I ordered an item that said ""In store, collect today"". Great, I wanted it today and i'm off work so I ordered it. Order comes through: stock will be delivered to store on 25th (2 days from today). What? It said it was in Store collect today? Check website again, still says in stock in store collect today. So I contact the web chat person, webchat person (Yashika) lies to me, tells me it's in stock collect today. Ask her why does my email then say Wednesday 25? She says my payment has to be verified and cleared. I'm using a currys voucher for the entire amount.

Absolute kafkaesque shop that I will not go back to ever again now. Nothing ever in stock, webchat people lie to you. Website says in store and available, but for some reason my order will be delivered to the store 2 days from now? Absolute disgrace."
125980,"A useful company that I have bought items from for years – they are very affordable and the delivery is good. They could improve by selling more vinyl records, particularly used vinyl for under £10. Also their returns policy needs more clarity regarding the QR code service, which is still unfamiliar to many people."
109935,I was really worried as I submitted my meter reading incorrectly and all my credit was used. They fixed the issue and made me feel reassured it will be okay.
168174,Despicable service. Truly shocked. Covid 19 Is no excuse for a 4 hour wait on the phone. NOONE should order from Currys at the moment as they obviously cant handle it at. Use AO.com for any white goods. Much better service.
100073,The guys were very friendly Ian kep me up to date all the way till he got to my daughters door once the got there they were very helpful took the washing machine straight into my daughters kitchen he gave her all the instructions what to do with it once she got it out the packing then when he lef hers he called me to let me know it was safely delivered as it was me whose name is on receipt as o purchased it he then gave instructions on what to do when it came out packing so that was so good of him that’s why I’ve given 5 stars
193575,"AVOID AVOID AVOID.

I have never been able to access my mobile data from the beginning of my contract and now they won’t let me leave as they will charge me a fee"
194482,"Excellent customer service. Had a few issues activating some plugins and they were very helpful, got back in no time, really pleased!"
192570,My multiple order came in one package promptly. Was easier than buying from Amazon
176361,Overall experience excellent as always. Would be good if there was an option to change the size of the calendar after adding all the photos. It was my fault for choosing the wrong size to begin with but would have been quite onerous to start again from the beginning.
199926,"I had my appliance delivered and it was faulty, I telephoned Very and they delivered a replacement the next day and because the original item was not in stock and they sent a more expensive one they only charged the original item price. Very helpful. Top marks"
175063,"I started back in the summer to get fibre 900 installed but as usual B.T cocked this up. First the adviser said I didn't need to be in when the engineer came but low and behold he needed access to my house to install a box. I complained to a team leader then they arranged another visit to which open reach moved the date without informing me. So rearranged it again and the they just didn't turn up. So that was the last straw and I cancelled the order. So black Friday deals come and thought I would try again ( big mistake). First the engineer was spot on and fitted everything but I received a fault after he left. I phoned B.T technical team and they said that I was getting switched on later that day but i informed them that I had the internet working but it was a fault, he told me its fine and that it would be fine when i get switched on so i waited a few hours and yes you guessed it the fault was still there. They could of get the engineer back but the advisor thought he knew more than me. I spoke to someone who was on the technical team and they confirmed what I told them. So another engineer was booked in for the following day 1300hrs to 1800hrs. THE OPEN REACH LAZY IDIOT DIDNT EVEN SHOW UP. So B.T are absolutely useless and should be fined for treating customers like this. VOLO13-642392605778 TO PROVE THAT ITS ONGOING. SORT YOUR COMPANY OUT, DON'T EVER GO WITH B.T

REPLY TO B. T stop giving the standard response rubbish because if actually read the review, you would notice its ongoing. Stop giving customers the BS"
148724,Incredibly quick delivery; ordered the fridge at around 4.30 pm and it was delivered the following morning before 11am. They kept me notified of the exact time of delivery and the guys who delivered it were polite and friendly. Have no reservations about recommending them.
157476,"Horrible company, poor quality items, customer service terrible. Keen to take your money but service horrific! Stay away, would never use again!"
132073,Easy instructions to follow on site & very efficient service. Quick delivery & good quality product
183125,"First attempt at buying both a smart phone and a second hand one. Easy to explore web site. Very easy to order and fantastically fast delivery. Quality of phone outstanding - far better than I expected.
My adult children recommended your site as they all use it.
Thanks."
133123,"All fine, delivery and product and generally all good . And merry xmas 😉🎄"
141236,"Great service and lovely presentation
Fantastic item"
190543,Correct item. Vey quick delivery
130366,"Overall very pleased with the seamless changeover. Switched from TalkTalk who put their prices up to £40 a month, whereas Now TV was £20. Any differences? Talk talk's router had more power and reached the car with ease. Now TV does it with one bar showing. Overall very happy,but just using broadband and free calls. Linking SKy Q to the router needed help from Sky, as Talk Talk had to be deleted first to load NowTV which is the same as a sky router anyway and selected that option during Sky set-up?!
Uodate - 67mbs in average and very reliable so far."
108568,"No respect for their long time customers. Making you pay for a contract and not offering any standards on the coverage and service. The amount of stress I got from dealing with them is inamiginabile, so frustrating. I will take this further and make sure they will learn a lesson. Shame on the company and staff."
140339,"I've left bt so they have decided that they will fine me if I don't send back the router I paid for.

They claim its about helping the planet but conveniently they make a profit by fining people for not sending it back.

How is this OK?"
153498,There was a problem with delivery. After contacting customer service the issue was quickly resolved.
181575,App is super easy to use and self explanatory! Super easy way to get involved on the platform!
132931,So easy to do and the process was simple. When they received my phone and checks completed I received payment very promptly.
152692,Fast delivery of the correct parts. Well packed and protected.
130424,"Foolishly I thought I'd give HMV a chance by ordering an expensive box set. Sadly, it is days late after its release date and HMV are quite happy to blame the Royal Mail. Aren't there other couriers out there? When I complained to HMV I was told to just wait... And when I decided to start a return for the item, I was informed there was a £4 charge. No wonder other internet sellers do so well. HMV is a retailer from a bygone age."
141078,"Very competitive price, free postage and next day delivery. What more could you want."
146444,Thanks for returning my payment although it was very painful your returns procedure as I had to go via the back door but eventually I got my refund thank you
139459,Has not gone out for delivery yet. When will it be out for delivery?
152231,"Ordered an iPhone 20th March, nothing dispatched after 2 weeks, so asked to to cancel and get a refund. Still waiting for the refund. 1 month in, no phone and no refund. Don’t buy from these people, seems they are happy to take your money but not deliver or refund.

Update as of 29th April, actually got the refund to my card today after many emails"
174968,Would give a minus five if it was an option. Poorly designed app with ads on paid membership. Takes ages to switch from one device to another. And the cancellation process - very misleading language that purposefully tries to trick you into thinking you've cancelled. I feel cheated and manipulated when I got charged after the cancellation failed. Helpdesk useless. Terrible customer service. Poor choice of content.
129637,"So easy, excellent communication, fast delivery for great items. I have used appliances direct three times now , I have no reason to go anywhere else for electrical items."
173295,"Three months in and I’m still waiting on my refund. This is a criminal enterprise .

I cancelled my order 1 minute after making it (after being informed for the first time that my order wouldn’t be processed for 14 days) and now 4 months on and I’m still waiting for my refund. A refund which your policy says I am guaranteed to receive in 14 days. I’ve been fobbed off numerous times and now can’t even get a reply via email. How about instead of trying to get my review removed you just pay me the money you owe me ? Surely it’s easier ?"
143528,"Fast hassle free. Mean what they say and say what they mean. Would definitely recommend and will use them in the future.

197650,Superb service delivered in great time well recommend.
121648,"Fantastic customer service!
A part was replaced under warranty, no quibbles, delivered next day. Excellent service."
131113,"Absolutely shocking p**** takers. Accepted for credit nearly a year ago. Placed my first order a few days ago, guess what? It got cancelled due to “further checks” I’m fuming as I called customer service and got the middle finger. Terrible, WILL NEVER BUY FROM YOU AGAIN."
183383,"Very good service.
Informed all the way through the process and delivery spot on time.
Well done 👍"
186661,Excellent service received from Phoebe at Marks Electrical regarding a query I had in relation to date of purchase of my oven. She responded straight away which means I can contact the manufacturer to enable my oven to be repaired under warranty. Great service!
114470,"Terrible awful service.

Cannot connect properly. I took a very important only exam but due to Vodafone it cancelled which costed me £279. Terrible internet connection. I tried to report this and waited half an hour on the phone. Tried to contact through online chat but 22 in the queue. Unbelievable. They took a lot of money but no service"
155653,"Phoned York branch of Richer Sounds and made initial inquiry, which was enthusiastically dealt with by Tom. 1 Hour later, having received a personalised confirmation email, I'm in the shop, the equipment is all set up and I'm well impressed. Brilliant service and highly recommended - will use RS, York again!"
122310,"Great deal on brand name. Excellent communication concerning super quick delivery & brilliant, friendly delivery drivers. 100% great."
120286,Excellent service. Great price and a fast efficient delivery service too. Would definitely recommend and will use again.
158828,"My television parcel, which was supposed to arrive on January 17, never arrived. I've been waiting since the morning and rescheduled my plans just so my product would arrive, but it didn't arrive today when it was supposed to. I'm curious how you plan to compensate for this situation."
189852,Had to telephone to complain that there was no communication. After that communication was constant.
136870,"After placing a order 12 days later I still haven't recieved my order. 13 phone calls later I have made the decision to cancel the contract, if they cant deliver a phone that's been ordered with a upfront cost they are never going to be able to deal with a faulty handset or any raising issues! Dont waste your time or effort in this company. Staff told me on a daily basis the phone will be delivered within the next 24 hours and it has never arrived!"
168238,If I could give zero stars I would. Now TV is almost never in HD. My Macbook and Wifi connection has never been an issue with other applications such as youtube and netflix streaming however Now TV always seems to buffer and I’m continuously having to reload my shows about 6 times per episode (no exaggeration if anything it’s more times than this). Do not waste your money I wish I’d listened to the reviews.
107949,"Arrived in good time, pleased with product."
107540,"Ordered online, delivery was very quick and easy. Will be ordering again"
121211,"I booked a new BT Broadband installation,
Install date 01/12/2021 The engineer turns up but BT can’t get the Router delivered to coincide with the Engineer.
I’ve taken a day off work without pay and now being told that I’m not having my Broadband till tomorrow.
It’s clear BT haven’t got a clue what there doing and they don’t understand how much they inconvenience there customers.
Wish I’d never have bothered with BT
There all promises but can’t honour a booking that was made 2 months ago .
There not worth the hassle
Best advice use a more reputable company
Save yourself the stress"
100456,"I have had 2 failed deliveries and I still do NOT have my washing machine!! Unbelievably I was told I have to wait another 7 Days for my 3rd delivery attempt!! The 1st attempt they said we cannot get it past your ground level cupboard in your kitchen as I was told Not enough room to get past the cupboard!! I told them to try as the cupboard is loose and can be moved and manipulated.All 3 of us could have lifted it over as another option.But No they wouldn’t try.It was a Saturday and both of them couldn’t leave quickly enough. I removed the cupboard entirely for the 2nd attempt. This 2nd time 2 men who were a lovely Aberdonian older man and 1 Eastern European man who was very rude and arrogant.They wanted to use the 8 year old Indesit hose already there instead of the brand new Samsung hose with my new £500 washing machine.I told them No and Rude man B questioned my stupidness asking why and telling me, it’s clean water that goes through it and told me it’s a waste of time. I said I adon’t want an 8 year old hose full off slime and not the hose meant for my Samsung machine.Nice nan A changed it politely.However they had already switched the machine on and had water already inside the machine.This caused the machine to stop working and stop taking in water.They had messed up the machine and spent 30mins trying to fix it to no avail.Rude man B was muttering and sighing.So failed attempt 2.Put down as a faulty machine.Why they cut corners I don’t know but in my opinion it’s the reason the machine stopped working.The rude man needs a change of attitude he truly was disgusting and rude.I Now have to wait a week for delivery attempt 3.I don’t have high expectations.Truly awful service.The worst ever.Repulsive rude behaviour by 1 man.I have to wait a full week with no washing machine for attempt number 3. I should be treated better and not be waiting weeks and weeks for total incompetence.Chris."
151173,Equally priced to leading retailer and free next day delivery making them better in my book! I was also able to use blue light discount to make it even cheaper. Kept me up to date with dispatch and my delivery. Will use again. Thanks.
114539,"Great service, it was simple to do and the money was in my bank straight away. Will defo use again in the future."
104784,"Unfortunately really bad service. I was missold a entertainment package. It has taken over 5 weeks and i am still no closer to resolution and been told i would recieve managers call backs 4 times yet i am still waiting. My inital complaint was raised 2 months ago. Very disappointing...

Update kath i have contacted virgin media through all the means below and still no update. I have been promised multiple call backs and emails again very poor service. I shall now be taking this to the ombudsman."
129962,"On website it said there was a hair brush free. Which I was expecting. I tried calling your customer care line which got disconnected after waiting one hour to get through.
It’s like getting robbed in day light.
I would expect the hair brush as well which was on the offer when buying ghd."
111190,"Don’t buy from this company takes over a month for your order to arrive broken, sent it back and they send me someone else’s mobile phone broken."

Good communication
And helpful friendly delivery guys"
129257,"As normal Wex come through, very high quality service as per normal.
If you want it, true you may be able to find it cheaper elsewhere.
But do you really want to do the legwork?"
130242,Everything went very well and the engineer did an excellent job.
182386,"Paid for delivery men to unpack and take away packaging had to do this myself, cable at the back of fridge/freezer very short had to fit to extension to plug into wall, also just noticed a small dent on left hand side very disappointed"
104257,"It’s hard to break down how absolutely shocking Vodafone has been in the last 5 days but I’ll give it a try.

At the weekend I tried to upgrade my phone online but it came up with an error page and told me to call them. Obviously as it was after 8pm I couldn’t get hold of anyone except their useless chatbot.

I tried again the following day and the same error page came up so I called them and they explained they could do nothing as they can’t process trade in upgrades online (I learned today this is bullsh*t I just wasn’t on the phone to the right team). Anyway I now waited 3 days to make sure that I wasn’t going to be charged twice for the upgrades that hadn’t gone through.

Today I decided I would go into store in Hammersmith, and it’s worth noting here it took them an hour and a half to process my upgrade. I was told I would be able to get my new iPhone 13 for free and then a £28 airtime contract. No one read out the terms and conditions or broke down my contract agreement to me, I just signed on the track pad twice and after wasting most of my afternoon, left the store. On my way home I checked and they had put through a device plan of £30 a month additionally which was never mentioned to me in store at all, as I said I was told I would get the phone for free.

After spending a good time on hold to customer services listening to Adele, my only option was to cancel the contract they had put through which is great because now I have to wait 7 days to get £140 back. Bare in mind there is no point me trying to use the money once I get it back to upgrade online, as we have already established this came up twice with an error page.

When my contract ends with Vodafone in December, I will be leaving after 11 years and buying a new phone up front with a sim only deal.

The only thing I want back right now is £140 and the three hours of my time I wasted today but unfortunately I can have neither of those things as Vodafone has lived up to its 1.3 star TrustPilot review of being the UK’s worst telecom provider.

Edit: it’s now been two weeks and still no refund. Couldn’t have been a worse experience."
191149,"Joke of a company, over charged for every aspect of the package. Bt tv doesnt work as soon as it starts raining, even worse its 50/50 when overcast. The internet package renewed automatically every year while putting the price up for £20 pm to over £40 pm in the space of 3 years. Then when we changed provider they charged us £200 for leaving early. I would only recommend to use them for champions league football but better off getting nowtv for that. Only giving 1 star as 0 starts wasnt available."
173461,Awful experience with this company. Purchased a pixel 7 pro on 17th October with a guaranteed trade in of £150 for my old phone. Never recieved the trade in pouch. Despite numerous call to their south African call centre (who couldn't care less or have no idea what I am talking about) I have been unable to trade in my phone. No one replies to emails either. Avoid at all costs
190039,"very poor service . wrote to them twice about the phone having a fault and have had no reply . i am now returning the phone for a full refund . this company can't be trusted . please do not buy anything from these .

Appreciate that this was two months after delivery but thought that as it was mint, no refund just exchange required this would have been possible. No chance, didn't want to know."

135108,"This is the WORST phone company to purchase a phone. Firstly, I ordered an iphone xs max in May 2020 didnt get it till end of June and apparently it was too late for a refund... Eventually I got the phone which seemed to be in good condition although it did have a smell which I guess is from glue. Fast forward it hasn't yet even been over 6 months yet and the Battery is always dying after an hour of using it and there are now screen lines showing on the screen!!!!
I would not advise anyone to purchase a phone at Quick Mobile Fix! Never again!"
166700,Very unhelpful. The driver did not deliver the items and Deliveroo refused to refund and steal money from customers.

Customer had to rely on Warden and other residents to unwrap purchase, which turned out to be the wrong unit, not as displayed on their website, then charged the customer £69 to take it back as they didn’t have a suitable item in stock to exchange. Very disappointed."
149103,Excellent and fast service! Fantastic!

153963,Having to wait on you getting the printer and then your delivery company messing me about lost you 1 star
182280,Delivered carefully and dead on time. Old appliance removed without fuss by two considerate delivery men.
194713,As with the industry there was a delay due to the world shortage of components.PCS’s queuing system was great and provided fantastic communication on the progress. When all components were available the build and testing were completed without any delay and I received the pc fully working and well built. All information and residual components were supplied and I am completely happy with my purchase.
198587,"Absolutely sick and tired with Three. I have had enough.
Two year contract started 2019 finished 2021. Contract was £23.48 a month.
Stopped paying direct debit this year. April’s bill was £23.48 sent to a debt collector. Paid £23.48. May 2022 was increased to over £28. Paid again. June this was increased to over £32. Again paid. This was increased to £39.95 in July. Completely annoyed with Three at this time what to get rid of this contract they have me on as I am now not paying the contract set. And send it to another debt collector. I HAVE PAID THE BILL. Trying to cancel the contract since June and still no joy. Me and customer services don’t mix. And Three is not the only one
WHAT’S THE BILL GOING TO BE NEXT TIME OVER £40s
Come on Three stop robbing me and pull your fingers out!!!!

Minus 5 now because of what you have done and write this politely after paying off the debt collector. Don’t just suspend my account CANCEL IT"
144670,Good value and quality.would have scored higher but for the wex sticker on the tripod leg that is resisting all attempts to remove it...very annoying!!!
189352,"I was going to build my own PC however, I decided to get one custom build because of the outrageous GPU prices at the moment. I did a considerable amount of research on where to buy a custom PC from and found that PC specialist were the best by far.

Their configurator was so easy to use and understand. It had so many options available. I do have some knowledge about computers but as this is my first PC build I wanted to get some more opinions. The PCS forums are full of PC enthusiasts and experts that were able to give me extremely helpful suggestions on how to make the best PC for your budget, use case and display choice.

PCS customer service is also impeccable. They replied to my emails within a couple of hours and were so helpful with any questions that I had. The thing that I loved the most about ordering from PC specialist was that I was given constant updates on the status of my PC.

They informed me when my PC was being processed, built, tested, dispatched and out for delivery. They even let me know that my PC was going to be delayed due to increased demand. Overall, the process was so easy and smooth. I would recommend PC Specialist 100%.

I’ve had my PC for a week now and I couldn’t be more happy with it. I don’t have a bad word to say about PCS. Absolute wonderful company to order from."
168882,"I brought a custom laptop from PC Specialist for my daughter who is at uni, as her laptop was begin to show signs of failing. The order number is 2304780 and the total order price is £2,655.00. After receiving notification that the laptop was completed ahead of schedule, I asked if I could pay the extra for weekend delivery and have it shipped straight away. This was the first time I had phone PC Specialist customer support, and the impression I got was very bad. I was told that customer service department had no access to the delivery department and could not even send an email to that department to ask if my request was possible. I waited the extra 4 days for the laptop to arrive. When it did I arrive, I was shocked to hear from my daughter that PC Specialist had installed windows 11 professional. I had specifically stated that I wanted windows 10. I am an IT professional, and I know that the early versions of Microsoft operating systems are for Beta test dummies. I had advised my own company not to install. I phoned customer support, who were initially very accommodating, and told me that they would send a USB to my daughter with a boot-able installation of windows 10, and they would confirm their actions with an email later that day. I did not receive an email, and my daughter did not receive the usb drive. When I phone to find out what had happened, I was simply told that customer service had asked the company, and no USB could be sent. I explained my position on the operating systems, that it was their mistake not mine to install windows 11, and that I had spent £2,655.00 with their company. I explained the distance selling laws which provide the customer with a no quibble right to return any goods within 14 days and told them that If this was not resolved, that I would use this option. I asked to speak to a manager, or a supervisor and I was told that this was not possible, with the only option being that I would receive a callback form a manager within 24 hours. I asked for the customer service representatives name and or staff number. He gave me a fake name. I tried to call customer support a number of times. The first time I was on hold, the automated system kept telling me that my call was important and that I had 4 minutes left to wait for over 20 minutes and I eventually gave up. The second time I waited over 30 minutes and finally got through. After providing him with my order number he told me that there were no notes on the file, but that he would speak to the person who last spoke to me. I asked for details of this person and was told his real name and that he was a supervisor at the company. This is the person who identified himself with a fake name. After 10 miutes of being put on hold customer care assistant came back and told me that the issue would not be resolved and there was nothing else he could do. I asked for the name of the manager that was working at the time. He told me, and I asked to speak to the manageee, and I was put on hold again for 10 minutes. When he came back he told me that he could not find the manager. I asked how many people were working with him that evening and he said 5. I explained that it is very hard to believe that you could lose someone in a team of 5. The customer care assistant said he would try to look for him again and he put me on hold. After 10 minutes the call was surreptitiously dropped. I tried to call back and was left in a holding loop for over 20 minutes. I have emailed the company many times to complain. They have yet to respond to a single mail. I spent £2,655.00, thankfully due to distance selling laws, I can claim my money back now that I have returned their goods. I would never do business with this company, and would urge everyone to think twice before using them."
181915,"Bought a GHD thin curve wand a few weeks ago. I have extremely fine hair that never holds any curl for more than 5 minutes. Was sceptical about this gadget’s claims BUT it is amazing! Quick to heat up (10 secs) and easy to use. Gives a lovely, bouncy, spiral curl that lasts ALL day. I’ve walked the dog in woolly hat and windy weather and my hair still looks great afterwards. Would definitely recommend. Well worth the investment"

174091,"This is the second time I've bought from PC Specialist, and once again I am not disappointed.
As a video editor, it's very important to get the right PC - and this is exactly what I've now got thanks to PC Specialist.
They kept me in the loop with update emails, and it only took around a week for my new PC to arrive.
I would highly recommend."
118826,"Received a call a few days ago regarding an upgrade on my current phone/contract. As i have just moved house and started a new job i said to the lady on the phone that at the moment i will leave it until i have time to sit down and work out what phone i want next, she was very polite and did her job very well. I receive a call today from the same number but from a guy this time. I tell the guy the same thing that i don't currently have time to sort it all out and i will continue paying only to be met with a barrage of attitude from him. Telling me he couldn't believe i was happy to continue paying, i said to him that at the moment it isn't the right time and he still persisted with the ongoing rudeness. Upon asking his name........he put the phone down on me. Not sure if this is the level of customer service that needs to be provided by such a large company. I'm a car salesman and understand that i have targets to hit, up selling etc. Butt that is definitely not the way to go around getting sales from people."
113092,"Seriously lousy.
Thought I would try the service after some months and surprise surprise, nothing has changed infact it has probably got worse. Firstly NOW has lost some channels and in order to lessen the blow they've added Kids into entertainment. Why that wasn't originally the case it beyond belief.

I can also now see that they've introduced ADVERTS into this paid-for service?!? And then have the cheek to charge an addition £5 so that I don't have to get ads shoved down my throat. No thanks!!! Which other streaming service only allows streaming on only ONE device?!?

720p streaming quality is pathetic, it's not even industry standard to offer such a lousy stream quality - how can NOW be featured amongst the top service?

Removing features that existed before and moving them behind another paywall is not the way to do sustainable business, infact I will not be surprised if your subscriptions fall of a cliff!

Save your time, effort and sanity and just go with Prime Video and discovery+."
121256,Great company and app! Love the opportunities they have!

Spoken to several members of staff to be told my refund has been processed but clearly has not. When I do ring the customer service after waiting for so long the line goes dead. Have written to the CEO! Ridiculous"
188723,"This review is for JOE KING at BT! You've been awesome!
I do not have a contract with BT so I can't post in the BT community hub. I was approached by my clients who are elderly, vulnerable sisters living on a rural farm. They had been scammed out of their BT contract by another telecom company. By the time they'd come to me with this issue this new company had blocked all out going calls from their landline. They have never had mobile phones or internet, their landline was there only form of communication. They are half a mile away from a neighbouring farm. They are both on walking sticks with medical problems and if they needed emergency services then NOT having a working landline was a serious problem.

When I called BT, I got through to Joe and he has been the holy saviour for my clients! He ensured that the sisters gave me authorization to deal with the situation and he gave me the best advice and guidance on how to deal with this company in order to lift the restrictions and for BT retake the contract.

Joe understood straight away that my clients where vulnerable and I noted straight away that their safety was his main concern. He enabled us to have direct contact with each other to rectify the situation. He even called me at 8.30am the next day to say that the scam company had lifted all restrictions and that BT could now retake over the contract - they had been with BT since a phone was installed in their house decades ago.
He's been prompt at replying to my emails regarding miniscule questions that my clients have wanted answered.

I have never received such great customer service. It may not seem like a big thing to many people, but these elderly vulnerable women where crying in my office because they'd been a victim BUT they where so reassured that Joe was on their side!

BT, give this guy a promotion or a raise! He is a true asset"

167015,"They cancelled my contract, I think in purpose, and asked me to pay £1000 while in the contract is anyway £200.
I would pay if I m wrong but they just play around to make extra money their ways.
Businesses can t get access to recorded calls, so they are always right and we are always wrong, whatever happens better to get all in paper to be safe if not you are in trouble. Never happened in my life such a terrible experience
They will answer in here asking ( after being really sorry ) to contact Bt via messenger or Twitter, nothing happens there as well, how can I talk with someone who cares and not just robots?
Sorry if this sounds too rude but I really hate when someone try to steal money in such a terrible way."

Their business model seems to be, take people's money, keep it and return it only after the person opens a credit with their bank.
It's a total pain. they lie about the date you'll get your money back. There is a whole facebook group about how awful they are.

Spend about 1.40 minutes online help gave up no reply told to keep waiting ,
Day 2 spend 2 hours online help chat , passed from department to department again, finally got a reply to phone a number as unable to cancel on chat , phoned half hour had to give up.
Day 3 on phone close to 2 hours had to give up.
Think this is complete con to make people not cancel broadband.
Someone badly need to investigate this corrupt company

reply from Amii - TalkTalk - more bulshit complete lies, the link only enables cancelation by phone. So I phoned again still no answer for 4th day - complete pack of liers"

106345,Disgusting and dangerous behaviour from a Marks Electrical delivery van that actually tried to shunt into me and run me off the road. Would never buy from a company that employs people that behave like this.
113956,"Marks Electrical have been extremely unhelpful in resolving an issue with our cooker at a residential care home. It failed in just over a year, and it has taken three weeks to be told (very rudely) by the customer services team that it isn't under warranty as it is for commercial use. The address was under the Company name and obviously a care home, but this wasn't mentioned at the time of sale. I wouldn't recommend this company to anybody as aftercare just isn't there."
177678,"Horrible service. Always part of order missing. Drivers asking to go downstairs to collect the order before they arrive as they are not bother to deliver to your door. Phone to contact them not working. Would be quicker to collect by yourself than wait for delivery, walking around to find them and you end up with cold food."

147594,"There's more chance of Dinosaurs roaming the earth by the middle of next week than Talktalk being able to provide the service you pay them for. The only thing worse than Talktalk is Talktalks very own complaints department who amazingly, manage to achieve the impossible of being worse than the other call handlers.

I'm getting 53mbs on future fibre 500 because they don't seem to be able to move me off my old fibre 65 a month ago. My direct debit is cancelled now and I'll be refusing to pay until they sort it out."
170359,"Ridiculous Customer Support.
Have now been on hold for 38 minutes - 'we are busy, very sorry, apologies - will answer as soon as possible'
You would think with the amount they charge they could afford more than one person on the help desk at a time wouldn't you?

Thanks for the reply Dan, and in the end i gave up after an hour and tried the following day - only took 28 minutes then.
Is now a moot point, i have decided to take my business elsewhere."
194550,"Awful aftersales service. I took delivery of two identical fridge freezers and within hours of installation, one makes a grinding noise and smells of burning. After being sent from pillar to post and many telephone calls I was told by a member of the Curry's staff that a replacement would be made and I was to be contacted within 48 hours to arrange a time. Instead, I receive an email asking me to call and on doing so was told that this was a 'lie' and I need to contact the manufacturer because my contract was with them and not Curry's who only sell on behalf of manufacturers. I have contacted the manufacturer who have simply referred me back to Curry's stating my contract as a consumer is with Curry's. I'm now sat with a faulty appliance I cannot use which is only a few days old and nowhere to turn. I have registered a complaint which by the way was during yet another 30 minute telephone call so await the outcome. I wish I hadn't purchased from Curry's and intend never to do so again."

Build to deliver time was 6 days which is great (I used standard build and delivery option) the pc in question was built very well with great cable management. I fitted my own Nvidia 3080 with no problems adding required power cables, the only minor preference would be that the M.2 drive be fitted to the CPU lane m.2 socket rather then the motherboard lane m.2 socket but I moved that myself with no problems. overall a very awesome experience, the pc is amazing !! Thank You and I will use you again in future."
158139,Customer service wait time is awful. Recruit more people.
192551,"The technician is nice and professional.
He thoroughly checked the boiler for us which give us peace of mind."
171102,"Good to be able to get broadband without passing a credit check, but not a great product overall. I'll start with the positives: the speeds are okay for what you pay, the most basic package is fine for two people streaming at once, and when we signed up the equipment arrived very quickly and was installed for free the day it arrived.

Unfortunately this is let down by two things. Firstly, we've had terrible reliability; the internet intermittantly stops working at least twice a day, sometimes for a couple of hours. When you ask for help on the website, you'll get generic information that certainly hasn't helped us.

And that leads on to the second problem: customer service. It's the worst I've ever had from a broadband provider; the call centers are not open on Sundays and the 6 days they are open, it's not very late. We actually called up at a time when they were open on a Friday evening (due to no internet for hours) and a pre-recorded message told us they had to unexpectedly close the customer services phone line due to high staff-absence. This happened again the next day we called. They also don't offer refunds for bad service, although this is to be expected given you aren't tied into a contract for a fixed term.

Overall, cheap and reasonably fast broadband, but unreliable and terrible customer support."

No issue, with no quibbles they took it back and we did a deal on a brand new unit instead. All was well to this point. Getting a full refund on the mis-sold unit has now taken nearly a month and is yet to be resolved even though they processed the return with 48-hours. Please Wex, can I have my money back?"

189525,"I spoke to Charity, a lovely lady from the Shell Energy Support Team. She was a cheerful, helpful and understanding person, who did all she could to sort out my query. When I first rang, I was not feeling very hopeful, as I’d rang an hour before and the system crashed, so I was unable to get anywhere, but by the end of the call, from speaking to Charity, she had fully sorted out my issues and made me feel so much better. We need more advisors like this lady! Thank you Charity, you’ve made my day, I appreciate it."

138167,So I had a quote of £345 for my iPhone 11 Pro Max. The phone was in immaculate condition not 1 single mark on it. When mazuma received it and check it they made me a lower offer of £285 due to multiple scratches on my display. The allow up to 3 scratches! Well there was definitely not 3 scratches let alone the additional ones they said they found! I have accepted the offer as I don’t want the hassle of having to sell it privately but I have asked for images of the scratches as I took photos of the device before I packaged it. It was double bubble wrapped and in a bubble wrap envelope! Rip off if you ask me!!!

It seems like, as of October 6, the software they used has somehow 'expired' (?) so the boxes no longer work. They refused to refund me and just said that they 'could not help me' because I did not have an account (I was unable to set up my account due to the box not working). Avoid NowTV at all costs."

Finally got that sorted and so could update to full fibre. Immediately, had my internet copper line switched off. That was October 6th. Open reach turned up on the 14th November broke drill putting a hole in the wall, then left. BT said not our problem, open reach said not our problem. Currently it is November 18th I have raised a complaint with both, nothing back. I still have no internet and now have a hole on the inside wall of my house and dust all over the floor. Then receive a text saying new date for installation December 2nd. So bad no accountability."
112567,"So easy to find the product you want on the website, it's also a speedy checkout. My parcel arrived on time as stated, all together Wex is a great company to shop at."
115686,"The Scarborough branch (Seamer Road, Scarborough), what can I say.

I returned an item around early December 2022 after the item was defective. This amounted to £325 worth of product that was not working. The staff member that handled it outright refused to refund the item, and would only offer me a gift card. No ifs, no buts, despite telling him what your own website says and what your phone support said.

I went back to the store on the 28th day to return a faulty item. This is within Curry's return policy for faulty item(s), which is blatantly written on your website, and was also told the same by Customer Services over the phone.

This incredibly rude and senior staff member told me I wasn't allowed to refund the item because I only had 14 days. Even when I told him this is false as it is faulty, mentioned the Consumers Act 2015 to reject the goods under law, and that CS told me I was entitled to a refund, he told me they were wrong, and I was two weeks outside the return policy -- explicitly for faulty items -- not an ""unwanted"" item, and said I could only exchange the item for a gift card.

Frustrated and made to feel a muppet in front of customers and staff, I accepted this gift card exchange. I then left, and called Customer Services straight away. The CS rep was incredibly helpful, and even tried to contact the Scarborough store to tell them they were, in fact, wrong (plus tell them that they failed to factor in the extended returns policy for both faulty AND unwanted items.)

The rep couldn't get through to the store, but assured me I *should* return to the store and demand a refund.

I returned roughly an hour later, and conveniently, the senior staff member who outright refused to refund me had ""gone home"", but had the polar opposite experience with another senior staff member, in which he couldn't fathom why the other staff member failed to refund me, and why he loaded a gift card with two different amounts (which confused the staff member when trying to refund me for the £325 gift card as the first staff member failed to give me a receipt -- conveniently -- for the refund AND gift card exchange.) What amazed me more, was when he went (verbatim, as I recorded the verbal conversation) ""I can't understand why he didn't refund you, because even if it wasn't faulty, you were still entitled to a refund under the extended Christmas returns policy we run every single year.""

After spending tens of thousands of pounds with Curry's over recent years, and despite the opposite experience I had when I returned to get a refund (which, can you blame them at that point when he even knew how deceitful the first SM was), I will never shop with you again. I have since moved my business account (which accounted for 80% of my business spending in electronics and technology) to a new supplier, and will be requesting Curry's remove my business account and personal details.

That is a statement to how appalling my local branch treated me, which, by the way, cost me hours in travelling and personal time to sort the problem. I will now no longer make any purchases via both online and brick and mortar stores for personal purchases, ending my loyalty to Curry's entirely.

Unfortunately, as you can't contact local branches anymore for CS, I never got an honest answer as to why that particular staff member was hellbent on lying. He knew the policy, he's been in that store almost every time I've been in over the last several months -- he knew what he was doing. He didn't want to be responsible for taking a return of £325, and instead, literally lied and conned me into believing I was wrong and your own CS was wrong. Manipulative, but frankly, embarrassing, as they have ultimately cost Curry's a loyal and frequent customer."

107069,I went to your shop not knowing which phone to get and was advised to buy a Huawei. I really liked the phone and asked the two salesmen would it work with an apple watch to which they both replied yes. Now I have the phone and a watch that can't pair with it. I feel a bit tricked into the sale to be honest and even though I like the phone I now have a useless watch as I was misled

I am very disappointed because carphone warehouse took £1 for my account apparently to verify my bank details and they suppose to give me back that £1 at the end they took £2 from my bank account and never refunded me that money and this is the second time that has happened to me. Two years ago was exactly the same I never received my money back, seems this is like a strategy to make money for their customers, is few but still is dishonest"

I did all the resets and tested it with another router from my neighbour to make sure the router was at fault. Called Virgin Media, the get the router replaced. Either by an engineer or post replacement. They tried every trick in the book to fob me off saying I will be charged if an engineer comes out as their diagnostic test says the broadband is working.(which it wasn’t) they finally agreed to send an engineer to replace the router and then the day before we received a text saying the fault had been fixed in the appointment was cancelled. I then spent over an hour on the phone on Sunday logging a complaint and being passed around and having to repeat myself. I’m now waiting for a call back from the complaints team within 48 hours. All they had to do was replace the router, even by post and would have been happy and not have to waste everyone’s time calling up the call center. I don’t know what’s going on with them but it seems like no one is steering the ship and that the company is a complete mess. I feel sorry for the staff as they must get so much stress and abuse from upset customers. Worst company to deal with, you can guarantee that you will get bad customer service every time you call."

Went to the store in Chester and the staff told me they didn’t have any in stock but informed i could check stock on the website which was helpful. Managed to order online again, and received my product in just over a week.

Only criticism is the box was ripped, and I paid for an A condition product. I would not expect the packaging to be ripped on an A condition product."

171398,"This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. They have taken £245 for a shed I bought and say they can’t deliver it to the address I wanted because it’s different from my home address and they are refusing to help resolve this. I call customer service who tell me they can’t help and hang up. I have registered a complaint and was expecting a call back the next day from a Manager. It has now been a week… no call. I have today received a text from the delivery company who say they are delivering the shed tomorrow to the wrong address. The customer service is shocking. I’d advise anyone thinking of using this company not to and if I could have rated it no stars I would have

UPDATE:
I called as advised to ‘discuss my review’ and the call center adviser knew nothing of the review and told me he couldn’t help me.

NO SURPRISE THERE!

Studio still have my £245 and are refusing to resolve this issue!"
106993,f you're going for the new Quidco cashback now TV aren't being very quick about paying the last lit out and read the small print you can only have the speed if it's available in your area. They don't tell you if you can have that speed.
138493,What an absolute joke. Booked a timeslot of 1-5pm for delivery of my fridge freezer. Didn't arrive so contacted the call centre. As I was in the phone it looked like the driver turned up so I got off the phone. I could see him having an animated chat on the phone and I waited for him to finish. He drove off without delivering my order! He didn't even get out of the van to ring my buzzer nor call me. I rang the call centre back who tried to contact him to come back as he had gone onto the next drop. Haven't heard anything and call centre now closed. I spent all morning defrosting my fridgefreezer and trying to keep my freezer stuff frozen. Waited in all afternoon. Spent an hour on the phone trying to get through to the call centre and I have no new fridgefreezer. Disgusting.
144154,"Been without mobile signal for about a week now. Spoke to the agent on the end of the webchat only to be told that work is being carried out and should be finished soon.

Will TRY and leave when my contract ends!

**Update**

Still having issues and told.it is fixed. No such luck.

I got email and text confirmation from them before that broadband service will be disconnected only on 22 January 2023, not earlier. How could they make such a mistake？ Is it their way to punish their customer for leaving them? Should they know how inconvenient it is without internet connection? I have spent more than an hour on the phone to request them to restore the service and they said the service will be back only in 3 hours. So, now I am waiting ...
I also filed a formal complaint to them. I am not sure if this is their trick or if they just make mistakes like this. I would like to hear what they would say."

114069,Appalling. Didn’t turn up and I had to take a day off to take delivery etc. Plus nearly 200 extra for installation and recycling. Complete waste of a days holiday. I had to call them after seeing the status of the delivery move from on its way back to order in progress. They said they’d had a gas leak and therefore couldn’t get to us. Total rot! Curry’s must have more than one gas safe engineer working for them. I cancelled the order. Bizarrely the status on the tracker now states they tried to deliver but nobody home. Not satisfied with making me waste a whole days holiday they have to call me a liar as well! DONT FALL FOR THEIR PROMISES THEY WONT DELIVER!

168865,"Everything else except the delivery went completely fine. I got exactly what I ordered. The website was easy to navigate. They have a good but limited selection of parts. I think the decision of FedEx being the delivery service is poor, as I dislike FedEx, but I will rate them separately. My PC came in but I saw horizontal green lines on my display immediately after booting it up. After troubleshooting for an entire day, I came to the conclusion that it is a faulty graphics card, and my guess is that something happened during delivery of the product. I trust PCSpecialist when they say that they tested and did quality control, but at the end of the day, there was something wrong with the PC. I contacted support on the website, and they've been fairly responsive and I will be sending back the graphics card for a replacement most likely. If I receive another faulty graphics card, I will update this review if I can because that would be ridiculous. I have little trust in FedEx, so PCS using FedEx is worrying me a bit."
127221,Lovely product decent price quick delivery

153790,"Seriously don't go near this useless company. I tried to get a fibre connection from them and first they cancelled my previous provider before they managed to connect me to Vodafone then when the engineers arrived to connect the fibre cable they said they would have to dig up the middle of my new drive to lay the cable when i said this can't happen they said ok we will come back next week to lay the cable avoiding ruining my drive.
After a week without broadband different engineers arrived and also wanted to dig up my drive i explained to them that they should lay the cable along the pavement then along my fence hence avoiding any damage to the drive they said they couldn't do this and left.
I contacted Vodafone again and asked if they could supply a dongle to tide me over until i can get connected they told me they would send one the next day but after 3 days no dongle.
I decided to contact the company that lay the fibre cables along the pavement to the connection box which is called a Tobi box The person i spoke to confirmed thet it would have been easy to reroute the fibre cable to my house.
After 14 days without broadband and speaking to 5 different call centre people who all reassured me they could fix this problem i told them i would have to cancel this contract they said ok as a goodwill gesture they would give me £20 for my troubles but no didn't send anything.
So look elsewhere for your broadband to avoid these cowboys.

Received a DVD box set that sadly is region 1, so therefore unplayable in UK/Europe. Informed Music Magpie and requested returns details. Details still not supplied.
Then i discovered that one of the discs is badly scratched.
DVD case however is of interest to me (even without the discs).
Wrote to Music Magpie again stating that I would be prepared to keep box set for the case alone, if they would issue me with a partial refund. Once again, no reply received.
Please can someone look into this for me."
100351,Excellent experience from start to finish. I now have a super fast computer with a top spec for a very low cost. Top company.
138666,"I have had countless issues over the years but I’m at a point now where enough is enough.

Due to moving house and not having broadband for 2 weeks, I agreed a new contract on top of my phone contract, for mobile broadband. I had the mobile broadband for 2 days and worked fine. Then I get a message to call 191. Call them and a guy said there’s an issue and they need to set up a new account on their side to fix it. I made it clear i didn’t want to lose service as I was starting a new job the next day. Low and behold, the next day I have no mobile phone or mobile broadband service. My line was cut off and took me all day to get back on.

I spoke to someone a few days later to cancel the mobile broadband contract. He was throwing his colleague under the bus saying he didn’t understand why he messed about with it. I was then told that the bill had been put up around £6 and the billing date was changed. The guy was happy to fix it but this is a major breach of contract.

Despite this, I was still chased and threatened to have service cut for a wrong bill amount. I cleared this up and escalated a complaint further.

I have limited access on the app now so can’t pay a bill or view the full statement. I also have pretty much moderate 3G or dreadful 4G in my home and even worse at my work. The case handler in the complaints team is not understanding why I want to be able to cancel my contract early and is insisting that I stay in my contract until it ends in Feb 2024.

After all of the issues and current signal issue, all I want is to move to someone else. Due to this, I’m currently going to be requested all information on my accounts through GDPR and forming a case for OFCOM/CISAS. This company cannot force people to stay in a contract for something they can’t use."
120252,"Product was as decribed
Willing to agree to discount on advertised prices and prompt delivery as promised."
122424,"Allow upgrades within the contract period.
To get broadband in every room I have had to purchase at my own cost mesh satellite system costing over £1,000.
The voice over IP home telephone is not really suited to our alarm panel I've had to have that modified in case of mains failures as it also runs our fire alarms."
153220,"Great product. The washer dryer was delivered and installed by ao.com staff who were really excellent, one of the gentleman even fixed an outstanding plumbing issue!!! Above and beyond customer service. Just incredibly kind and helpful. Really exceptional thankyou."
103985,"They contacted and I asked for 1 phone back after under evaluation and lying and stating a screen problem. Sent back without the original box which is classed as theft.

The second phone they didn't give option for the amount offered so I could decline or accept. They then put £2.50 into the bank and never communicated. Again mis sold service and theft.

Do not use this company"
173782,Staff extremely helpful and quick to rectify the problem.
186138,"got a letter from Team Knowhow to renewal my daughters (age 11) mobile phone insurance. Was asked to quote my details, etc, but i stumbled on the last part of my postcode, so my husband quoted it to me in the background (a simple, human, thing to do (especially as i care for my disabled daughter and get very little sleep)). Anyway, that was enough for the member of staff to stop my renewal. I was then asked to go into a store and renew it. I am fuming !!!! What a joke. A simple memory slip up and now i am being penalised and asked to make a round trip of 30 miles (with my disabled daughter - who is shielding). I have attempted contacting Carphone Warehouse before and keep getting passed from pillar to post. Disgraceful. What if you have a speech impediment? or something similar? I am NOT a happy customer.

Fao Craig at Carphone Warehouse :... I have already done this and been passed around multiple departments, and still no reply! Have also emailed the ceo Mr James!

17th Dec 2020 still no resolution from this company. Not happy"
104553,Staff knowledge and willingness to answer all the questions. Nigel the Watford branch manager is very good!
150100,The Interface is crap! Why change something that worked! Totally different to all other streaming sites! Not user friendly! I actually avoid even searching it’s so bad!
190439,I have had nothing but problems with Studio. Missing parcel took over 6 weeks to resolve and get the credit back. Now they added interest onto my account when everything was paid on time. I recommend that everyone checks the interest added onto accounts.

160911,Orders goods for pre Christmas delivery on the 14th December. Did not arrive in time for Christmas. Wrote 7 emails to customer service Christmas week. Did not receive a reply asked for refund still no reply. Christmas has been and still do not have my product. The worst customer service I have ever experienced in retail. Seems like this company does not care about their reputation. Would never shop with them again
155782,Fast and was given a free mouse
168953,"Fantastic service, couldn't be better. Saw a tumble dryer online Saturday, ordered and delivered Sunday morning. Delivery notifications couldn't have been better, evening of order recieved a 2 hr timeslot for following morning, then next morning another email confirming delivery on way with an exact delivery time. Great."

104177,"I recieved a message to contact them regarding my repair. I waited a hour and a half on hold to speak to someone and had to pay 5p a minute for the privilege. They then ""accidentally"" hung up on me. Already wishing I had never dealt with them. I've given up on the repair I just want my laptop back to take elsewhere."
183580,"Sent brand new phone with plastic still on it, they lied and said had more than 5 scratches. Low ball offer very low. DO NOT SELL YOUR PHONE HERE!"
183132,"Quality product, my daughter loves it"
104793,Order did not arrive. Had to reorder. Will now arrive after Christmas.
196601,Absolute rubbish from service team. I get a rolling discount every month but they seem to be really confused about this. I sorted it and the man said this problem would never happen again. But it happens again and again. The woman I spoke to just would not put me through to the customer relations. Really bad attitude. Bad service . Its a minus 3 for me today
127814,We want to exchange the cattle because the surface of the cattle is very hot after making the water warm. Then I tried to exchange in store but they refused.

145027,Simple to use and quick payout. Good service
178830,Love the app it’s easy to set up and easy to get started
168206,Emra V answered my question straight away. Shell on the other hand should look at changing their billing layout.
164773,"I don't know if y'alls get rewards for reviews that mention by name, but after a short wait, Joe from the Lincolnshire Hub answered my query in a single message. It was only a small question but it was still great to get a helpful response so quickly."
129907,#MakeitRight? Over ten years as a loyal customer despite only ever receiving a Galaxy S3 from them. They are obviously now not happy with the money they have been making. So have forced me from my contract to one with much less favourable terms and functionality(although these have rarely been used). I left them before the contract change. They still keep taking money but at the new contract rate which I refused to go on. This when I left them nearly a month ago. No point dealing with them. They will just give you the run around and cost you more in the long run. It's a licence to steal.
169266,Easy to use had contact from trades people and quoted given and I have picked who will undertake the work
103641,Great advisor due to separation & my step children not receiving their presants I had to send them back. Never get engaged is my advice

180933,"I have to wait up to 45 days for ear buds, what good is a phone without ear buds. Now I have to wait and won't get the enjoyment of listening to music. I wonder if I paid for them would I have to wait 45 days???"
167457,"If I could give zero stars I would!
All started when I went into the Eastbourne store and left in tears after being so rudely spoken to. All I wanted was to upgrade my phone.
I then filed a formal complaint to just receive an email saying little more than sorry.
I then should’ve known better but have always used Carphone warehouse in the past.
I did the whole live chat thing... mistake! I asked for an upgrade and after being cut off three times finally had someone I thought understood what I wanted and helped me process my upgrade. Got my new phone, followed SIM card instructions and carried on with life. Until three weeks later when I go my first bill from Vodafone, £145! Thought it was strange as I’d taken out a lower priced tariff of £46.. I phoned straight away and was told I now had two hand sets?!! One for £85 pm and my old one £60pm.. explained I’d actually asked for an upgrade and was told an investigation (after basically being told it must’ve been my mistake and if they can’t find the chat transcript I’ll have to pay for the full new contract) would then happen and I’d hear via email after 24hrs... nothing! Phoned again two days later, told it would be 3-5days. I then emailed my chat transcript through and didn’t even get a response.
Phoned again two days later and it took me three different calls to get through to be told now 7-10 days.. phone after 7 days and told it’s actually 3-5 days from when I sent in the transcript but they’re still looking for their copy and I should phone back again in 5 days!
In the meantime I haven’t paid my bill on Vodafone’s advice but they obviously want this resolved as soon as possible. Wednesday is still two days away and it will then have been two weeks since my original phone call.. if anyone else tells me they’re sorry for the inconvenience I’m going to scream. There should be a team to phone you when a massive mistake has been made not the other way round... once this is resolved I will never ever use them again!! Be warned!!"
145779,"Prompt and efficient, no fuss. It seems that no order is too small."
187922,They use DPD and don’t make it clear that you can’t leave instructions to leave parcel with neighbour and charge to change delivery day.

113338,Well if you look at my post about talk talk you will understand my anger. So I went to bt as I was told they are the best?? Anyway ordered my broadband on the 10th of April and was told ever thing was good 🙄🙄 anyway long story short they can't give me broadband because someone else owns the line???? So I called them to day and the advice was find someone else 😂😂😂 so 2 months later they ask me to send the hub back and find someone else???? After two engineers coming to my property and this is how your treated. Oh and by the way they also try to take money out your account 😳😳x
179821,Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Had the product I wanted. No problems.

107543,"Great service and at a good price, quite happy to recommend."
138056,"Absolutely appalling service. Paid insurance for 7 years on a fridge freezer, took three weeks from it breaking down to finally receiving an e voucher for £230 less than the original purchase price, which was based on a smaller capacity model not to the same specification, hours spent on phone calls to no avail, extremely annoyed will take our custom elsewhere in future."

Five days later, still nothing in my account, so send message to customer service, who nicely tell me ""Unfortunately, we cannot see that the payment has bounced, so we request that you send us a copy of your bank statement [cut] to include the account number and sort code as well as payment amounts and payment dates however, you may redact any other personal information. Once we receive this, we will pass it on to a member of our accounts team to investigate further.""
Nice. Not going to investigate until I can prove I haven't received the money?!
I've asked for a transaction reference number for the payment, but they have not responded. So for this, no stars.
Update 21/12: finally, (today) I have been told that the payment bounced due to an error in the details. It's a shame I can't actually see if the bank details are correct, because the website stars most of it out even though I have to log in twice to get there. Still no transaction reference number, but maybe I'll actually get the payment ""in the next few days."""

171582,The AIR Mini Grand would not install properly....ever....after many try's. Thankfully I had purchased the M-Audio Oxygen Pro 61from Sweetwater and it came with the Mini Grand trial and it installed without any issues and I was able to use the license with that installation.
109324,"Will never recommend NOWTV to anyone. Terrible service. None of the advisors care, they talk over you, and when you confront them about something they put you on hold. When you ask to speak to the manager then they say their not there. So who's exactly running that place, staff? Terrible customer service and attitude on the Customer services representative! Will take my custom elsewhere. Where my custom is more appreciated. Buy NowTV subscription!!!"

She has confirmed my bank details, trade-in amount and address and she said that she had sent a refund. We have Monday 16/05/22 and still, I haven't received anything. I have enough of this ridiculous situation and I have raised a small claim in court. Absolutely abysmal and useless the company!""

Turns out they were charging me every month after, and when I went into a 3 store, they told me I had to call them and cancel. This was not made clear AT ALL on any of the forms. This should be made clear, but instead they purposely make it complicated to understand. I will never use 3 again, they're an awful company and they should be investigated. Disgusting."

117195,"After reading horrendous reviews I was worried when I’d sent my laptop off to be repaired. I’d bought laptop for £499 in October so is still under the years warranty when black and white lines appeared on the screen. Collected when said from know how, and got regular updates on the progress of repair. Got a message yesterday asking me to contact them as had information for me ( not sure why they couldn’t ring me) and was told that the laptop had be written off due to a part not being made anymore, was told I would receive a voucher for the full amount paid within 5 days, and couldn’t believe it when received today. All worked great and new laptop ordered. Very happy with outcome after originally feeling worried. Really feel for all the customers that have been left without for months on end, really not fair and they should really sort it out as it is not acceptable. But I have personally had a good experience so Thankyou."

120414,"Delivery was tracked and received within a couple of days and the delivery people were polite about the parcels so that's great.

HOWEVER I ordered a funko pop mystery box and another item in one order which was in stock at the time and paid for both in the same order, payment was taken but when the delivery came I was missing my mystery box yet I had already paid for it.

I emailed HMV and got no response. I've had no update at all to apologise or to tell me the box wasn't coming or even offer a refund for the item.

Quite disappointed as it clearly said in stock and took payment at the time."
181210,"Brilliant service, updated on my delivery all the time, you can tell they try and do that extra bit of service for you.
The equipment itself is brilliant, I got this on a really good deal, and was a bit dubious if it would be off quality, but be assured you get more than what you pay for in terms of what’s on the market.

133908,"After switching Now Broadband sent an email (which I missed) containing small print advice that they were changing my phone number (I've raised a complaint to OFCOM who have levied fines on providers for doing this). By the time I noticed this they had de-activated my previous phone number and as a result my previous provider had no way of validating that I existed. So I accepted my fate that I was stuck with a new phone number and Now Broadband. However, the new broadband phone number wasn't working either. I explained to an agent that my wife and I are both 85 yrs old, highly vulnerable and depend upon our phone for carer and emergency services, the agent assured me that the engineer visit the following day would result in the phone number being activated. I received further assurances from another agent that everything would be fine after the engineer had been. After waiting the 5 hours from 08:00 until 13:00 for the engineer, the engineer didn't turn up, I chased Now Broadband who matter of factly told me the engineer had been cancelled. I told another agent to stop the transfer, that one way or another I will get back to my existing provider and that I will be raising a complaint to OFCOM and to the Ombudsman. This morning I received a message from Openreach advising an engineer will be attending tomorrow to activate the phone number and I also received an email advising they will be billing m £18 for the first month's service. At the start of this switch I thought ""what could possibly go wrong"", well Now Broadband have excelled themselves at finding every possible way of failing to comply with regulation and screwing up their service"

134865,"Been a Three customer for many years. was trying to upgrade my phone and have had constant issues. First attempt I used the website to upgrade, all seemed to go well, I got emails confirming the contract. Then no phone delivered for a full working week (website advertises next day delivery for UK mainland). I then used the live chat function on their website and was told I hadn't completed my upgrade (even though I had reviewed contracts via email...). I get my upgrade sorted with the chap on the chat, who stated I would receive the phone on the 15th. Its now the 15th and still no phone delivery...Again I raise this on the chat functionality and now get told delivery will be the 17th, their website really pushes this order before 8pm receive your phone next day promise. Seems like false advertising now. Not a happy customer, shouldn't be a task for me to pay three more money over the next 24 months...Only reason its not 1 star is previous years of good service."

167119,"I bought a refurbished iPhone 8 from Envirofone in March and it recently developed a fault. After contacting Envirofone, they very quickly emailed back with a link to download and print a prepaid returns label. The phone was sent back on Friday, I received an email on Monday to say they’d received it, followed by a further email on Tuesday to say a replacement was on the way, and the replacement arrived today (Wednesday). The original phone was “as new”, and the replacement was of the same standard. They say you can only judge an organisation’s customer service on how it deals with problems, and in this case, Envirofone have been exemplary. I would unhesitatingly recommend them and they will be my first port of call when buying again."

I have sent my phone for repair In march as it was under the warranty. No communication as they take around 2 weeks to respond to my email Saying they are going to issue a refund and it will be 21/05. Of course, the date came and I have received an email

( Owing to the current Government guidelines a few of our departments are working with limited staff numbers and some refunds are taking longer than usual. I have requested our finance department to look into your order and they have advised that you will be receiving your refund on or before 30th of June 2021. I am aware this date is longer than our standard timeframe but I can assure you we are all working to ensure services to our customers are uninterrupted as much as possible. We appreciate your patience and are apologise for any inconvenience caused. )

154464,"UPDATE 11/1
I first contacted them on 31/12 and they’d just Facebook messaged me to say no update just yet. I emailed the Trustpilot team the day after they replied to my review and never heard from them either. It was a blanket reply.

Trying to sell my old iPhone to them as it has been sat in the cupboard for sometime.

I went to queue up at the Portsmouth Currys store for over an hour and finally greeted by the staff to say their system was down so I should use the postage method, fine.

Phone was sent to them within 10 days of receiving a quote (£150) with Royal Mail tracking proof. Understandably Christmas is peak period so they couldn’t proceed it till 28th. As a result they can only give me £130 but I held up my end of the bargain as the quote would stand for 14 days!

I believe the phone is at its tip-top condition and the email didn’t specify why there was £20 short. I can see though, the quote to sell on their site is now at £130 so this must be it.

Tried to ring them, but the number was 0870 so I’d have to pay. I rang the free phone number and said they couldn’t do it cause system was down. Fine, I’d Facebook DM them. The chap spent 2pm-9pm asking me pointless questions when the whole thing is incredibly straightforward. Now today, someone else is dealing with my enquiry and he completely missed the mark and I have had to explain the whole situation to him again.

I really do get Christmas means delay but at least hold up your end of the bargain? £20 isn’t a lot but at this point it is more about principle for me! Should have used MusicMagpie!"

Appalling customer service, terrible wifi. feature the same four awful, jarringly distorted, yet annoyingly catchy songs which Now tv play whilst they put you on hold an hour, only for the call to end without getting through atleast 4 out of 5 times. To put this into perspective I have had to call them up about multiple problems over the course of a year, from the wifi not working, to them accidentally cancelling it and then being unable to put it back on, to them still charging me when I had left, and then them charging me for leaving early when they hadn't even cancelled my contract. This very minute I am trying to use the web chat service to get through to them after my many calls failing this week... what a surprise - I've been number 5 in the queue for 20 mins. This is without a doubt the worst experience as a customer I have ever had. I dread to think the hours I have wasted due to their incompetence and how busy they are when you try and contact them. Its as if theres one guy in the whole of UK running their customer service department.

I ordered a Google Pixel 6 phone from Carphone Warehouse. The phone took over 10 days to arrive. When I tried to set the phone up it said ""Google LLC has set up this device to be managed by your organisation"". If this is an error, contact the device's provider.

I contacted Carphone Warehouse to ask about this, they acknowledged it was a faulty device but were unable to replace the device as it was out of stock. They offered a refund but that doesn't help the fact that I wasted a lot of time ordering the phone, waiting for it to arrive and trying (and failing) to set it up.

I would not reccommend Carphone Warehous to anyone else."

I was miss sold a product in Manor West Tralee. I paid 750 for a phone that I cant use.
They didn't tell me that Google services wouldn't work on the phone, and then received no support from.the store or headoffice thereafter.
Basically they took my 750 euros and rubbed their hand all the way to the bank.
Went to Vodafone the next day and asked to buy the same phone and they gave me a full rundown on the phone and informed me the phone had no Google services. Well done Vodafone.
Will never put my foot over the door of CPW and be recomending my customers not to use them either.
Awful customer service, rude and condescending.

It was easy to build my custom pc and pick out any item I wanted, they even had rtx3090's in stock!

The website is nice too as you can see which step of the process they are at whether it be ordering parts, building, testing, etc

I also used their support who were helpful and answered all my questions quickly

I really like the fact they use DPD for deliveries which again is a great company as they keep you up to date telling you exactly (to the minute) when your delivery will be made.
It turned up at my door on time and really well packaged, no scratches, with an extra box of things like manuals, wifi antenna, etc

The only problems I had with the pc was:
1. A usb-c issue where the back 2 usb ports wouldnt work with my quest 2 but the front port does. It seems to be a usb controller driver issue which many other people are having at the moment
2. If you are thinking of getting an 11th gen intel cpu to use with a quest 2, just know at the moment (December 2021) there are some issues with playing certain unreal engine games, the pc link app home area not loading correctly, etc
These issues can be fixed with a workaround in some cases where you just need to add a environment variable OPENSSL_ia32cap. Search google for... intel openssl-sha-crash-bug-requires-application-update

I will definitely be using pcspecialist again"

No tracking given. Contacted customer services on 22nd as I had not received. Customer services stated the package was ‘lost’ and would send a replacement. 28th Nov still waiting. Too many packages ‘lost’, undelivered or delayed due to the use of a dodgy courier service."

197523,"Disgusting service.

I have been a loyal 3 customer for 6 years with no previous issues if anything always complimentary. I called them with a network issue in January followed all the steps to resolve this and it didn’t help at all, I have spent the last several months trying to contact them to no avail then when I got through to a manager he was clearly working off a script and was no help at all. I explained I wanted my service to actually work and he offered no help in this regard so I explained I wished to leave the contract and he stated this will only be agreed if I send him my phone back, despite having already paid £250 upfront for this phone and £50 a month every month since then all for nothing and my signal not to work? How does this make sense? And when I asked how this helped he said the best they could do was 2 months free, but then I’d go back to paying £50 a month for nothing as I still have no signal. I have never witnessed such shocking customer service. After I explained my situation he simply said that’s it and pushed me to the side and ended my conversation with no regard or help. This is disgusting and me and my family will be going to our local news agents and telling this story as I have all screenshots of this disgusting treatment."

I fear it will go down hill now with non understandable foreign agents."
196688,"Website was easy to navigate and custom build was easy to put together with plenty of options to choose from. I was particularly impressed that if any selected items would cause hardware conflicts or duplicate functions (ie adding a wifi card if motherboard already has built in wifi) then it would warn you to change your selection before proceeding.

The processing/pre-production phase felt a bit like sitting in limbo due to the vague timeframes involved, but it’s understandable that certain components are harder to source in the current climate. I was pleased to receive notifications at every stage of the process, and once production was started, everything moved along promptly and delivery was nice and quick after dispatch.

My finished product arrived in perfect condition and was everything I had expected it to be.

Overall I’m very happy with the product and service received, and would definitely recommend PC Specialist to others"
187531,When I ordered the product online it advertised that it came with a free gift but when the product arrived no free gift accompanied it. Turns out that if another promo code is used then the free gift is withdrawn. The advert does not clearly state this and is misleading.

You cannot exonerate yourselves from a bundle advertised on your website with a phone and secondly, the monthly cost the contract was £10 higher as the monthly cost advertised on mpd website was £24.00 per month however when 3 network sent the welcome letter they stated my contract was £34.00 per month, not happy with the whole situation hence had to cancel the contract within 14 days."
167553,"Best customer service I’ve ever received,
Had a fault, reported and engineer booked through text message (no sitting around on hold) engineer was out in a couple of days and resolved issue first visit. Friendly engineer. Honestly could not have asked for a better service. Been with Bt for almost 2 years now - tried multiple other companies not on the OR network and worked in telecommunications myself previously and I don’t think I’ve ever seen a better service than the one I received last week."
168197,"Very poor customer service. Mid-billing period I changed broadband provider, and cancelled my contract with Shell. My final bill of 24th August showed my account was in credit, and a small refund was owed to me.

When this didn't appear in my bank account I emailed them, and was told they'd then raise a BACS payment - no automatic refund process in place - and would receive my refund in 'at least 10 working days'.
20 working days have now passed since that email with no sign of my refund. I've just emailed them again only to receive the same reply, a ""refund has been approved and will be reflected in your bank account soon"".

No accompanying apology. When will these firms Learn to take responsibility and apologise when they get it wrong?

Disgraceful lack of customer service. I will certainly avoid all Shell Energy products in the future."

It has taken me 6 months of continued stress and a chain of around 80 emails. The company has no phone number and email response takes days. They would not give me my money back or a different phone. I had to buy another brand new phone in the end. It has put me off buying a refurbished phone again. They should not be allowed to get away with it!"

I thought maybe I went out for a while. Then they said they will deliver it again as soon as they receive the handset.
For 3 days I get no update, then I call back, This time they go ""We used the wrong details to check your credit hence we had to request the return of the handset and need to perform a second credit check so we were waiting for your approval on this.""
Waiting for my approval without giving me any update. Wow.
Then I said go ahead. But even after about a week I get no response. Then I call back again and they go your second credit check failed and you will be refunded within 3 days.
I get no refund hence I call back again then they said sorry your refund haven't been processed yet. We'll refund you within 3-5 working days from today.

Its been 5 days today and yet not refunded. Tired of keep calling but just cant let go of my money.

Horrible services and website.

Absolutely nonononono.......

Update: I called them again today, and after 1 hr of holding, they go like we just checked the phone that's returned to us (which I never received hence I dont know what they needed to check) so we'll start the refund today and it'll take about 5-7 working days for the money to be transferred to your account."
143573,"I was after a new phone it said on the website that once everything goes through the phone will be with you the next day. It's very difficult to get hold of anyone when I did the 1st time after 45 minutes i was told ""oh there just checking credit checks"" hopefully by tomorrow there send a email so 2 days later nothing I tried to email them no email address the website is rubbish just take you around in circles I phoned them again 40m then the line was so bad for them phoned again 50m I wasn't give up I was told well nothing really just that they phone me again after 30 minutes because it will take the system that long ect ect so very poor experience and I've had so many junk emails I'm really scared about giving them my card details they really should be stopped being able to do business there's just a big scam company"

Ordered a telly and it came 4 days late and the screen was cracked.

Tried to get in contact to get a replacement was on hold for an hour!

I finally got through to sort the replacement, the new delivery date was 10 days away!

Got the second tv and the screen was totally smashed! Gave up trying to talk to someone so I tried to web chat. I had to wait a further 8 or so days to get the second one replaced.- this one can through and there are 2 black lines through the middle.

Started with the webchat this time. And the agent said they have contacted the team, given them all the information and added notes to my file and to call them in the morning and they will sort everything out.


Called them this morning, no one had a clue what was going on. I was passed through to 3 different departments and hung up on. Was on the phone for over an hour having the same conversation.

I can’t get a replacement. can’t get a refund.

I’m stuck with a broken telly!

First year was nice no complaints, second not to bad but the last 2 years was a nightmare.. first their service online stopped working as many times as i try to update my readings it was going off and nothing got updated. Tryed to call and use online char but that was same no results..and than i gave up.. not they send me mail saying sorry their system was shut for last 2 years and couldnt get it going!! Well thats a lie and they have to be and scums to make ppl believe that. I did complaint i asked to get this sorted and been told will be done within a week. Not its 8weeks after and no results i made maybe 8-10 calls wasted my time and energy speaking with these scums but just a waste.. at the last day they send me new updated direct debit of over £510 a month.. so i just told them to go on a middle finger and left. Would never ever come back.. advisors are di*kheads some cant speak in english And most cant handle any stress and pressure on than. Joke not a company and owners cant squeeze their little brains in a pot full sh** where they belong."

180790,"We tried to sell several times to cex/webuy. We contacted them prior to sending the items to confirm the prices as we could not find them online. We gave them the exact part numbers and they double-checked the prices. When the items arrived at Cex/WeBuy they queried every item, stated they did not sell the item or said they would only buy if I accepted 80% less for each item. Disgraceful, suspicious and untrustworthy. Avoid using Cex/WeBuy at all costs.

FOLLOW-UP
What nonsense from Cex. We repeatedly asked them for the prices for our items and even quetied themm with Cex but they assured us they were correct. We gave them exact part numbers but after they received the items and after we had agreed a price they claimed they did not sell them. The also tried to force us to take 80% less than we iriginally agreed. Nobody has contacted us regarding the ""investigation""."

141833,"10/10 service from both Lloyd and Anca. I emailed in the early hours of Tuesday morning to ask for a price match, and got a prompt reply at 9:40am saying that unfortunately they did not have the TV I wanted in stock, but telling me which other Richer Sounds did. Great service.

I went to the Watford store anyway, and Anca greeted me, giving me an extremely detailed run through of the technical differences between their different products. Whilst we were talking, Lloyd had received a cancellation for the TV I wanted - and so we managed to get that one right there and then. Happy days - and they beat the price of a rival competitor by £10 as part of their offer. Lloyd also kept up all the promises of the VIP Club service, and helped lift the TV to the car with me and my father.

Honestly, all around one of the best shopping experiences I’ve ever had. If every retail company was like Richer Sounds, the world would be a better place - and the same goes for if every employee was like Lloyd and Anca! Will definitely come here again."

114458,"My father-in-law had arrange for broadband to be fitted and was given a time between 1pm-6pm he had to work so my partner took a day off work(he’s self employed paid daily so lost out on a days pay) travelled by bus for 2 hours (no train service running) and sat in his dads house all day waiting for them, he was there from 12.30pm to make sure he wouldn’t miss them. When they didn’t turn up he called to see what was happening, to speak to a very rude agent that advised he missed the appointment. When he pointed out that he has been sat on a chair by the window and had been watching and listening for the door(my partner is quite impatient so he would of been watching constantly and listening for the door on tender hooks) he was called a lier. Although my father-in-law advised multiple times that he was hard of hearing and was finding it hard to under the agent could he speak to his son, the agent kept refusing to talk to my partner. He then wanted to charge a fee to re-arrange the appointment. In the end he cancelled, but again they tried to tell him he wasn’t entitled to a refund for the fee he paid upfront, this was eventually refunded and he has gone with someone else. Also to make a further point my partner went to the shop next door whose security camera catches the gate into my father-in-laws front garden and has ask them to look through the CCTV for the times they were suppose to come and absolutely no one came to his door. I feel it was a total scam to try and add extra charges. I wouldn’t care I’ve since learned from others how bad there service is and how bad there customer service advisers are. I have nothing against foreign call centres but at least make sure that your staff can speak the language as apparently the guy on the phone could barely understand them and just kept repeating himself as reading from a script until my partner was arguing his point back then he got very rude and abrupt as I say at one point actually calling my partner a lier."

139831,"We are moving home and on the 10th October 2022. On the 13th September asked BT to close our internet and telephone line at the old property and reinstate at the new property on the 10th October 2022.
Received confirmation back that BT were shutting off our landline and internet at our old property on 30th September and connecting our new service to an address that is unknown to us on the 10th October.
After informing BT of their mistake this order was closed (allegedly) and after a week a new order was put through with the correct address and correct dates.
On 30th September we lost broadband and landline at our old address and after numerous calls was told that one of BTs departments had not been informed and had therefore cut us off from 30th September. We were informed that BT could not reinstate the lines but all was set for the new property on the 10th October.
10th October we have no broadband and no landline in the new property. I have contacted BT and I have been informed that this order has failed ????? and they will have to set up a new order and therefore i will have to wait a further 3-6 weeks for landline and internet.
I obviously am not prepared to do this and will seek out another supplier by end of business today unless this issue can be resolved swiftly."

146762,"Placed an order with Carphone Warehouse online which seemed pretty straight forward. Delivery address was messed up on the system (no fault of mine) and when trying to change it this is when the problems started! I spoke to various different advisors (me contacting them every single time as nobody in the company seems to want to call you back. Also they have a very bad phone line and you can hardly hear or understand a word they are saying!) and not one of them knew what was happening or could tell me the same story. One advisor told me that the order needed to be cancelled and re-ordered online, another told me that I did NOT need to cancel and re-order, they would speak with the I.T team and have the issue resolved within 24 hours and then another told me that as it has taken them so long to try and sort this mess out my credit check had expired and they needed to re-run it! I refused this as I don't want lots of credit checks going against my name (especially when it is not my fault they have taken so long), so they told me I had to contact Vodafone myself (more running around and wasting time for me!) and ask for them for an account number which would help them use the first credit check. I called Vodafone and explained everything I was told and the advisor at Vodafone did not know what they was asking for and was very confused by the whole situation. I then went back to Carphone Warehouse and explained to them that Vodafone did not know what they was requesting and the advisor at C/Warehouse was very confused why they didn't understand. I did suggest instead of making me, the customer, doing all the running around maybe it would be nice if they stepped in and gave me a little help, but they didn't seem to want to. In the end, I have requested the order to be cancelled and my up front cost to be refunded to me. I have been advised, to do this I need to call them back in 72 hours with a ref number I have been provided as the order is down as invoiced! Not sure why when I haven't received anything but trouble from them. I did ask why somebody couldn't call me and they said sorry this just isn't possible, and they will be able to process the refund and then I SHOULD receive my up front cost back. I am not hopeful that the cancellation process is going to be smooth at all after the dreadful service I have received at the moment. Fingers crossed it will be the one thing they can get right for me. My advice would be avoid at all costs!"

183444,"There was nothing good about my experience whatsoever. I was never kept up to date about my laptop that was in for repair. Even when there was a delay on returning it to me, all I had was a text that the delivery was cancelled and they were working on repairing it still. I never once had a phonecall updating me. I had to call in constantly to get updates and wait in the queue for an hour each time to get useless information about my laptop. I was never given a proper update. When I did get the call to say my laptop was fixed from the engineer, I tried to ask questions about what was wrong with my laptop and he was rushing to get off the phone. Now, I have received my laptop and the lid has been scratched twice and there are dents on the back. I called and they said that there was already a scratch on the lid when they received it meaning that this will have been done in transit as my laptop has had no scratches as I look after it very well. They will collect it from me today but if this is not fixed, I will have to take it further. Poor customer service throughout."

166224,"Still waiting for a £320 refund three months after returning a faulty phone. Reading through all the negative reviews (approximately one third) you'd be forgiven for thinking that Quick Mobile Fix are intentionally and systematically defrauding customers by supplying faulty phones and then holding on to their money while delaying and frustrating any refunds. You might also guess that the further third of reviews that Quick Mobile Fix flags so that they get greyed out (you can see them if you click on the green Trustpilot star above) would contain more of the same kind of complaints.

104787,"Useless company. I went on to buy a TV pass from them. I paid and it didn't work as im not in the UK anymore. But they happily took my money. When I paid I was not in the UK, so they are happy to charge me knowing they won't provide me a service. When i tried to get a refund they said its paid for via itunes and i have to go to them with the issue. They said they can't help, even though I purchased through now TV website, which sent me to iTunes, they won't deal with it. Surely my contract is with them as I went via their site. Anyway It's a joke of a service it really is. They then told me that I must get a refund through iTunes and tried to convince me its impossible to get sent to iTunes via their website, which is not true. I literally did all of this on their app. Thought i was getting a subscription with them.

Avoid them like the plague. Awful service. They do not care about their customers"

Their customer service organisation is not responding to any of my requests. Their responses on this site are automated and created by robot scripts. Look down through their responses and you will see they are the same. They will produce an automated reply to this which will say “they are sorry to hear this and that I should contact their customer services”. Rubbish service and daylight robbery when they take my money, give me no goods and will not refund me."

Without internet for over a week and the customer service representative was rude and unhelpful. I would avoid this company at all costs."

Given we were in the middle of a lockdown I waited until July, August and despite waiting on the phone numerous times for over 45 minutes then the phone cut off. I then went into curry's who have this company branded as being part of there service!! They could not do anything to help, absolutely nothing, just told me to keep trying the number. I am out of pocket by over £150 for a service that does obviously not exist! I am appalled by the attitude and behaviour from both Team know how and also Currys. DISGUSTING ROBBERS."

Now they are saying if I do not return it within 9 days they are going to charge me £40! I cannot keep taking time off for them to ghost me. I am so incredibly glad to have left Virgin Media as they act amazingly to get you through the door but have been nothing but profiteering thieves ever since for a service that is sub par to their competitors in terms of both custormer service and deliverables.
155202,"Worst ever service. You call TKH wait 1hr on the phone, for the line to cut off. Call again, wait another 45 mins for the person to say we can’t book repairs, they will call you, you obviously don’t here back. Send email, don’t hear nothing back. 3 consecutive days calling TKH - same thing, different day. Someone on the phone at the end says we have to transfer you to a different repair company, you don’t hear back for at least a week, the random repair company call and book you in, for them to say we can’t repair it??? 3 times in a course of 6 weeks the repair came in but don’t fix it.
We now go to the Milton Keynes Curry’s, they tell us that TKH have no idea who the repair company is and they have no records????? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
TKH on the phone are the one who transferred us.
If I could do 0 I would’ve.
Be careful."
154045,"Sent me a faulty phone on a very expensive contract. Wouldn't replace it and took over 3 weeks to repair . Had to argue for a loan phone so they gave me the cheapest but of rubbish they had lying around. Got told on 2 occasions that my phone was ready to collect when infact it hadn't even been looked at by the repair centre so 2 wasted journeys into town . After this I made a complaint to head office which seems to be in south Africa. Got told they would get in touch to deal with the complaint once I recieved my phone back . 3 months later still nothing .
Over all I am very disappointed. Purchased a £1000+ phone only to recieve a faulty one with no option of replacing it , only repairing it even though it was faulty out of the box .
Will never deal with again"

186879,"Wish I checked these reviews before sending my phone for a trade in! I was offered a good amount for my phone which was barely used and was in perfect condition and perfect working order. Not a single scratch, crack or anything wrong with it. I sent off the phone and was then offered a third of what was quoted originally as it is apparently not a working device!?
I have requested Carphone to send me my phone back immediately, i’d rather keep it as a spare or take it to a different place for a trade in than basically let them take my perfect condition phone for pennies.
I’m just hoping it does get sent back to me as I have received no reply from my emails in over a week!! I will update the review once it has finally and hopefully been sent back.

Update - phone came back eventually but still no email reply to inform me that it was coming back. I took it to another mobile trade in shop and they examined the phone. My phone does NOT have screen burn as carphone have claimed. So again, definitely don’t recommend for trade in service."

162474,"The service provided by BT is atrocious to say the least! I am a very unhappy customer. We had no issues when first moving to BT from Sky as they had a deal and offered Fibre. We then moved house and was told we would have to pay the same price even though the new house was not equipped with Fibre. The speed is shocking, and we pay for the Halo package! I asked if the Halo component could be removed as it is not fit for purpose, and I was told I wasn't able to do this until I had renewed my contract. Our contract is up for renewal in January, and I can't wait to move, it has been a complete waste of money and our time when we have been ringing to speak with your advisors.

... Just been looking through the reviews and it says it all!"
149162,"Before I opened a contract with them I had full H+ signal, one month after the contract is open the H signal is fully gone and the 4g is so weak my internet is not working no more. If I want to cancel the contract they are asking for £450. It's legal robbery and I should've paid more attention.
Support was also useless and infuriating. I told them the problem above and after being told to wait 3 times the guy comes back and asks me ""Is you internet slow right now?"" What a joke of a company this is..."

So my phone was delivered the following day before 1pm and signed for as required.
At this point I'm thinking it will be a quick turn around as the pack says next day bank transfer, however what a mistake that was.
I have not had any acknowledgement that my phone has even been received. I haven't had any communication at all.
You call customer service to get told go online an disconnected.
Speak to a chat online an told it will be escalated an take 24-48 hours. I have even provided the chat assistant with my tracking number along with proof of postage.
Totally unacceptable.
I went with them as trade in value was the better price, using them in good faith, only to be bitterly disappointed. I am already regretting my decision to use them.
At present I am still waiting for a response despite numerous emails and chats.
This experience compared to other trade in sites has been awful.
I will update my review if resolved quickly.

UPDATE
All has been sorted and my payment has been made. Was a postage error. Took a little longer than I thought, however happy the outcome and the matter is resolved. Thanks"

139268,"I have used BT broadband for years and it has always been fine, solid connection and decent speeds. My problem has come recently when trying to cancel my service as I was out of contract.

I called in March to cancel and told yes will be cancelled at the end of the month and obviously I would have to pay the amount I owe - no problem.
A couple of weeks ago I receive a bill from BT. I look into my bank account and find that they have been charging me every month (my bad I guess for not cancelling the direct debit or checking my account regularly but its not my main account).

I called up and got through to someone who was very helpful and knew that I had called up to cancel previously and that it hadn't been processed. She immediately cancelled and then put me on hold whilst she went to her manager to process the refund.

After 10 minutes on hold I was transferred to someone else who had no idea why I had been transferred to them and they couldn't see anything about when I had cancelled or any bills that had been sent. I was told that there was a recording of my phone call to cancel from March on the records and that a Supervisor would listen to that and I would be called back by the same person in 7 days between 10am-12pm.

Come that day the time passes - finally I was called at 6pm and told that they couldn't verify that I had cancelled. If they had looked into data used they would see none had been used for 4 months.

This all seems quite suspicious, I wish the first person I had spoken to had stuck with it.

Turns out BT are happy to take your money but not so happy to refund it.

Please don't tell me to contact you through Facebook or Twitter as I have neither. Give me the details of someone I can speak to to get this resolved.

Thanks,"
144147,"Slow and unreliable broadband. Very bad Call Centre, possibly based in India, with awful automation and lines that drop out after long wait times.

Even after canceling, Now TV have taken an extra months payment (they said by accident) and still haven't refunded it! After 2 long calls we've been told we now have to wait another 2 weeks for the refund!

Our new broadband service (Vodafone) has a UK Call Centre, the broadband is faster, cheaper and works throughout the house! All things that Now TV couldn't do."

169295,"Avoid this company at all cost. Delivery failed to arrive when promised and when items did start to arrive they were completely wrong. Customer service was a complete joke, all we got was a promise that a ‘supervisor’ would contact us by email within the hour. We weren’t surprised when the email never arrived. We will now be contacting our credit card to facilitate a full refund. Given these were sentimental Xmas presents we will never use this company again"

119525,"I placed an order on the 9th December that never arrived and have been fobbed off for the past two weeks. Despite me complaining when the order was already one hour outside of the delivery window. On the app, it says if your order is 60 mins late you can cancel, I have the screenshot of this promise, after I placed my order… But they refused and asked me to wait 3 hours, then I’d receive a refund. But then they only repeated the same jargon to me, without an explanation as to why they wouldn’t refund me. Deliveroo is facilitating fraud and claiming plausible deniability. They continue to promote restaurants that do not deliver and they don’t even warn you that there could be a potential problem. Calling customer service is another excruciating experience. The team is based in South East Asia and are as sweet as can be, but many of them don’t know or understand consumer laws in the UK, so they give very questionable advice. I’ve reported this to my payment provider, I’m raising a case against Deliveroo with trading standards and I will report them to BBC watchdog. Unbelievably terrible customer service (or lack there of)."

So far so good normally CPW should tell the network(O2 in this case)that the item was returned and the contract should be cancelled usually within 3 to 5 days, the problem is that for some reason this has not happen, called countless times, send at least 10 emails and chatted online many times but been told that the case is been escalated to the warehouse ,but nothing has happened and now I been charged and under contract becouse they failed to cancel the contract and not doing so after almost 3 week.i am still waiting for something that should be done long ago and all they say in there email is the same broken record excuse.dont use they are useless and they get away with murder.i feel I been cheated in to in to a contract I did not want.avoid"
157334,"Update: Having left the following review, as you can see, studio responded (I suppose it looks good) However, it just took me back to before. I messaged and mentioned this review. They told me I would get a response within 7 days. Surprise surprise! I haven’t. Nothing has been done and they still haven’t chased EVRI. Therefore, unfortunately, I’m going to have to pay £45 owed on my account for trainers which I returned but I will then close my studio account and no longer shop with them. I would advise others not to shop with them also because if you need to return an item/s you may not get a refund, even though you no longer have the item/s. It’s not worth it. Shop elsewhere!

I have shopped with Ace (studio) for many years and have had no problems with items I’ve purchased until now. Unfortunately, they use EVRI as their courier.
I paid EVRI to return an item to studio on the 8th of November. Studio are saying they have not received the item and so therefore, I’ve lost £45 for the item. Plus, £3.49 paid to EVRI.
I have emailed studio a number of times and asked them to chase EVRI.
They replied at first and asked for more details which I gave them and then just sent a routine reply each time.
My request for them to chase EVRI has been ignored.
I have spent a lot of money with studio but if I cannot be refunded for any returns, then I shall close my account and shop elsewhere in future.
Terrible communications!"
103455,Fast service. Very polite staff.

I like the deals and I’m a big LP fan (one of the lucky ones that kept his collection betting on them making a comeback) HMV has an excellent collection of records and frequent deals on them. I buy a lot of CDs as well and have recently come back to HMV as the availability of titles is so much better than my last popular dealer.
No complaints here."
113353,"Worst customer service experience I have ever had!
I ordered a new Samsung Galaxy S21FE which was advertised as minimum £150 cashback when you trade in ANY smartphone in ANY condition. I checked with staff in-store at Currys in Bolton before I ordered and confirmed I would get at least £150 for my current smartphone (Sony Xperia 5 ii).
After placing the order, I called customer services (which takes approximately 40 minutes to get through), only to be told they couldn't process the trade in as my phone make and model wasn't listed. They advised I would need to visit the store to process the trade in.
On visiting the store, they advised the ANY make/ model trade in offer doesn't actually include my Sony Xperia phone and I would need to contact customer services to cancel.
Customer services have refused to cancel the order, as the new phone has already been dispatched to Currys in Bolton. They expect me to collect the phone from the store and return it to them at my own expense which I naturally refused to do.
The CS team then transferred me to the sales team and said Sales would be able to cancel the order and arrange collection of the phone (more hold time).
Sam in the sales team spoke to his 'manager' and said I needed to leave the phone without collecting it at the Bolton store and the order would be cancelled automatically after 14 days, which (conveniently), is the same length of time as the cooling off period so again I declined.
Sam then agreed he would arrange with the customer services team to have the phone collected from the Bolton store before putting me on hold. After another lengthy hold time, I was blind transferred back to the customer services team.
I then asked to speak with a manager and was put through to the sales team manager, Jason who agreed that the situation was ridiculous and promised he would speak with customer services personally to arrange the order cancellation. Again, I was placed on hold and got transferred back to the CS team, and the call was cut off - I received no call back despite them having my mobile number on file.
I called back AGAIN, spoke with an agent named Ijaz and asked to speak with the sales team manager Jason. Ijaz refused to transfer me to any manager and said he would arrange a callback which of course, I never received.
After spending several infuriating hours on the phone with these disgraceful time-wasters, I have still been unable to cancel the order and will now have to waste even more time going back into the store to return the item at my own expense.
From the other reviews on Truspilot, it appears the Carphone Warehouse business model is to advertise fake offers and then rely on a literally useless customer service team to ensure that customers are unable to cancel before the end of their 14 day cancellation period. Absolutely appalling!!"
184197,"Useless servise,uselles internet…i just lose money with BT.."
196592,"This company is operating a scam. I ordered a phone in April, was then told it would not be dispatched for 2 weeks (this is their standard policy apparently). Cancelled as I needed a phone ASAP. Promised a refund within 2 weeks (they like a 2 week timeframe it seems). 8 weeks with no refund despite chasing a huge number of times. Had to get money back via credit card company who advised this company is now on their blacklist as this happens all the time.

Wish I’d seen the articles in the Ilford Recorder or the dedicated Facebook group ‘Quick Mobile Fix Complaints and Issues’ that has more than 1.2k disgruntled and scammed customer members. Turns out they are under investigation by Trading Standards and looks like they will be closed down soon as they have continually failed to meet improvement warnings. Please do check out all these sources if you are in any doubt about using these cowboys.

More than just slightly suspicious that all the positive ‘reviews’ on here are from invited sources.

As for the negative reviews, QMF tried to get my review removed (and 1,129 other negative reviews posted by other unhappy customers) as they didn’t like what I said. I took the time to provide the detailed verification details Trustpilot requested so my review stays up, many others probably couldn’t be bothered so the review just gets removed. Trustpilot needs to address this as the overall satisfaction score does not reflect the reality.

Avoid. Avoid. Avoid! They are getting rich by sitting on all our money."

The coverage for me was great in Northamptonshire. Price was fair too. Sales were a little pushy but overall, they're a good company. As Arnie said, ""I'll be back""."

- web help says to login to do it but there's no link to request.

Never using Vodafone again"

Have tried calling back got through to an agent after 6 mins who was putting me though shortly.. 1hr 10 mins I’m still in the queue. Absolutely disgusting customer service. Over 2 hours of hold music which contains a total of 3 songs!!! Just want to cancel now and go with someone that actually has a customer service department 😡

Edit.. they have advised that you can do this in the App, however the contract I have gone with (eventually when I got through) was not available in the app, I have been a loyal customer for many years and was eligible for a 30% discount. The app doesn’t show all of the actual tariffs!!!"

174720,"Overall my buying experience was great, the ordering process was easy, the site was really helpful to identify any compatibility issues and I'm really happy with the end product. PC was delivered in perfect condition, had clearly been well built, matched the specification and came with some really useful information to help get it up and running for the first time.

The only factor preventing a 5* review was that the site gives no stock information and so it's very difficult to know the timeline for your order being completed. They do provide average delivery times and estimates of how long each stage of the process will take but I believe those stage estimates are based on averages rather than my specific order. The generic averages quoted on the site also changed considerably whilst my order was in progress so I really had no idea how long I would have to wait.

That said, the current status of my order was good and easily accessible so I knew when it was progressing but it sat in the pre-processing stage for longer than average and I had no information about why that was or how long it would be. I assume it was related to available stock of certain components which could have been communicated to alleviate the issue."

Although we had to wait almost a month, the delivery staff were friendly, efficient and polite, and the cooker has lived up to its description on the ao.com site.

145315,"Now they have the new Boost service I decided it might be interesting to try for £3 extra.

I could not find the option anywhere online regardless of the fact i was clicking on the links to get there.

I contacted their customer service and they’ve told me outright that it’s because I USED to use their internet services.

So it turns out if you used to use their internet services or even if you currently do you cannot have their boost service...they are actually punishing current customers...I was in shock...they just told me to start a new account with a different email address and pay more for the passes than the deal I currently have, in turn meaning that I would be paying more money for the upgrade than other customers. This is unbelievable.

I have made a formal complaint and will be going to trading standards as this is absolutely outrageous."

146863,"I received my Samsung Galaxy a71 on the 01/03/2020 after 3 weeks the phone began to crash and turn off randomly so I contacted the Carphone warehouse and was put through to the sales team who told me that the customer support was closed and they they're unable to help with general enquires so I waited a few more days and tried to contact again and was told the same thing so I waited a few weeks, 5 to be exact, and they told me that because it was over 30 days old I could not get a refund or replacement and the repairs team was closed due to the current circumstances with COVID-19 So I could not get a repair either so I waited for the stores to open which was today (15/16/2020) nearly 3 months since the faults began. When I went to the store they were happy to refund me until they saw that I had previously contacted the Carphone warehouse and then they told me that the amount for the device cannot be refunded due to me previously contacting them but I can get a repair so I unhappily agreed as I felt pressured to do so. Later that day I contacted customer service once more to ask why the store could not refund me because I had contacted them previously on the phone and I was told that it was because it is older than 30 days old so I replied ""that didn't answer my question"" and I was told to f*** off and then they hung up, If anyone from Carphone warehouse reads this I hope that you understand the type of company you work for and that something can be done about this as I do not want to deal with this company anymore and after being sworn at I don't feel that the repair is an adequate option and would like to request a refund once again and never have to deal with this company again."
182482,"Shocking customer service.
Have you ever tried to speak to a person at Vodafone? There are So many hurdles to jump through it’s unbelievable! Now, finding the information you need off their website is like finding a needle in a haystack, either it’s evasive or buried in soooo much text you need hours and hours to sift through it. SIMPLIFY THE INFORMATION!! You’ve managed it on your VOXI SITE.
PLUS, charge everyone £0.50 more for their contract and give EVERYONE back EU roaming. You are giving everyone an itch to scratch. It’s irritating to go back decades and have to buy ‘bolt ons’ in order to use your UK allowance in the EU. Please don’t use the Brexit excuse, that’s well worn now. If o2 can do it so can you. Get a grip pan give the marketing people a kick and tell them to stop being plonkers. People will walk because of this. It’s easier to keep existing customers than to try and lure them from rival networks. Basic business strategy. Do you even have a strategy?"

111422,"Non existent customer service. Faulty cooker delivered and due to some very tight time constraints, (long story)I went and brought a replacement so that my electrician could wire it in and get us going straight away. I thought, no problem I'll sort the return & refund tomorrow. Several places on their website & their T&C's said I could return to a store. As I had literally nowhere to store this item while awaiting a lengthy collection process, I put in in the car and took it to my local store. The manager was really unhelpful said I couldn't return to store. So I left it with them anyway as I couldn't take it back. Then the lengthy saga of trying to contact customer service to explain where it was and for it to be uplifted. Their email address is no longer in service. The phone service after a lengthy wait said they couldn't help, neither could the online chat service. No one there will give you an email address to put your complaint in writing. They were happy to take my money and all is probably OK if you don't run into any problems.
So the faulty cooker is now in your Stratford upon Avon store awaiting Currys to process my refund, which I've been told I won't get. So all I have left is a letter before action followed by a Small Claims through the court system. I have used Currys many, many times before and never have has such poor service."

144268,"Having been with BT for a few years a cheaper option came along and I left BT, but I carried on using my bt Internet address not thinking a lot about it, 4 years in-fact!
As we all do I had so many companies and friends and family contacting me via this address, then two weeks ago my emails stopped, I contacted BT who I thought were very helpful seeing I wasn’t now a paying customer, they informed me that the email address I was using was “live” and they would try and resolve the problem, what a great company I thought!
However the guy on the phone told me he would have to pass the problem to another division as he couldn’t sort it, and told me they would contact me within 72 hours, no contact was made so I called BT again, once again went through it all with them only to be told my email address was now non existent! Can I retrieve my emails or reinstate the address I asked, no, was the answer, I offered payment but was told the address was gone forever! Don’t they let people know they are deleting their email, Without giving then a chance to either make payment to keep it, or to make other arrangements!
BT stinks I’m glad I left and will tell as many as I can to stay away from them."

134523,"I don't use BT for my landline or internet as they are too expensive. Moved to Sky and then TalkTalk and cut my bills in HALF. But, unfortunately I have to use the line as BT control the line and rent it to other providers. I have constant problems with the line and changed the handset twice both of which were made in China and each one is hopeless. Both failed on the 13th month (how convenient) Crackles and now I can't dial 1471 to see who called. Have always detested BT the bigger the company the more arrogant they are and give the worst possible service and they don't give a sh**

With 89% of customers voting BAD it endorses my comments. What also annoys me is the CEO of these giant corporations earn 7 figure salaries and do NOTHING to improve the service they provide. I wonder how many salaries that is equal to from the people on this site making the complaints? It is shocking."

174360,"Interesting that Virgin Media replied to my first review. Quicker to get a response here than from customer services. The response stated ""we're(Virgin media) not immune from inflation and we are seeing rising costs across the business"".

Nobody is immune from inflation but the enforced price rises, above inflation, will affect customers adversely.

To recap VM are implementing price rises of retail price index(R.P.I.) + 5.9% every year. The R.P.I. is NOT considered an official inflation rate by the Government. They use Consumer price index(C.P.I.). BT, EE and most other companies use the CPI as a basis. CPI is currently 10.5%, whilst RPI is 13.4%

Both measures attempt to measure the effect of prices on a typical household and do NOT reflect the effect of inflation on VM's costs.

On top of the inflated inflation rate VM are adding 3.9% and will be doing this EVERY year.

If VM choose to reply to this review then please justify:
1. Why use RPI
2. Why increase this by 3.9%
3. Why insist on this every year.

Anyone negotiating a new contract or becoming a new contract should also insist on responses to the 3 questions"
104438,"Placed an order over Christmas, and was dispatched for delivery through Evri. For a TV unit. Attempted delivery 3 times between 30.12 and today (04.01.23) ....well that's what the tracking says. Tried to highlight my concerns to studio after 2nd failed attempt to no avail. So after 3rd attempt its now being returned to studio. However, the courier has never actually tried to deliver. Having been in the house on each attempt AND with CCTV I have evidence there was no attempt. Unfortunately I'm now left with a quandary courtesy of Studio.

I have the matching side tables so do I now need to return them? Or, do I reorder the tv unit, but then what's the likely hood of the same thing happening? And having paid delivery why should I get it delivered to family 12 miles away in the hope they get it and face 24 miles round trip?

Unfortunately Studio, as you use the least reliable courier of all, you are getting 1 star as your contracted courier has lied and deceived the tracking just to save delivering."

123378,"Where do I begin? Went into the store to buy a cooker on Dec. 28th and was sold a built-in, instead of a free-standing cooker - it was in a box therefore we didn't notice until it was delivered. However, this was just the start of the shambles. When we went back to the store to get a new one and when we tried to pay for it the payment came out of my account but was declined and wasn't taken at your end. The sales assistant said it must be a problem with my bank but when I went to the bank it was clear that the bank had released the funds but Currys hadn't taken it. The payment was pending for 5 days and I couldn't get access to my money, nor did I have a cooker !! I eventually got my cooker after 2 1/2 weeks !! I have a child at home and I was unable to properly feed her for over two weeks because of a fault not of my own but of your company's. Not only this, but I was offered nothing in way of recompense ie free delivery or a small discount which i think would have been entirely fair. I have to say I was very disappointed with this experience and would be very reluctant to shop with your company again."

177101,"Day 1: The operative failed to turn up on the appointed day and did not call to inform us.
Day 2: The operative arrived the next day (following a complaint to the head office) but did not have the correct tools with him so could not carry out the installation.
Day 3: The same 'rogue' operative attended to carry out the installation but his work was extremely shoddy, he did not use any dust sheets and damaged the decorations in my hallway. He left trailing cables both internally and externally which severely compromised the system and left it vulnerable to tampering.
Day 4: We complained to the installers head office the staff were polite, courteous and apologetic. They dispatched two more operatives who corrected the poor workmanship carried out by the first operative and in fairness did a very good job.
In conclusion I had to take 4 days off work which effectively has cost me in excess of £700. The decorations in my hallway will have to be made good by others. It was a truly terrible experience and would advise the installation company to dismiss the first operative as he is a complete liability and has absolutely no respect for the customer's property."

Now TV are trying to say that I subscribed to these channels, which FALSE.
Its dishonest and should be reported to the relevant watchdog, which I intend to do without delay.

Here is my last letter to the crooks @ NOW TV IRL:
you TOTALLY ignore the fact that I ONLY requested the 14 day trial of ""Entertainment"", the other packages YOU added NOT I.
This is blatantly fraudulent behaviour on your part and should form NO part of any reputable companies commercial practice.
You billed me without my consent €43, I demand a refund in full. dishonest behaviour should NOT be rewarded.
It goes without saying that the programmes you fraudulently charged to my credit card were NOT ordered, are NOT wanted, and should be cancelled forthwith.
I expect you to do the honest thing and refund me in full for the overcharge.

I expected better from Vodafone especially after being with them for 6 years and each year I was upgrading to a new phone.
122173,"1 star is too much. I've been with BT for many years and encountered many problems. Why i'm still with them? I dont know to be honest. From what I understand all these suppliers are as bad as one another. And ultimately BT own all the lines anyway. Still, I should have left years ago.
My story is so long winded there isn't even enough character space here to list every issue i've had with customer services and the general service quality of their internet over the years. I had typed it out and run out of space to finish.
In short, I had some disconnection issues most saturdays (my peak use times) between 10am-3pm AFTER my contract ended in Dec 21. Not one time in contract over the 24 months did it happen. Coincidence? You decide. Apparently they narrowed the fault to the hub after an engineer tested the line into the property. Problem persists so I contact BT again. They suggest replacing the hub or enter a new deal which will replace the hub anyway and fix the fault. No good enough deals offered so I leave it and look at other suppliers offering the same service for almost half what i'm paying BT. Later did some haggling and agreed a deal (after being told im on their best price previously, it's all lies) substantially cheaper per month with the same speeds. All of a sudden all my fault cases in My BT section had been resolved/closed by customer services stating that I had told them it was fixed. No I didn't. Why would I tell BT its been fixed while i'm sitting looking at my hub light up like a xmas tree turning itself on and off, disconnecting me from internet use? I'm still clueless as to what the actual problem is but yet the issues have disappeared since I agreed to a new deal? Was there an issue or was it because they wanted me in a new deal? Again, make up your own mind. Anyway, my new deal started today and no new hub has arrived so I contact customer service to see when I can expect to see it, only to be told no hub is being sent with your new deal. Excuse me? That was PART of my deal! Part of fixing the fault I have. But no fault, no hub required right? Miraculously, My OLD hub now has no issues since I agreed to a new deal. How convenient! Is it a coincidence? Again, i'll leave that for you to decide. I was told an engineer was visiting the exchange and an agent booked an appointment for that. As soon as my new deal was agreed that appointment was cancelled and when I queried it, I was blamed for cancelling it. Why would I cancel and engineer going to the exchange while the fault still existed? Here is another for you. On live chat I was informed my complaint case had been closed also. Who closed it? BT. Nothing has been resolved, nobody has been in contact with me even though I was sent an email stating someone would be in contact within 48 hours. 4 days on, nothing. This same advisor encouraged me to be passed to her manager. I had run out of time to chat and asked if someone could call me to which I was told - we will only be able to call you if you speak to my manager. That to me sounded like blackmail. Absolute rubbish. If it can be done after I speak with them on live chat, it can be done before. I cannot believe I was expected to believe this nonsense. All lies. I feel so stupid having put the slightest trust in BT to begin with as I was 75% out the door to another supplier before I was offered their best deal. Further to that, I always request the transcript for these live chats are sent to me, i've never received 1. Something to hide BT? Promising the world and not delivering so hide the evidence? Its ok, I've taken screen shots of everything your lying agents said when signing me up to a new deal. Especially about a new hub. It was a promise!!! (Their exact words) hahaha how i've been fooled. Shows not to trust any of their customer service agents. I wish I could post the screenshot here for everyone to see.

IF YOU ARE FROM BT READING THIS, do not even bother to tell me to get in touch with your team on social media as you've done with others, I can't get any sense from people who are in customer service as it is. You want this resolved, you contact me. Preferably someone with a track record of honesty. This is your problem being made to be mine. I've been chasing you lot around for weeks and got absolutely nowhere other than to be lied to. You really think i'm going to chase you anymore? Absolutely not. If I dont have my hub within this week, i'll be taking advantage of my 14 day cooling off period and cancelling the order. Never in my life as a consumer have I been tempted to go seek consumer advice. I'd really be interested to gather more information to backup my case here. Empty promises, lies, manipulation, greed. What more reason do you need to stay away from BT. 88% 1 star reviews out of 10500 people tells me enough. Then there are the disgruntled people who didn't leave a review. Overall, I think the company is a mess."
198228,I have been purchasing RAM for quite a few years now and predominately it has been Crucial that has taken the lion's share of the orders. I will be rethinking this as Mr Memory provided an excellent and swift service which had a client's laptop in much better shape in about 48 hours.

101082,"I've been a BT customer for 6 years. When I called up to cancel my services because I found a cheaper deal elsewhere, I was first put into contact with a lady who used this as an opportunity to sell me a new contract. While I appreciate sales, she gave me a price which I asked her to hold for 24hrs when before I knew it, I had new paperwork for a new contract for 24 months delivered via email.

When the following day I tried to exercise my cooling off period for a contract I never agreed to. Upon doing this, I was informed that my contract couldn't be cancelled and I'd need to set something up with another supplier who will then take up the line. He first walked me through why BT is better though, which is fine, I get thats their job, but he started talking about how long it would take an engineer visit to come to us and he cited 2 days, but the last time I had an issue - in October this year, it took 18 days for an engineer to visit.

From this, the representative then got very angry and started shouting down the phone about how I was lying and if I wanted the truth, I could just google it - completely disregarding my own experience.

I'm so disappointed that this is how my custom with BT ends, but I will not be going out of my way to use them again."
152186,"Ordering was very simple, but that’s where it ended. Washing machine due on the Sunday, removed old appliance, late Sunday afternoon, delivery people call. Turn up, no washing machine loaded. Guys were great. Just rescheduled for the following week, had a voicemail to confirm, got through, eventually and spoke to a lady who obviously hated her job and a was as useful as a comedian at a funeral. So if there’s this many problems before the item arrives, God only knows what would happen afterwards. So cancelled before it got any worse."

129029,"Website easy to use, Delivered very quickly.
Impressed"
129055,I ordered on Aug 31st. After 10 days I wrote and asked how long it would take. They said I would have to wait my turn in the long queue. I wrote twice to customer services but they kept giving me excuses. On Monday 27th they said that my PC was being assembled and on Thursday 30th it was delivered. I ordered a special graphics card but they could not be bothered to send me any info on it plus the PC came with a load of bits that were not fitted to the PC. If you must order from these people be prepared for a long wait. Their customer services are machine driven.
160218,"In respect of a recent necessary service cessation, I was dismayed to have been charged over £200 and to have experienced BT’s indifference to my association with the company – an unbroken association spanning several decades.

I telephoned BT on Friday 14th October 2022 around 9 a.m. to say my relative’s flat in Cumbria was being sold and I wanted to end the telephone contract there (for which I was responsible) as soon as possible, as no-one was living there now, and someone else soon would be. The BT agent I spoke to responded by saying I was terminating my 24-month contract early for which a charge of about £220 would be made.

I remonstrated with the agent that people could not be expected to live in a place for an exact multiple of two years in order to suit BT, and I had already been responsible for the line for several years (though technically there had been a “renewal” in Summer 2021). I reminded him that I was also a customer of BT elsewhere, having a line to my house in Scotland, so I wasn’t forsaking the company. Indeed, as I further reminded him, I had been a BT customer for many, many years. None of these arguments seemed to make much headway, though he did say he would consult a supervisor. Putting me on hold he returned to the phone a little later to tell me the supervisor confirmed what I had already been told, though as a concession BT would remit one month’s direct debit payment in respect of my line in Scotland.

Subsequently:-
I received an e-mail indicating that I had ordered a cessation from 14th November. (I don’t recall ordering any such distant date.)
I telephoned BT on the evening of 20th October about 5.30 p.m. (20 minutes wait for an answer) to say that I was already removed from the flat and could they please cease their service immediately? The lady responded by agreeing a cessation the following day, 21st October.
Late on 21st October, one of those “Don’t reply to this” e-mails arrived from BT to say there was a change to the order and the cessation would in fact be 14th November.
More than three weeks after my original call, on 8th November, BT took a further £44 monthly direct debit for the Cumbria line; this was three weeks after a new owner had moved in!
Only quite recently have I received my final bill for the line from BT, showing a cessation date of 18th November (not 14th as their e-mails had indicated) and calculating a final net “payment due” of £203, which money they have now taken. So, since my original call, a total of over £247 has been taken from my account for the Cumbria line.
I have not received the indicated one-month’s remission from BT in respect of my continuing Scotland line; indeed, BT have just e-mailed to say they are about to take a further direct-debit for that.

In September 2023, this remaining BT line, which by then I will have held for nearly ten years, will reach the end of an exact 24-month period. At that time, I would hope to cease my foolish brand loyalty and find some other broadband provider. There are several – and some will surely show me better standards of customer care and loyalty than I have experienced with BT?"

I find it easy to curl with them as well because of their shape."
175505,Had my very account for a number of years the interest rate was high I shopped and paid my payments on time my credit as increased but my interest rate as stayed high very confusing as I have never defaulted
162000,"Worst customer service ever. Was phoned and offered a deal which I took, only to look on their website to see a better deal. Then started what can only be described as an ordeal to try and get the the first deal cancelled. A number of phone calls to customer service where I was passed around and told different things each time. Asked to speak to a manager on many occasions but apparently they are always in a meeting."
135195,"Phones arrived quickly, looking almost as good as new and seem to work perfectly. A great service!"
138525,"WEX are my go to supplier for camera gear. Always great stock, in the case of used gear, described just as it should be to reflect its condition. Ordering is simple, delivery quick and after sales superb! Keep it up guys! Great experience"
175065,"I wanted to purchase some quality used items for my children. I bought two Iphone X phones and an Ipad. All the items were excellent and the battery life is superb. As result of the extremely low purchase prices I was able to get phones and an Ipad with 256Gb memory.

The ordering was secure and the items arrived promptly. We have had them now for eight months with no issues at all. It is good to know that they came with a 1 year guarantee.

I will definitely be using Quick Mobile fix again. It is so much safer than buying a random item from individuals online.

It has proved very easy to get contemporary technology, in excellent condition, unlocked at a fantastic price."
159517,"A third of the cost of a genuine part and fits perfectly.
company quick to deal with my request and sent of promptly. All good"
112010,"Booked a fridge delivery for an available date.. Kept getting texts reminding me and making sure someone would be at home... We sold our old fridge the night before and put the entire fridge contents in buckets and ice boxes outside. We waited all day and got a message from Curry's at 4.30 in the evening to tell us that our fridge would be delivered on a date 2 days later... No apology or reason. Poor service, stacks of ruined food... Not happy"
148821,"The process of choosing the components was very straightforward. I was kept up to date with all stages of the computers construction and delivery.
I’m more than happy with product and with the service from PC Specialist."

184302,"So quick and easy, I always use Music Magpie to sell my old mobile phones"
189504,"This company is disgusting. First called them on 29th December, now 18th January with broken washing machine. Happy to take my money for the care plan. What care plan? Cannot call them, takes five minutes to be told no one is available. Cannot book online not recognising my CORRECT details. Engineers arrive ten days after initial call with no parts or wrong parts to fix. I would advise using a local repair service and steer clear of these clowns."

139825,"Thanks for an amazing service. Got referred to you by a friend. Ordered on Saturday evening (After consulting with Tayna Batteries on WhatApp after-hours on a Saturday evening sending photos and measurements, they advised me which battery to get) and delivered at 08:30 Monday morning and I installed quickly myself. All at half price and a day quicker than the local companies could get stock... 👊👍
Absolutely incredible!"

170260,"Was assisted by Faris H, a very helpful individual. Obviously knew what he as going and has hopefully sorted my problem by arranging a new smart meter to be installed."
185246,Excellent service. Delivered on time - the only company to be able to supply before Christmas. Good price; good tracking.
130468,"Service great! I ordered 2HP ink cartridges at teatime and received them the following morning. I didn't pay for next day delivery either, so was expecting to wait a few days. Couldn't believe it!"

Shocking companyoffered 500 had my phone 6 days then tried to say it was faulty because it had a couple of light scratches so offered 170 asked to send my phone back told it would be 3-5 days then hung up on me … I will be contacting trading standards as they are just scamming people offering an amount then give you next to nothing for it never again

150110,Dejan k was very helpful and understanding very pleasant talking to him
141813,"The model of no contract and the amount of shows and films is very good. However, they recently changed their platforms and it's absolutely awful now.
First of all, they make you download a player to watch on your laptop and that doesn't work with casting to Apple TV or Chromecast, so you necessarily need to download it on your phone and tablet.
Then, on your mobile or tablet, you see the Casting button but it just doesn't work - or at least you need to try multiple times until it does.
Now, contacting their online chat, the representative spent more time trying to sell me memberships and Boost than trying to help me, then they told me that you can't use Chromecast without a Boost (which obviously costs extra) because ""you can't watch in 2 devices at the same time"" and for Now, using a Chromecast will be detected as watching in 2 devices simultaneously even though that's not the case - so you either pay extra or you can't watch it on your TV if it doesn't support their native app.
And even though we are paying for it, now they have ads, unless, again, you get Boost. So they are just really pushing everything to pay extra after years of working in a different way."
136757,"This company is the worst most dishonest people I have come across in business, I am not sure what their excuses will be once Covid restrictions are gone, they seem to blame everything on Covid, I even think their bank had Covid 19 as it could not refund money several months!! The product order rarely arrives and the bank is just too ill to refund your money, please do not trust this company with your very hard earned cash, you will be left very disappointed"
126284,My order was quick and easy to collect and it was exactly what I wanted
102931,"Food never arrived, they listed it as delivered & said, “nothing we can do”, no refund & no food. Absolutely unacceptable, horrendous service"
164092,"Excellent customer service, updated every step of the way during build, test and delivery."
138858,I love this site a great choice of music and dvds. It's so easy to order and pay with card and I just love music magpie I've been replacing some long lost music CDs it's great to hear some great music again and the prices are so good too
110406,"I ordered a 4 piece bedroom set from Studio a few weeks ago. Today it was finally delivered and I was supplied with different coloured bed side cabinets to the rest of the set (ordered blue and received cream). This was already a disappointment as the items were ordered as a set and not individually!

When I called the customer service team, I was shocked with the treatment I received. After I had explained my issue, the employees response was 'so what's your problem?'. He was implying that there was not a problem with receiving different coloured items! This is highly infuriating and studio would take no responsibility for their mistake. Now sitting in my house is a wardrobe set that I am unable to use or build until they decide what to do. Very disappointing from Studio. I will not be ordering again."
108220,"I could not fault PC specialist from start to finish, they informed me at every stage, of the build, of my laptop.
The delivery was on time, it was very well packaged
I have already recommended them to my family and friends, very happy I chose this company."
114057,"I originally received BT Sport through the Sky TV platform. Due to the expense, I switched TV & Broadband to BT. BT arranged the transfer from Sky but did not stop the BT Sport on the Sky platform despite this transfer. They kept billing by DD but I didn’t see it. After 4 years I got my 1st bill by email for the BT Sport on Sky whilst at the same time getting 2 bills (rather than 1 previously) for BT Sport on the BT TV platform - 2s apart. Some sort of email server problem? So despite not receiving BT Sport on the Sky platform & paying (and receiving) BT Sport on the BT TV platform, I have still been charged for the Sky platform for 4 years. And BT have refused to refund! What a rip off!!!
Yes I did mention it to BT when complaining but they either didn’t believe me or just decided it was irrelevant. I asked them to explain why I suddenly started receiving 2 bills for BT TV platform at the same time as starting to receive them for Sky platform but they just insisted that they had sent the bills and it wasn’t an issue on their side."
148908,"The product is finished to a very high quality which I'm very pleased with. However, I was able to get a 65% off code to make my 20 small cards and envelopes a very reasonable £30 approximately. My first quote was £85 which seems very expensive, I think the prices are inflated to make people feel they're getting a good deal, and I really feel for those people that forget or don't realise they could enter the code for a reduced price, such as my parents, and pay an over inflated price."
154613,"A disgrace too UK business I have been with them 14yrs got partial fiber upgrade after a 2yr wait then it goes wrong after numerous complaints about my poor service dropping at least 5too15 times per day they sent out wrong people at least 8times at the same time charging me full price of £49per month asking for a rebate no they said finally now going too Vodafone at £22per month might have same problems but at over half the cost and then BT phoned me saying they can match there price I told them no bt
are a joke and don't want anymore contact please stay away from them please please please"

146269,"Absolutely amazing
Communication awesome
Would seriously highly recommend"
189665,"Following on from my previous review and advice from Karl at TalkTalk to call the loyalty team, I made time to do that today and thus far is pleased with the outcome. The call takes some time to go through checks and agreements etc but I've managed to get a deal from £36 to £28 monthly - starting from 27 September when the necessary works are carried out. This will help me to budget for the next 24-months and now I know the process I hope to better manage my bills & quality of service in the future. I am not a heavy user and so someone else might pay more depending on their individual packages. Fingers crossed that all runs smoothly from 27 September onwards."
169355,"Engineer very helpful. Decision made quickly and replacement ordered before the end of the day, fantastic service"
157399,Order never arrived and there was no communication
126227,"I ordered an iPhone, which said on the website that it will be delivered on October 26th, which was 2 days later. I received an email stating that we are unable to deliver at this time due to a stock shortage and now it will take one month. They charged my credit card quickly. False advertising I'm now on the phone with them and have been waiting for 2 hours for them to resolve this."
159705,Prompt service. Goods as described.
189117,Always a Good service lovely prints and mouse mat. Very pleased with them.
184819,"I have been trying to get my washing machine fixed for a month now had 2 engineers in last 4 weeks had to wait 2 weeks for a part and then wait for an appointment to come and fit and now it's still not working
And got to wait 10 more days for another engineer to come out
I'm. Not happy has you can imagine!!!!!!!"
133984,"So far Music Magpie has not lived up to my expectations after reading the information on their website.
I ordered an iPhone 12 Pro Max as a Christmas present and when it arrived it was grubby around the camera lenses and various other places which led me to believe that it had not been through their process of checks and cleaning.
It was quite hard to contact them to register this fact and even after messaging them their communication was minimal. The phone has not been used yet as it’s a gift so I can not comment further at this stage.
Just a bit disappointed at this stage."
158544,"Fantastic value for the price,the extras that allow u to clean cars,but also have extensions reaching high places ie ceilings. Bought vacuum before worth every penny,would buy from G.Tech every time."
122202,I ordered some plastic edging for glass shelves and a Salad Crisper for my Beko fridge. They all arrived in tip top condition and I have since ‘installed’ them in my fridge. Make sure that you use the fridge model finder part of the website as this meant I got the right parts.
111566,"I’ve used Mazuma to sell my old phones a few times over the years. Always a good service, and competitive buy back price."
174755,Ordered late afternoon and arrived next day . Marvellous. Phone excellent condition
183225,Great service quick delivery easy to use website
129124,"Tried to get fibrecity broadband via Vodaphone. Both are useless and unhelpful. They really do not care and I
think the 87% bad reviews says it all. Steer clear and hopefully they will either change management or go bankrupt and be replaced by someone who gives a damn."
160144,"Easy to book the service appointment.
Appointment within 7 days.
Regular updates via text and email.
Just 2hr window to wait, engineer arrive well within and completed the service in no time."
105277,"I have used Mazuma over the past few years but have recently been getting bad vibes from other people suggesting Mazuma keeps marking down quoted prices. This happened to me twice this week for items that didn't have scratches. Although they offer to return the items it is quite likely they know people will not bother. Sadly I will not be using them again. Really disappointed of my treatment after being one of their customers for several years. I know people who regularly upgrade phones I will now be telling them to use another service.

In fairness I will update my review. After making a complaint my offer for the phone was increased somewhat but not the original offer. I have still accepted the revised offer as its just not worth the hassle of having it sent back and then sending to another purchaser.

Going through the reviews this appears to be a regular coincidence of marking down phones and watches. I will in future use another service."
166172,"I needed a replacement drive belt for the floor sweeping head of my GTech Pro sweeper, but was disappointed to find that the item was not available to order from the website. I phoned GTech and the agent I spoke to told me that they were not available as it was not intended for customers to change the belt. The phone line was incredibly bad, I could not hear a lot of what the agent was saying, and in the end, it cut off on its own. I phoned back and spoke to a different agent, who confirmed that the item was in fact available to purchase. I phoned through to sales and an incredibly helpful and good-natured lady took my order and payment, and the item arrived the next day. Overall, I'm very satisfied, and am only deducting one star because the item wasn't available to purchase online, and the first agent wrongly told me that they were not available at all."
113806,"Process was easy to follow and having the three options for the phone condition was perfect to allow a sensible choice of condition.
The service speed was good and communications clear.."
157638,The website was easy to use and we easily found the part we required. Once ordered it arrived on time.
182422,Studio are always great good prices and very helpful the only downside is being out of stock
158408,This is the second time I have used Tayna batteries. I have been very pleased with the products and services on each occasion. Their prices are excellent and you get a speedy fast delivery via tracked service as well.

Contact with sellers was fast kind, ease to understand."
193973,"Disgusting customer service!
I was due to have my wifi installed on the 16th of December 2022. I took the day off and half way through the day they said they where not coming out- could not explain why just that the engineer was not coming. Then got given the date of 5th of Jan so had no wifi for nearly a whole month. Booked the whole day off for the wi-fi to be installed. Went in fine got home last night the wi-fi was not working. I phoned BT and they said an engineer would have to come out and fix it. I said that I will not be booking another day off so they will have to come out at the weekend. They said my area was available at the weekends which they NEVER mentioned when I looked at buying internet with them. I said I will have to look at another provider for internet then and they said I would be charged a coming out of contract charge even though they are the ones who have failed the contract not me. I am currently seeking legal advice and waiting to hear back from BT but I would never recommend them ever!"
119921,"HMV always are the best company for everything you need. Entertainment is totally their number one.

137788,"Very reasonable price, original part and fast delivery !!"
170181,Easy to identify part required . Arrived quickly and easy to fit. Given my old dyson hoover a new lease of life for realistic price
186018,Avoid. Money taken from my account over a month ago (£400) and still no sign of phone even though 7-10 days was the initial promise. Allowed more time due to current COVID climate but now consistently being given the same crappy excuses “it’s still in testing please allow time frame to take place. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
191556,Being disabled I was very well looked after and made comfortable while I waited for my product. Great customer service.
184369,I can’t say enough about PC Specialist. I do t know much about computers but I had to upgrade my system for work. I emailed them some questions and they were so helpful about making sure I had what I needed. The new PC is worlds ahead of what I used to have (and it’s so pretty!) They kept me up to date through every step of the process and I can’t recommend them enough
142215,The service was excellent. The product arrived a little earlier than promised which was good. It was exactly as described and the packaging was in good condition. No problems at all.
139434,Offered free gift that wasn’t free or at least if it was it was inaccessible will happily change this review if Snapfish rectify this
188778,"Really good battery, Landy starts better than ever. Arrived really quickly and was a good price."
149379,"Estelle was amazing at explaining everything and finding me a great deal for Internet, TV & Phone package. Thank you for making it so easy."

181563,"Love the online experience, stock checked is super handy n not to mention that the staff at the Bromley store is fabulous! It's exceeded my expectations and will revisit again!"
174763,"Will never use again. The order wasn't delivered as the driver couldn't find our address. However, the app said it had been delivered. Thieves."
175181,Used several times and always easy reliable service. Thanks
120516,"What a joke.
Called for a PAC code about 10 times & complained in writing.
Still no PAC code, they don't let you leave their rubbish service, they just leave you on hold for hours."
126514,"Great service, great communication. No problem whatsoever."
130721,"I am writing again about PartsCentre because in the end the spare part I had ordered was finally delivered yesterday afternoon.
Royal Mail again was the one not doing their job properly, and all along PartsCentre were truthful in their statements.
I only want to apologise for not believing them and being to quick to moan about them."

184001,"What a fiasco!
They installed fttp and speed is now lower than copper system and BT cannot sort it. 4 engineers and 3 different home hubs. Today a new engineer came and said he cannot work on fttp and BT say if I want another engineer I must pay!! They escalated my complaint a week ago and booked a managers call last Monday between 1-3pm and guess what they didn't call. Customer service is a complete joke - no wonder they have a very low rating."
171127,"I actually can't believe what BT have just told me. I reported a fault with them on 10th July 2020. Internet dropping and slow connection when it worked. The replaced most of the line apart from a connection at the top of a pole that was condemned in 2019. They have just told me that they can't get to the pole because of the undergrowth and it is the customers responsibility to get it cleared. WT f, its not my pole, its 500m from my house in the middle of a field that I don't own.. AAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHH !!! how many more years before we get this sorted. open reach are just as bad!"
128025,Always a pleasure ordering from Snapfish!
188915,"From viewing the item on your website, and to ordering and delivery, the experience was excellent. YOu were even better than you know who. You gave a delivery window, and you were well inside it. Thanks."
137049,"Absolutely terrible and extremely fed up with the vodafone app. Everytime I get a bill and its higher than normal I go onto the app to check what it was that put it up, well guess what it crashes on me. Strange? I think not !
I go to go on app today, guess what it's having technical difficulties 🤬.
Over 3 years ago I.kept ringing in every month looking for a paper bill sent out , next month a paper bill would come. Then next month back to notification to say bill was ready to view on my vodafone app.. Well I'm sure u can guess how that went when I went to check it ........"

172726,"My phone was stolen over a week ago, I need documents for my insurance to make a claim, the customer service tells me every day it will be done within an hour. I haven't received anything, spoke to 7 people(have screenshot) and still nothing, I'm stuck abroad with no phone, fighting every day for simple document to be sent. I send emails, no reply. They ruined my holidays."
151174,Good camera. Some scratches to rear screen which I didn't expect but it's a used body so I suppose it is par for the course

195577,Great website and the pc I’d purchased is working excellently. You guys had been recommended to me by a friend and so I bought my pc from you. After purchasing my pc I recommended to my friend who was looking for a pc to purchase his from you guys as well. :)
141986,Shipment lost in transit and the agent was apologetic and immediately reordered replacements for free
141128,"If you have a choice keep away, far away..... far far away! Staff are lying to get better sales, the network is absolute rubbish (no signal in central London or in london in general), the website is outdated and disfunctional. Not going to renew with them on one of my contracts and once my other one expires I'm taking my custom and running away with it.... far far away!"
132249,"Excellent service
First class products"
122817,Aaron F is a legend! After having a few negative experiences Aaron went above and beyond in trying to get myself sorted and it wasn’t straightforward to say the least but he wouldn’t stop until he got the issue resolved which is so refreshing and he genuinely wanted to get me sorted.
109774,"The only company trading as mobile phone shop, that doesn't have any mobile phones in store, all I wanted was to buy a sim free mobile phone, the transaction should have taken no more than 5 mins after I had confirmed my phone of choice, I was on a break from work told that didn't have any of the 3 phones I wanted in stock at store and so chose the only phone that was out of desperation, then to go through the hard sell of them to flog me insurance that I didn't want and told them straight, so after 20 mins then to go to complete the transaction and then none of the card machines would would work - then 15 minutes later after much rebooting of tills and card machines still the same issue 40 minutes wasted and no phone, they wouldn't even use the working card machines in the Currys store it was based in ( you are the same company) drove to another store to get another phone, and I was told that they wouldn't see me by rude staff as probably they wouldn't get time to serve me as had 2 people Infront of me and were closing in 90 mins time, castle vale and Tamworth stores are terrible - no phones and poor customer service - not using you ever again ordered online with another company got the phone I wanted next day and saved £65"

Surprise! The order was not there
The manager said she will order again but for delivery.
Actually she ordered another item for collection at Argos Stevenage.
I have noticed that too late when I received a message.
But that's not all ,a few minutes later I have received an email saying I have collected my order!
I have tried to contact someone from Argos but mission impossible.So I have lost 32£ for nothing."

Still not arrived ... very poor and now a missed Christmas gift. Will look at other printers in the future."
119102,"This was ordered for my friend's funeral. The choice of card was made from a very good suggested list. The cards arrived one day after the order was placed and were of a very high quality in terms of grade of card and printed design. I would recommend this business without hesitation, Good job done."
125161,Delivery was fast and secure. I find the headphones really comfortable and excellent quality - clean but with the full range. I personally find listening to music with these headphones really immersive.
195366,"Good service, easy to use, easy to order. Was a bit concerned when I was sent a preview of what had been sent to me, with heads cut off the cards.
In my orders to be continued (that appeared as though I was in the middle of ordering) it was perfect, so I thought they sent the wrong ones.
Turned out they sent tge right ones though, so all good.

Delivery was late, due to postal strike, so can't comment on that. Overall though, would use again."
133002,"A year ago this week I had virgin media install broadband only to my property and within the first month I had no service due to a faulty box, it was replaced after waiting nearly a month to have it repaired, within 2 month of installation I had intermittent service and wifi issues with the box they replaced, I have been trying to contact virgin media for six month to have the issues resolved but have been unable to make contact with the correct department, when I did get thru to them I was put thru to faults and it was the same story everytime, I was told to unplug the box and then plug it back in and wait for it to come back on, I was also told to change the channel number in the settings on the box, neither of them made any difference, so I refused to pay for a service I wasn't receiving as advertised when they sold me the service, after wasting over a week on WhatsApp to speak to a customer service advisor I give up with this horrendous company and the next step from virgin media was to send debt letters out, I tried again to get the issues resolved and was unable to make contact by telephone or email, or maybe they were just ignoring me, a week ago I received a email saying they had cancelled the contract and were coming to collect the box today, so please be aware this company would rather loose you as a customer than sort out your issues, if they had sorted out my broadband issues I would of still been a customer today,"

188184,I ordered KFC I didn't know it was being delivered with deliveroo or I wouldn't have ordered it. The delivery driver pretended to call and spoke it a foreign language. Then cut then call and said he left the food with the concierge which we don't have. Proceeded to steal our food and we were offered no refund. I am contacting the police this is pure daylight robbery theft. Worst company I ever encountered.

At approx 6.30pm the tracker showed the van was about 5 miles away but then went miles in the opposite direction before eventually coming back to me.
The van had been on the road since 7am and the driver estimated he might be home by 9.30pm. Is this legal?"

111671,"Just mentioning argos devious ploy.bought a toaster over a year ago for £33.99,now its faulty contacted customer service basically they started passing me onto all there arrogant little colleages.i had taken out a care plan when i bought the toaster which means they instantly replace it.turns out the new price for it today is £52.So the assistant said she would organise to pick up the broken one and replace it with a new one.turns out suprise suprise they were all out if stock so she said she would refund me the £33.99 which was the original price meaning if i wanted to order the same one i would have to spend an extra £19 of my money when it should have been just a straight exchange but the same one was conveniently was out of stock when i menyioned it showed on the argos website it was in stock in all the colours she said it was the warehouse they send it out from but as i said conveniently it was out if stock in all the colours basically meaning if u bought something and the same product goes up in price a year later and if faulty u r entitled to a replacement if u have a care plan, instead of argos spending more money on the difference of price to replace it they just convenienly say it out of stock meaning u have to fork out extra money to buy the same one,also every time i phone up to ask them about this and gt my new toaster the customer service are very arrogant and intimidating.basically they are allowed to act the way they want and make up what tgey want and just ignore the argos policy."

189301,I placed my order for click and collect on December 18th. I am still waiting to hear if part of it has even been dispatched yet. Can't blame that bit on royal mail.

I’m being billed for the contract when I don’t even have a phone, how are they charging me for a contract when they aren’t even fulfilling the terms of the contract. I regret ever taking out a contract with this company and urge all to avoid at all costs. Terrible customer service and communication."

174605,"There are 2 deal breakers on the sports package NowTV offer.

1. They actively block VPN usage entirely from being able to stream. This is rather frustrating especially as Netflix, BBC and SKY does not block VPNs.

2. Now have limited to just 1 stream instead of 2 from July. I need to stream on my laptop and my TV, so this means paying extra for boost and that makes it too expensive for me. (i.e. already paying £33 for sports)

I hope Now will improve their terms so I can reconsider my membership, as the sports package content is good."
161633,Great quick response good customer service and great products
115564,"I am fed up of the lack of service provided by Virgin Media. Last March, we had a representative knock on the door and ask if we would consider switching to Virgin, great we thought as this was our desired provider but with it being a new build couldn't have it before. After multiple failed installation dates, multiple days booked off work for said installation dates (which may I add are cancelled by email the night before) we still have not seen an engineer and are still without virgin media services. I called on Friday after the latest cancellation to say I couldn't do the new date 3rd March and it was moved to 9th Feb, oh what a surprise to recieve another email today telling me it had been moved back to the date I very clearly said I could not do. I refuse to waste any more time on the phone to be lied to and ignored each time, I was promised on Friday that this would be the last change in date.. 2 days and that promise was broken! I would like this rectifying and the truth told.. if you cannot provide the services, tell me so I can look elsewhere instead of wasting my time!"

146405,"Ordered a Christmas Tree on 18/11 that was supposed to be delivered 24/11. Now almost two weeks later we have no Christmas Tree to put up and are £75 out of pocket. Studio use Evri for delivery, how any company can trust Evri with their goods is beyond me - we have had 3 different promised delivery times, each time we receive an email saying ‘we were unable to delivery your parcel!’ Despite the fact we have a ring doorbell and work from home so are home all day. No attempt has even been made.

Studio customer services team just don’t seem to care, 7 calls later, no apologies, no promised callbacks (meant to happen within 24 hours, apparently), agents seem to lie just to get you off the phone. One advised us that a complaint had been raised and then the next day another agent said there were no complaints live on our account, obviously just out to fob people off. Refusing refunds despite us not receiving what we ordered. Will likely seek advice from trading standards if a suitable outcome is not reached within the next few days."
161001,"Horrible company and customer service. Contacted today the agent was super rude and unhelpful. in the end asked to cancel my subscription because i just couldn't deal with the agent any more. after that the agent was tormenting me to cancel account myself. I counted in the transcript, had to ask 38 times an agent to cancel it for me. in the end it was a matter of principle."
160416,"Terrible customer service. Passed from pillar to post just for a simple question about their tariff. Then left on hold in silence with no update.

Following this review, which I had rated as 1, I received a phone call which went some way to restore my faith. Whilst this was helpful and answered my query it would be better if the agent had proactively provided the rate from 1st October instead of me having to point out there was a potential increase and its only 1 week away."

182976,"Went to Carphonewarehouse in Grimsby, and I have to say the young lady who served me was fantastic. She knew her stuff, went above and beyond, she was just all round brilliant. Would definitely recommend the level of service from this team member. Only grip really is the young lady was on her own with quite a few people waiting to be served. Get more staff hey bosses?? A very busy service with very little staff. This definitely needs sorting"

172762,"Received delivery of a washing machine which we paid installation for. 3 hours after the installer left we discovered a leak in the kitchen, caused by the cold water pipe not being correctly attached. I had to pull the machine out to turn off the water, and the (fixed) power cord was so short it got pulled out of the back of the machine. Kitchen kickplates were also water damaged. I called the customer services and the agent seemed completely disinterested however she called 'the depot' to explain the situation to them and I was told they would call me back in 30 minutes. I also asked to speak to a manager but was told there wasn't one. I then logged a complaint. 4 hours later I had received no phone call from 'the depot' so called customer services back. The person I spoke with said it was out of his hands as a complaint had been logged and it would take AT LEAST 48 hours (not including today) before someone would be back in contact with me. So we are left with a damaged kitchen and a useless washing machine and no resolution for at least a few days. No one seems willing to take responsibility or ownership of the problems caused by this negligent installation. We will absolutely never order from Currys again and will be seeking compensation and payment for the damage caused and escalte to Trading Standards if required."

I’ve read many reviews of people waiting for refunds, averaging around £350, shall we say 100 people are waiting for a refund, that’s £35000 in this cxxts account, but I feel it could be much more. I’m just about to call Ilford police to let them know of this company, and going through my bank to try and reclaim the outstanding money. These people should be ASHAMED of themselves. Let’s hope they get what’s due !!!!!!!!"

I was assured the network provided good signal. Though after using the network for a while I realised it was not and had really poor Internet and phone signal . I tried to switch networks in store after it was causing me problems though was told it was to late . I was on ee network before and never had no issues whatsoever and thier service is brilliant though carphone warehouse had stopped trading with
ee and I regret not staying with the ee network. I should have avoided carphone warehouse all together as was falsely sold a rubbish network. To make matters worse my new phone has been faulty so will be consulting them about this issue next. It's important to have a good phone network and would not recommend carphone warehouse to anyone"

After 25 mins phone conversation, and get blaimed about insufficent fund or wrong bank account, they found they are not able to provide service on my particular postcod. Also I was inforemd that not only they are not able compensate me regards to the my time, and the false promise, they will keep my details for 7 years for several legal reason and proposes including marketing!!! after my insist to their manager, they promise to not using for MARKETING!!!

130961,"Do not use this company!! I did for 10 years. After my last visit in store and upgrading I will not use them again. We compare, you save is not what this company does. Went in to store a few days after taking out upgrade and complained they did not find me the best deal. They said they would honour 14 day cooling off period (after speaking to manager on phone) but had to wait until manager was back in store. When I went back they said they wouldn’t honour it. Waste of time! I have been in contact with customer services, the store I upgraded with and regional manager, and all they can say is sorry we can’t do anything and insisted I was not offered 14 day cooling off period. If you really do find a good deal get it either online or over the phone as they offer 14 day cooling off period and have all information at hand if you need to make a complaint. Also if you are happy to wait until end of contract (which I was but was pushed to upgrade that day) open a new contract - they offer better deals- which is not what they offer you in store. Very upsetting that they don’t care about their loyal customers!"
140895,You used yodel to try and deliver a desk chair and yodel decided it was too heavy 90% into the journey and then sent it back to you. Though the guy i spoke to at Very was nice the only option i was given was to be charged again and it still be sent via yodel.

191291,"Mazuma used to be a good company to deal with but now it is clearly evident that they use the “chipping” approach when it comes to paying up for your handset. Other customers reviews have detailed they have experienced the same treatment and really it’s disappointing. I sent in an immaculate condition iphone 11, which had a case/ screen protector to be told that the screen has “scratches” really? Wear and tear is realistically expected for any 3 year old handset but this reluctance to pay your customers your quoted price for handsets you are going to sell on for a much higher price is shameful.

Avoid at all costs as there are much more customer centric recycling companies out there."

So far so good, the tv was collected but i have now been informed that it will be returned to me because it has been ""tampered with"" and some of the sticky tape holding down the internal cables is bent!
Have since spoken to the team who did not even know that it had been independently inspected, which does require the set to be opened to check fully.
I was then told that this meant that i could no longer claim under the Consumer Rights Act!!!!!
Am now waiting for update from Trading Standards and the retuen of my tv before having to go through an appeal process with Teamknowhow who may be a little biased.

Update 3.45pm
So Teamknowhow have replied to make it look that they care, but have simply decided they will use the info for an ""internal review and fed back to the relevant team"" without any indication that there will be any further feed back to me regarding the inaccurate info passed to me by their team."

147176,"Very reluctant to even be giving one star and not one to write reviews…

I was talked around to switch my current provider to BT back in December, promising that any cancellation charges would be covered by BT.
The initial installation was fine, if not a long months wait, however, after discovering that the BT TV also included having an arial fitted at an extra cost and with extra waiting time, I did not find the effort worth it. Upon speaking to a member of staff from BT, it was only then that I was notified that the cancellation charges (up to £300) will only be credited onto my account, and can be done ‘very simply’ via email. After expressing my frustrations that in no way was this explained in the first instance, I requested to speak to a manager and was promised a call back. After not hearing anything for 3 days, I called back with another promise of a call, only when they did, I was told that nothing was able to be done and a mere £16 would be credited on to my account. I do not have the funds to pay outright for a cancellation fee, which is currently causing a high amount of stress, but this has, very rudely, not been considered whatsoever.
Reluctantly, I sent BT my termination charges from my old provider via the email address provided. I have sent the amount of 7 emails to this service in the last 3 days with no avail, being told the same useless information each time. The communication between emails is absurd, with no evidence that anyone on their team are capable of assisting or carrying out a simple task, and still to this point have not had a resolution. I was told via this email chain, that I could discuss this via a number provided, which after calling said number, I was told they could not assist with the switch.
I honestly, wish I had never ever considered BT as an option and feel that so much angst and stress has been caused in the last 3 months that I highly advise anyone to avoid anything to do with BT!!"

160920,"Ridiculous to be forcing customers to pay for boost just to view content in 1080p.. It's nearly 2023, 1080p should be standard. I'd expect to be able to view House of Dragon in 4k HDR like Amazon have done for Rings of Power. I wonder how many people will cancel their subscription now HoD has finished. Not even remotely competitive with other services."
149790,"DO NOT ENTER INTO A LONG TERM CONTRACT WITH THREE!!!! I got iPhone 12 Pro with Three.

1. Till date haven’t gotten any 5g network so that’s a scam whatever they say on their website.
2. You feel like you are getting a better deal but it’s a SCAM every month they increase the prices of the contract so you are paying more than the market value for this iPhone.
3. I had a recurring discount on my account and every month I have to be behind their life to include this to my account and whenever I talk to them they say “The discount was just added so it will be considered from next payment” LMFAO!!!!!!!
This discount was applied last year by their senior manager and this is a good way of saying you have a discount but never applying the same. It’s pathetic how they saying something but charge way more thinking the customer won’t notice. Never seen a company so unprofessional and unethical.


Warning : DO NOT TRUST THREE WITH PAYMENTS!!!!


PLEASE DO NOT FALL IN THEIR TRAP SPECIALLY WITH IPHONES‼️‼️‼️"
145866,"Never go for Virgin !!
I have made the complaint a month ago and nothing was done. No reply , no call moreover any knowledge of whether they have received my email. I’m just waiting my contract to finish I’ll throw everything out."
171357,"My PC arrived on time and well packaged. I have had no need to call support on this order, but in the past they have been helpful and friendly.

I have two comments on the part of the website where you build your order.
First being that it would be handy to be able to filter the PC cases based on the parts you want to house, e.g. whether it can take a DVD drive.
Second is that it would be very nice to have the price of each component visible in the drop-down menus. They were available for some components, but not all. It would have saved me a lot of bouncing back and forth, and doing mental arithmetics.

Overall I am pleased with my product and the service."
196820,"Spoke to Ash who reassured the issue would be researched and I was under no time pressure at all .
Left with a good experience and common sence advice and problem resolved."
176162,"Absolutely awful customer service. Got quoted £95 (when I was paying £41) for the same contract. When I wanted to downgrade the TV package they hit me with a landline cost (of £35) which I didn't need. They told me there wasn't a package available to downgrade which meant I was forced to pay the installation. Virgin media do not care about customers, they care about how they can claw more money from you. If they did want to provide value, why would they force people to install landlines, even the agent said she had never used a landline before which is just bonkers to why they'd offer it.

In summary, Virgin Media leverage the fact they have good broadband speeds to lock customers in and charge them high premiums for no real value. They also love to include hidden costs, lock you in for long periods. I had to buy wifi extenders myself as they were going to try and charge me an additional £8 per month to ensure I got wifi across my house (it's a 2 bed house in LONDON)."
172136,I used the drop off kiosk. Instructions were not the easiest and hard to work out what you had to do along with the bar code not working. Once that sorted it was a reasonably easy process.
181814,I give PC Specialist five stars as the commutation throughout the process of placing my order was great. And on receipt of it my son was very delighted with his Christmas present as it looks great and was up and running straightaway with no issues.
156598,Excellent service and quick resolution to our issue

They invite you to trial a cinema membership for free (exact wording: ""Stream Promising Young Woman with a Cinema Membership"") and then automatically sign you up for an ""entertainment membership"" which covers TV also. I'm pretty sure this is illegal as all of the advertising says you're purchasing a free 7 day trial for cinema membership only. I'll be reporting them to the regulator."

I ordered on Black Friday . Up to now, I don’t have my delivery. Very frustrating as many of these items were Christmas gifts. Terrible customer service. The delivery has been at Evri depot since the 1st of December. It’s clearly lost but studio are not giving me a refund. They are telling me to wait 30 days!!! Shocking … i’ve had deliveries get lost in transit before with other companies and it has always been solved quickly. We are at a time where the cost of living is really high and people cannot afford for money to be held up like this. If they gave me my refund, I would go out to the shops and find alternative gifts. I’ve spoken to several customer service Reps and sent several emails… but studio just don’t seem to get it . They do not value customers as they can see from tracking that my order has not been delivered and refuse to give refund or transfer calls to senior members of staff. Please don’t risk it , order somewhere else that is more reliable"
174623,What great service best company ever bought a washing machine of them currys want £20 delivery marks cheaper and free delivery wont use any other company in future thanks
139247,"I was given a delivery window of 7am-7pm on Sunday. Messaging in the run up to the delivery was very clear and accurate. The team arrived at 7am, removed my old appliance, unpacked, checked and left the new appliance in the room of choice. I was the first of 25 deliveries that Sunday and they were friendly, polite and efficient. In all it took about ten minutes then they were on their way."
175532,Terrible company. Left them in March took them till December to pay my credit back. Must called them 15 times to advise change of address as they can only send a cheque. Consistently lied by customer service. After 10th call was told no information on file to say I had changed address. Each advisor ignored my request and refused to let me speak to manager. Very happy to be back with Sky.
170953,Internet kept going off. Customer services kept in regular contact via messenger and an engineer was sent. He was very friendly and sorted the problem.

Poor customer service team as well"
141468,"Felt obliged to write a review as every step is awkward, difficult and never ending with Virgin Media. Phoning them takes forever (I was passed to 7 people to close my account, giving the same security details 7 times). Endless sales trying to close the account despite me saying I have no interest in staying so clearly, several times on the call. No package sent to return the Vigin box so being charged £40. Spent £66 a month so it was very expensive, and terrible customer experience all the way. Richard Branson, this is the experience of your brand"
128439,"I like FFX and have used them for years, but their next day delivery is seriously hit and miss, and that experience is not based on just one order. My recent order arrived 2 days late. As far as I can tell, it wasn't dispatched by FFX until 2 days after the order! If it's vital that your item arrives the next day, I'm afraid I'd suggest buying elsewhere. Otherwise all good."
177465,"Not once, not twice but 3 times my order was cancelled by itself. I called several times and given great explanations and reassurances that this time it would not happen but kept waiting and waiting. I called the day before yesterday and was told everything was fine. I called again yesterday and was told everything was fine. I had to call again today because I never received a hub and no broadband activation. And again I was told that they would be very happy to pass me on to the sales department to put another order!"

This memory was for a friend of mine's son. Again the device arrived the very next working day after the order was made in a sealed bag, and the memory worked perfectly with no problems after installation.

The type of motherboard was listed on Mr Memory's web site and the correct memory for this was sent to me.

Once again a fantastic service from a fantastic supplier. I would highly recommend this company to anyone who needed to upgrade their memory or buy it for a self built computer."

160782,"Very disappointed, ordered a Samsung 22 Ultra yesterday (via carphonewarehouse website) and was delivered an iphone 13 pro. Went to Currys who said I have to take this up with the customer services. Now they will send a courier to pick up the phone after 2 days, will check the phone and then will send the right phone. Appalling service,
============
25/04 - update 10 days after placing the order - they said they have arranged for the pickup of the wrong phone, they forgot, then eventually picked up and then resent the wrong phone back to me. Now chatting with @Currysservices on twitter to get a refund and get the wrong phone collected. Twitter saga has been going on since 19/04, waiting for the refund of my 299 pounds paid for the phone and 51 pounds from vodafone for the first month's service that I have not used"

So three chargers for £70. However as it turns out the Google Pixel 2 is not compatible with wireless charging. So kept the c-cable and took the two brand new unused wireless chargers back. They would not give me a refund without all three present. Even though I had the receipt, would have added up to the price of the charger on the train to return a second time to the shop, no customer service whatsoever."

114643,"Vodafone, make so much money from customers, and as a customer, you can’t get help from their phone service. I have called their 191 helplines and only heard a computer voice asking questions and wouldn’t direct me to a natural person. Without jobs, why are big companies allowed to replace people with computers? As a customer, I want to engage with a human to get a human experience, not a computer. It isn’t fair after spending over £900.00 with this company. What happened to caring for the customer who supports your company? I wish the government would look at creating policies that stop big companies from replacing computers with people, which will help ease some of the burdens on our communities."

Day before/ evening by time picked up the message message order not generated go to shop reorder. Where they wanted me to pay another £550 and wait for refund in vouchers. Staff in shop great reordered.
Delivery date day after the original date only had to take half day off work. Paid for delivery as needed Tv quickly.
Hour before end of delivery time got automatic massage unforeseen circumstances delivery can not be made today phone this number.
Told van broken down , refund delivery if a want to complaint do so after delivery.
As I didn’t like the attitude of the person on the phone I went up the store the guy very understand looked on the system it said the tv was still in the warehouse and had not gone out for delivery. He spoke in the manager of the warehouse who said the van had broken down and they couldn’t get anyone out to it the 2 hours. I believe he may not have been telling the truth. As system said tv in warehouse.
Got tv delivered today tried phone number to complain lines down.
Never change gift of any vouchers in to argos they hold you to ransom customer service warehouse management nil shop customer service 10 out of 10"
197043,Fast and easy phone rental. The phones arrived within 24 hours and have helped upgrade the household whilst retaining existing excellent SIM only contracts that I didn’t want to lose. Only small issue is that the ‘good condition’ had a better battery health than the ‘very good’ and so if you aren’t too fussed about a cosmetic scratch it’s not worth the extra cost.
109417,Bunch of crooks. Hours on hold and once finally connected they just hang up on you saying they can’t help. Been trying to contact them for over 3 weeks regarding broken TV. They think they can treat customers as they wish which is disgusting. I will be taking the TV to curry’s once their stores reopen and will take this matter to the Ombudsman. Just pathetic.
140584,All kit delivered to wrong addresses. Customer not pleased with delay
106203,"They had the right product at the best price I could find online. When purchased, they shipped the monopod within 1-working day, kept me informed and it was delivered before expected. All in all, a very good service indeed."
159293,"What when wrong this time? ""this time""... correct question to ask: 2 orders, 2 faulty products. This time our coasters included someone else's photos. God knows where the photos of our children went and who has them now....
Customer service is as bad as it gets: only interested in closing the tickets as quickly as possible even when they know they've not resolved anything. Weeks later we're still waiting for someone to tell us what is happening to our order. Obviously that Christmas present won't be delivered before Christmas. We were returning customers but we'll be avoiding snapfish from now on."
153229,"I thought the MR Memory was awesome. The order was simple and I received my order sooner than expected. I have ordered memory from other companies only to find out that they were shipped from other countries which took a very long time to get what I ordered. By choosing a company that delivers from the US is the way to go.
The price; was great. I paid a reasonable price. I couldn't believe Dell wanted 3 times as much and for the same warranty. I totally recommend Mr Memory to anyone looking for reliable memory and at a great price. Great Job Mr. Memory, Keep up the Great work!"
101023,"So after this post, Quick Mobile Fix have fobbed me off for another 2 weeks giving a weak excuse for not paying my refund. If they can do this in 2 weeks why couldn't they do it 2 weeks ago.
This is my second poor review of this company and after the first should have learned about customer service. Very quick to take my money in April. Never delivered my mobile phone and still awaiting a refund after nearly 3 months with numerous poor excuses. I am now taking legal action to recover my money and I will post this experience on every review site I can find until you pay me every penny you owe!"
175224,"The rudest people on the phone.
They outsource to dolphin appliance who do not update customers at all. It has taken two months to have our dishwasher fixed, even when the engineer was saying it was a write off they wanted to try more parts which they were unable to tell us the time it would take for them to come in. Then couldn’t book a visit as December is a busy period!!!!!
They then finally agree that it is not fixable to then receive a link for replacement iPads rather than a dishwasher!!!!
The most stressful experience ever and still no dishwasher!!!!"

186727,"To actually get our new Volt bundle was a horrendous and v stressful experience. I tried online 1st, which did not work when it said our bundle would be set up. So I called virgin to find out why and the lady call handler could not speak or understand English very well. She completely mucked everything up, inputted a completely wrong email number when setting up Volt, which affected the O2 sim etc, charged the wrong price, said she'd arranged things when she hadn't, the list goes on, then I said I wanted to complain, so she said she also handles complaints (after I asked to speak to her supervisor, who she said was too busy to talk to me). She called me back, asked a question about the on off charge or something like that, after that call I checked the status of the complaint and it said resolved, which it most certainly was not. I was appalled. When I called the next day to try and get my email address corrected I explained the situation, the phone went quiet and I was transferred to someone else without being told, had to explain the situation, got transferred again and finally I get someone who was excellent. I was about to ask to leave virgin only Lorraine based in Glasgow stopped me doing so by sorting out all the things that were done wrong before. She was exceptionally good at her job."
177136,Absolute shambles of a company refused a refund on products that are over two weeks late and was told they don’t know when the products will arrive just because we don’t know. Apparently that’s a good enough excuse.
196953,"Wow to think 2 weeks ago i was more than happy with my who bt experience over the last few years, oh how that has changed over this period. What should have been a simple home move order to my new property placed on the 20/09 has led to problem after problem after problem. Home move order I had placed there was an issue and had to be cancelled and after hours on the phone they could not resolve it took a week 27/09 until I could re order for my house move and all looked to be back on track. No not with BT! no order confirmation of the new order and then yesterday morning my Internet has been cut off due to an apparent fault ,I rely on working from home so without Internet I can't work, the said it could take 7 DAYS to fix the fault,REALLY !! I work from home and no Internet for 7 days what am I suppose to do , But it gets WORSE! I spoke to the advisor and explained I could check if all was good with my home move order placed ready to switch over on the 8/10 , he explained that there was no record of the order that had been re booked on 27/09. So I explained that I need to get this booked as I'm moving property and require Internet only for the advisor to NOW SAY I can't place an order until the fault is fixed on the property I currently live in!! You can't seriously make this up , again what should have been a SIMPLE house move request placed 20/09 has left me with no Internet at my current property , can't place a home move order until that's fixed , unable to work from, utter shambolic attitude and behaviour from a company over 2 weeks I thought was really good and now has turned out to be one of the worst experiences I have ever had to deal with. NEVER AGAIN BT!!!!"
192265,"I've been ask to downgrade or cancel my contract as another company can offer the same service for the half of the prices that virgin media does. To downgrade is impossible as I need to start a new 18 months contract and if I cancel now I have to pay around £300 as cancellation fee because I've got left 5 months of my contract. I do have the 1 GB Internet speed what has never been more then 700 Mb/s for download and around 70-80 Mb/s for upload. Also my router, every hour, ( or even more) disconnects from Internet for about 30-40 seconds leaving me with no Internet in whole house. Very annoying if you watch a movie on netflix and very often you just got the message as the TV have no acces to the Internet. I've been a customer for over 7 years but this year will come the end. In all this years they have never send an engineer to fix any problems. I pay £62 just for 1 GB Internet what in reality is no more then 700 Mb/s in sunny days.
I don't understand why Internet have to be so expensive in UK as for example in Romania an subscription for a 10 times better service what is a 10GB/s service cost around £10/months."

128404,6 years costumer and never late with payment or something!I will never use 3 from now on! No good upgrades and after 6 years and 6 months I was using them without contract and they call me for contract so I accepted but the man on the phone didn't say that I will not have my international call and Internet as I have them before and now I end up with 2 years contract living on the border and painting money for nothing because they just thinking how to get money from you!
122830,"Terrible customer service with a real “we don’t care attitude” from management. Second time now an order has been missing substantial amounts of items and both times Deliveroo only offer to refund the missing items. The first time we were completely missing the childrens meals (which resulted in us having to leave our meals to go cold whilst going out to buy the children something to eat) and this time we were missing the sides for our KFC order, leaving us with a whole load of chicken and nothing else for our dinner. They refuse to send out the missing items and won’t offer a full refund so you’re left with half a meal and no other options. I don’t know many people who would want to eat chicken with no sides, or a curry with no rice etc, but because you’re not offered the option to have the meal collected for a full refund you’re left with no other options. We won’t be ordering via them ever again."
104086,"The company is a joke, lie about refund timescales. Still waiting. Dont take payments that are not yours if you won't refund them within the timeframes. Managers don't have a clue in that place told me I'm going round in circles, because they kept avoiding everything i was making a conplaint about. No compensation nothing! AVOID!! So glad I left this company nothing but hassle from start to finish."

Made an order which never arrived.

Contacted them every single day through various different ways. No helpful responses and refund of £150 has not been processed and the contract hasn’t been cancelled.

12 days later still waiting for confirmation that my order was cancelled and will be refunded. I have been told I still need to pay for the contract on 10th May for a phone I don’t even have.

Would NEVER use this company again."
140940,"Have a business broadband account and wanted a Business mobile contract. Went through all the options, found one I liked and was told that the phone and the broadband would be synced to my customer account and I would be billed monthly through my DD. Easy right?

The BT phone department did not link this to my overall business account. Instead they sent me a monthly invoice through the post, which I did not see for a while. Called BT to settle bill and asked again to have my accounts linked to my DD. Was told this would be fine.

Fast forward a week or so, I get a late payment demand of £40 on a £15 invoice.

Then a day later, another letter drops through the post and it is another monthly invoice as it still has not been synced to my account and current payment system.

Its not good enough. In the past I would have said you get what you pay for. BT were always pricey but their service was better then the industry par. Dont think I can say that now.

Will probably just opt for the cheapest suppliers next time as the service has gone.

How can BT expect to send a monthly invoice through the post and expect a company to call up right each month and settle it manually? and if not done straight away, slap on a 275% fine for late payment. How hard can it be to link it to an account that is already set up and paying the broadband through DD payments.

An now I'm expected to waste more time, which I don't have, setting up a social media account, which I don't have, to communicate through twitter."

163723,"Confirmation food delivered but no tracking prior to that and no deliveroo driver seen in the close. Restaurant reported driver had not delivered the food but only a credit to account. Ordered from the one restaurant we know have their own riders. Tried to use the credit for groceries 4 cupboard items arrived in one bag one nothing else- all chilled items including milk, meals, butter etc missing - tried explain to driver but he said 'no English' and went away - tiny refund given as there was 'no proof' and i must accept the 'delivery' i guess whatever random items they choose to deliver. Update three days later a parcel was found for me in the service entrance to another block - the lady came to give several parcels to neighbours that had been left there by delivery drivers over the weekend. She mentioned that Deliveroo had tried to deliver my Morrisons groceries to her address - i am guessing no refund from Deliveroo as the groceries had been refused at completely the wrong house number and road name."
172178,As per your adverts and description of the phone l purchased I’m very happy with it it looks in immaculate condition
131493,Currently with ID mobile and due for an upgrade. I found a deal on a phone that I want from Carphone Warehouse however when I check online for eligibility it doesn't have ID as an option. I emailed about the query and was replied back with they don't think I would be able too which isn't really a confirmation of a yes or a no but uncertainty. I decided to call up to get a confirmation and the person on the phone had no idea and just advised to go into the store to ask. Talk about hassle! I know what I want and it seems so hard to get. I don't drive and my nearest store is about an hour away. I am not travelling all that way to ask a question which could possibly be a no. Don't think I will bother with how dreadful the customer service is. Would of thought someone would be able to help with it over the phone or online given this day and age.
141385,"Excellent company to deal with, my order. Was delivered very quickly. Unfortunately I couldn’t use the item I ordered ( totally my fault for not checking spec), I returned the item with no fuss & received an immediate refund. Definitely recommend them"
155636,This company is unbelievable. The courier Hermes has seemingly lost my order. Despite numerous attempts to contact GHD I have had no response. There is no customer service phone number so all I have is automated email responses. So frustrating 😡😡
195712,"UPDATE: Jim is a great member and very professional for helping us.

The trade-in team has been awful and seems to be unfortunately separate from the core Carphone Warehouse business (maybe contracted out), and wholely unhelpful. It is also giving a bad image of Carphone Warehouse.

Jim has managed to help a lot and honored the promotion after contacting the trade-in team. Although this resolution did take a long time to iron out (not his fault).

I think Carphone Warehouse should evaluate the partnership services with what the trade-in team provides, because it seems to be them who are getting the bulk of negative reviews. The trade in team also hung up a lot of the time and were very rude to us.

The original review is mainly aimed at the awful trade-on team.









ORIGINAL:
My brother and I have reached out to so many people, and the customer service has been atrocious to be honest. Called at least 10 times, been hung up on so many times.

No one is willing to help

It seems like they are just screening my calls and not willing to work with me on a resolution.

It is clear that the trade-in team and customer service are really poor just based off other reviews.

My brother signed up for the trade-in offer of £100 +£95 for his Galaxy S8, but received no confirmation, no email, nothing.

Enquired about it as well, and have logs where a customer advisor from Carphone Warehouse said it will take some time for the bag to arrive.

Been spending so much time over the last few days on this and am getting nowhere, best not to deal with Carphone Warehouse.

The customer service team are poor and don't seem to be able to do anything about it, despite me offering alternatives."

Today i have shown them proof that the money has left my bank but they are denying knowledge that they have received it and gone to cutting off my services due to non payment.
What more proof do you people need? I don't do direct debit because you lot take it as and when you want not on the date it states, even if the date falls on a weekend you are meant to take it on the Friday...that's never the case!!!

This happens all day everyday. We are suppose to have the ‘super fast’ broadband, but we are constantly having the service drop out and it has been intermittent since day 1. Virgin Media customer service is absolutely shocking. Their ‘engineers’ who come out to issues are clueless. Go to BT, EE, Vodafone, Three, anyone but Virgin Media. You will get a better service and better broadband."

192476,"We ordered a boo burger recently it cost 23.23 . We waited nothing turned up , we had one missed call and rang it straight back, it was a number you couldn’t make reply calls to. We called boo burger to ask for advice they were unable to help. We opened a complaint on revolver. We received information first to say they left the food outside. We checked there was nothing, we went to our neighbours, nothing. We carried on our complaint. Each day same message, we are looking into it.
Each time my daughter verified her email and phone number, twice we received a message to say we hadn’t responded (we had).
Then they changed their story to say they had evidence of the driver waiting 9 minutes at our door, banging on our door. Complete rubbish we sat in the room right by our front door with our dog who goes mad when anyone knocks, nothing. What happened to the part of the story of them leaving the burgers, that suddenly changed. To cut a very long story short I am 23.23 out of pocket and left hungry. My husband then drove to Leicester and we had a burger from five guys. One we could actually eat.

Very disappointed with deliveroo and boo burger absolutely no customer service skills at all"

QMF took my original review down and they have NOT contacted me since as their communication is ZERO.
Have now received a refund via my credit card supplier it is the only way you will get your money back.
Have now used MUSIC MAGPIE and what a different experience delivery, communication returns and refunds. So my conclusion , AVOID AVOID AVOID do not spend a penny with these fakes.
GOOD LUCK"

I was told it would be delivered within 7 days and that I would be contacted to arrange delivery time etc. Week later, no phone call. I tried contacted customer support next few days and finally got through. I was told delivery would not be until 27th December, leaving us without a fridge freezer over Christmas period. Argos is misleading customers with their delivery information and poor communication. If I had known earlier, I would have cancelled my order and looked elsewhere. Will not be ordering large items from Argos ever again. Very disappointed with service."

123291,"Unfortunately, Team Don't Know How strike again!
I specifically ordered and paid for my Belling Range to be delivered, in the afternoon, on Monday, 16th August. I received a text stating the delivery would be between 1 pm and 5 pm. All appeared okay. However, Team Don't Know How delivered the large and heavy range about 12 pm ish...

Based on the information/text I received (i.e. delivery between 1 pm and 5 pm), I went to support my Mum and disabled foster brother. Next, I received a phone call from the Wrens' kitchen fitter about 12 pm ish stating the range had been delivered. I was shocked! I had received no message what-so-ever from Team Know How to inform me the range was being delivered earlier than anticipated. I was only 10 mins from my home and had I have been informed/contacted, I could have easily arrived back to support the delivery. I was told in Curry's PC World that I would be informed every step of the way about my delivery. Additionally, I paid more that £30 for the privilege to be informed.

I arrived home about 12.45 pm only to find the very large and heavy range sitting on my drive outside my front door (photo evidence available). Seriously! How am I expected to move a very large and heavy range by myself into position? 'That's why I paid extra money for a specific day/date/time to have the range delivered'.

Sadly, this is the second time I have been let down by Team Don't Know How. It's very simple 'just do what you promise to do' then, I wouldn't have to write a thesis about the poor quality service and inconvenience I have received.

I hope this matter can be resolved efficiently and effectively."

So I went to the store to be told the phone I wanted had to be ordered for delivery in store on Monday. The assistant said he would text me, when it was available to collect.
Monday came - no text, only a missed call from an unidentified number, but no a/p message. Tried for 3/4 hour to contact the store to establish if it was them that tried to call me. When I eventually got through to an operator, her only suggestion was to email the dept. and ask them to call me!!
I gave up and drove to the store - yes, they had phoned me and it had arrived. When I asked how I was supposed know that, when they left no message, and why they hadn't sent a text - blank faces all round, totally disinterested."

In feb 2021 we had a problem with our Beko washing machine we called and had a someone come out to look at it. Basically it needed a new door and a new drum which they ordered and said someone would be in touch to fit. They came round about a week to 10 days later with the wrong drum as they had problems sourcing the correct one for our machine, we were then told it would most likely have to be written off but they couldn’t do until after 14 days. Not happy with this as can’t be without a machine, so we had to purchase another and was informed at the time to keep the receipt and email it through to them and they would arrange a refund. Well what an absolute joke this was after numerous emails and chase up phone call we were hung up on and no response to the emails we were told that they hadn’t received the email even though we had sent it through numerous times, we finally after 2 MONTHS received a voucher, and after querying this via emails and phone calls we were eventually told that if we took it to a curry’s store we could get it transferred back in to our bank. WHAT AN ABSOLUTE JOKE THIS COMPANY IS THEY ARE USELESS, this week intend to cancel everything that I have covered through them and go elsewhere. AVOID AT ALL COST."

176998,"Joke off a company, between them and Dpd they have lost the chrome book I purchased. Now because it’s lost in transit it can take 14-28 days to resolve. The common sense thing would be to send out another one for me and resolve this internally. Instead I have to sit here waiting for incompetent staff and they won’t give me a refund because it’s lost in transit.
Disgusting customer service as soon as it’s resolved and they send the laptop out it will go straight back to the store for a refund and my money will be spent elsewhere."

We cancelled the orders, they told us to wait for two weeks for refund, it’s now 3 weeks without the refund.

164938,I had looked at many different companies before choosing to purchase from curry’s and they were the best value for money. Their delivery drivers were also very polite and helpful.
162517,Excellent service and quick delivery
120094,"If there was a 0 this would of been ticked. Still waiting 15 days on for items that are not even dispatched. Phoned three times, nobody gets back in touch. Refusing to let me now cancel order and refund even though I'm going away next week. Customer Service is awful and conveniently there's never any manager available. Please don't ever use this company, you will end up with no gifts and no refund! Worst company ever."
187211,Prices up again and customer service down....wl be moving my contract shortly
127180,Made some great calendars for Christmas presents. Great quality and amazing price.
166298,"Excellent service, my new computer is fantastic! I've had no issues with it thus far, and am sure I won't for years to come. I've always trusted PCS with their builds, and I am looking forward to many years of gaming with my 3080"
160744,No received my refund after returning my item order . Still waiting?
168164,"Quick delivery, good quality CD and good value."
136125,"I placed an order for a new contract deal where I get £365 back for my old phone. They promise a next day refund. I returned the phone in their packaging special delivery to ensure it arrived quickly and safe at my own cost. The phone was and I hope is still like brand new in full working condition. However, 4 days after they received my phone I decided to chase up as I had heard nothing back from them. I am concerned that after making the effort to send the phone back next day special delivery, that it's been lying around somewhere and might have been damaged (I hope not). After speaking to someone today, I found out a payment for £240 is being processed. This is £125 short of what I was expecting. Further to that the payment will take another 3-5 working days. So the NEXT DAY marketing material is a lie. I am now having to wait another 48hours to find out where's the missing £125."
122831,"The worst broadband in London, I have been disconnected for almost a week now. And they are careless, they said they don’t know what’s the issue and they will send an engineer but they didn’t and every time I call I want an hour on the phone with no solution.
Last month with them for sure"

Spot on service!"
160045,"I had a harrowing experience with Absolute property services from Bark.
I posted a job on Bark for a leaking roof after a few minutes Tom from Absolute property services contacted me and said he can come and quote me for the job after an hour.
Tom quoted me £750.00 and if I paid cash £550.00. I said there were other people coming to view the job and I wouldn't go for the first quote.
Tom then said if I wanted him to do the job he'd need to take a few tiles off the roof as I neded new tiles and he had to take them to the builders warehouse to match the tiles up.
I reluctantly allowed him to take a few tiles with him then felt obliged for him to do the work for me.
He came the next day went up on the roof for couple of hours and said the leak was fixed and the work is guaranteed for 12 months
Few weeks later the roof started leaking at the same place called Tom back and asked him to come and have a look and that the roof was leaking from the same place he said he'd come the next day and won't be able to give me an exact time when he'll be arrive.
I waited all day decided to give him a call before it got dark got no response.
However the following day I tried calling him again there was no answer then he blocked my number as well.
Don't use Absolute property services they will rip you off and won't do the job they promise to do.
I am left out of pocket and with a leaking roof."

So impressed I’ve used them again and probably will do again if I need anything else printing in the future. Reasonable prices too! Plus they give you money off when you use them again.
129332,"I've been buying my AV equipment from Richer Sounds for the past 20-odd years and they have never let me down.

I recently bought a Ruark R1 radio through the clearance on the website. The next day I received a phone call telling me the item wasn't available.

Out of goodwill, they managed to find a brand new radio in the Edinburgh branch and arranged for next-day delivery via DPD, all for the original discounted price.

Amazing service!"
132503,I have dealt with AO several times before and I've always been very pleased with the service
111763,"Great service, ordered Thursday received Friday. Faultless!!"

108411,"BE Warned ...
BE Warned .... make sure you photograph your product from every angle before you send it to currys team knowhow for repair. They fixed my tv's initial fault but sent it back to me with a new fault that they caused. Now they have written it off and are only offering a 1/4 of the value of it in their vouchers. Seriously these guys broke my tv and think they can get away with this! oh and in addition they have managed to damage the back casing of the TV not that it matters anyway now!"

Acceptable price . Good delivery times."

My first call out took place on 24th August and the voucher for my oven replacement was promised 7 days later and I am still waiting. I shall never go near Currys again and I hope that other customers will take heed at this email to definitely not purchase a team know how guarantee as it is not worth the paper it is written on.
6 weeks without an oven - please send the voucher or see you in court."
147609,"Quick process, fair price given. Takes the hastle out of selling privately."
172239,Such a quick and easy way to sell my phone and I got the price quoted. Sent by Royal Mail and was kept informed by email re where the parcel was in transit. Posted on a Monday afternoon and the money was in my account within a week. Highly recommended.

How do I return within given timescale please. Need an exchange. Not enough GBs

Thanks."
102361,Really disappointed with the service. I ordered a hair straightener on black Friday sale in November. The order got sent back and I never received it. After calling few times they resend it and I got charged twice for the same item. Still waiting for my refund. Probably won't order any more from them.
179905,Lovely quality cards i only wish you could go back and look at your finished design before you commit to purchase. It was difficult to check the layout.

Assembled within a week and if you contact then you can also say when you want it delivered, which is also great! Kinda sucked it was super early delivery but that was outside their control. Besides that, super satisfied, great product and I recommend buying laptops from them100%"

I was delighted to find what I was looking for with ease. Dispatch was super quick same day. My laptop is working so much faster now so I'm a very happy customer."
123297,That I could change the date for delivery but unfortunately couldn’t change the time due work commitments the the speed of getting the phone getting dispatched and delivery was quick and efficient which is brilliant the website was easy to use
144398,"Utter Nightmare and impacting my mental health.
I terminated my account with Vodafone 2 years ago - I dont have their phone anymore. Vodaphone issued a PAC code on termination which was never used by my new provider as I didnt keep the number - so Vodafone kept taking money from the bank account for 2 years! (it was my husbands account so I didn't know) Once I found out I told him to cancel the Direct Debit. NOW as the DD payment was stopped Vodafone have blacklisted me for money they themselves acknowledge I don't owe - my credit card limits have been reduced and interest rates increased because of it. Have spent hours trying to get thru - often get cut off - I get passed around from team to team and every time have to go through the whole story - then they see the problem and agree that they in fact owe me money.... and NOTHING HAPPENS. I am still chased by debt collectors and my credit score is ruined... Thank a lot Vodafone !"
105083,"Ordered a few times from cex for switch games, great service, really good condition x"
152631,"I bought a phone from Carphone warehouse with a contract. After receiving the phone I realised I was unable to send texts. I contacted the contract provider who stated they had no details of me taking out a contract and therefore my phone wasn't linked to the contract provider. I then rang Carphone warehouse multiple times who would not discuss the problem with me, always stating it wasn't their fault and they had sent the information off. The contract provider had done investigation to prove the fault want on their side and eventually said (after 3 weeks) they were unable to help me further. Even then a rude woman from Carphone warehouse told me there was still nothing they could do and that the contract provider needed to talk to them personally which they had already told me they couldn't due to GDPR. Finally they did an investigation which took 2 weeks which, of course, showed a problem. They said I could have a refund or be sent a new sim. I opted for the new sim which came the next day. I still had the same problem with the sim. I spoke to a very helpful manager in the Carphone warehouse shop who told me both sims were still faulty and I needed to ring customer service again and ask for a refund. This I did and was again spoken to very rudely and told I couldn't have a refund as it hadn't been 5 days since I received the sim, even though I was offered a refund before and had spoken to a manager in store who stated I should have one. She also told me I was unable to talk to a manager over the phone. I've had a faulty phone now for over a month and every time I try and talk to someone from Carphone warehouse over the phone I end up angry and crying with frustration as it's like banging your head against a brick wall. It takes an awful service to not give you a refund when a product they have sent you is faulty and refuse to even talk to you properly for the first month. I have only spoken to 2 helpful people on the phone in a total of 7 phone call. Everyone else I have spoken to have been rude, dismissive and talk over you. The people in shops are lovely and I would buy from them again, BUT NEVER AGAIN ONLINE! I have said 2 emails and a formal complaint that have been ignored! I have spent around 7 hours on the phone, and 2 hours in store and they problem is still no way near fixed! Abysmal service!"
181540,"Since I renewed my service due to a house move I an inundated with spam emails. It wouldn't be so bad except I don't use that em address now and have changed to gmail. Subsequent phone bring promises of deleting the email address with on the last call, a promise of a call back within 48 hours to confirm it has gone. This has not happened and the junk still arrives. I don't even have that email address set up on my iPad or phone. Having been a long-serving BT customer, we shall not renew when the time comes. They have now replied requesting I contact them via Facebook or Twitter, but I don't use those things. What an assumption on their part!"
124621,"I cannot recommend NOWTV Broadband.
Although the switch from my previous internet provider went okay, the automated payment on their website does not work, even though I've double-checked the details and manually provided (by phone) exactly the same payment details and this transaction has gone through successfully.
Additionally, the standard NOWTV router provided has a very limited WiFi range compared to other routers that I've had before and you might find that you'll need to buy WiFi extenders to ensure coverage even over a relatively small area.
Furthermore, it's been incredibly difficult to contact NOWTV customer services and the service provided once I got through to them has not been of particularly good quality (the person that I spoke to recently did not speak good English and was difficult to understand)."

Total disaster. Avoid even if it’s cheaper!"

175377,The electrician arrived on time and solved the problem quickly.
164382,"I would 100% recomend pc specialist especially for people who are new to the world of pc's. The website is easy to use and when you are done configurating your build they tell you if it is all compatible and if you have some componenets that are unnecessarily powerful for the build so you do not waste any money components. The only complaint i would have is that it does take a long time to arrive (nearly a month), however I belive this is not down to pc specialist themselves but rather the fact that it is hard to get the parts at the moment. Also when the pc does arrive they send you an email on how to set it up so you do not make any mistakes. Amazing company for people purchasing their first pc."
152099,"I'm still waiting for a refund!. Washer returned in Sept, requested a refund, was told it was on its way, had to return as refund never arrived, told the refund was only sent that day; 25th Oct would be in my bank account 3-5 days, it never arrived so returned today/7th Nov and had a repeat conversation, refund has been sent today wait 3-5 days!. In the mean time I will start a small claims court action against Argos, which will force Argos to pay my money, and to pay the cost of the court proceedings. I suggest any customer facing the same problem do as I will. £230 Argos owes me, and despite the 3 times I asked for my money, I'm still out of pocket. Don't be a customer of Argos, robbing Bs!. Argos, re; Your reply. Of course I'm not going to go round the one way roundabout that leads to another dead end regardless of where it starts, Twitter/Facebook, done the journey too many times, how about I start a FB page called 'we need to talk about Argos' so customers can vent their anger?!, that suit you?,"
101234,"Arrived on time, runs smoothly and efficiently"
199512,"After paying for this service monthly for a few years now I called for an engineer as my washing machine wasn't working, there was no appointment available which suited me or my partner so we had to take the time off work (unpaid) to accommodate the engineers visit, I work away so my partner had to arrange his time off, he waited for the time slot that we were given to pass, then I was called to say that the engineer wasn't coming as he was sick, not good enough, I have had to arrange for another day which didn't suit (at a loss to me) me so that I can get my washing machine fixed"
117928,"Friendly, helpful and knowledgeable service, as always. Fast delivery, very happy."
130567,"Driver was incredibly rude, attempted to deliver earlier than the allocated slot and refused to accept we had paid for removal and recycling of our appliance. Even with evidence of our order they still refused.

The call centre confirmed it was a known issue with the order system but that still wasn't enough."

177970,"If I could give them 0 stars I would.

Shocking customer service. I have used Carphone Warehouse for years when I am due a new phone, but never will again. When I bought my new phone I was offered £190 for my old phone and £150 additional based on an offer they had. It took nearly 2 months, several phone calls, several unanswered emails for them to actually send me the pack to send them my old phone. When they did get it, they revised their offer to £20. When I queried it they just returned my phone to me, didn't respond to any of my emails.

Avoid like the plague. I will never give them my custom again"

125738,Now TV has been charging me from May 2021 to July 2022 and i have never signed up or ever watched anything on Now TV. They have said they would give me 3 months free for compensation. Why!! don't watch it and i'm not planning to... the most annoying thing about this is have to waste my own time chasing them on a silly online chat. this chat craic is to make it hard for the for the customers/victims to get a result in they're favour. Now TV what a load of SSH*T.
189486,"Far too many phone options to avoid human customer services then, when I eventually get through, service adviser can't understand me and I could hardly understand them. Will have to call back and hopefully get a different adviser."

102250,"I called to say that my broadband kept on cutting out only to be offered an upgrade. I said that the line isn’t stable and the operator said they’d resolved my complaint by offering me an upgrade and that was that

I then went online to see that the upgrade was cheaper than what I got offered. I mistakenly clicked order but then once I’d realised what I’d done I called to cancel. The operator said there was no order as it auto cancelled. I then had an email stating my upgrade had been processed. I called back to again get this cancelled, the operator said that they had cancelled but i then I revived an updated bill. I called to log a complaint only to be told that they would cancel my order and that would resolve my complaint. It still hasn’t been cancelled so I’ve logged a formal complaint of which I’ve had no response. I’ll have to wait 8 weeks paying a higher tariff that I didn’t want until offgem will look at it. I wished I hadn’t gone anywhere near virgin!"

140724,"I had taken out the extended warranty with appliances direct for my new kitchen appliances. Just over a year later my oven stopped working, after nearly 6 weeks without an oven the warranty service provider agreed it needing replacing from appliances direct. I then had to chase appliances direct for the replacement several times, little did I know how much it would cost me. Received my phone bill, £42 for 2x 30min phone calls, 25 min of those being on hold! 1. I shouldn’t have to chase for my replacement 2. Change your phone line to free call! Disgusting.

191812,"When ordering the 4k Bluray player it did not show as out of stock. I did however receive a call from Ash in Customer Services, who was very helpful. He offered to cancel the order and refund me but as I was not in any particular hurry I decided to wait. Ash was unable to advise when Richer Sounds were due to receive a delivery from Panasonic. Thankfully this must have happened very soon after, as I received the player within another couple of days. Overall a great service from a company that I have used many times and will do so again. Special mention to Ash in Customer Services. Thank you."
181359,"We'll once was bad enough but second time is a disgrace.
I was assured by the Three salesman that my broadband router would work in Spain and Greece I spent days endlessly getting no where and had to pay the hotel £35 to use their internet per week.
On my return I was sent a new router and Gus's what I'm now in Greece with the same problem as before and as for help from live chat it's a waste of time all I'm told is to report the problem to Three on my return to England.
Rubbish and a waste of time trying to speak direct to someone.

108189,"After researching platforms like this one, Brandbassador came up over and over with recommendations on using it. Other users and reviewers seem to find it highly preferable so I just signed up and I'm looking around! So far, so good. There seem to be opportunities for me and I literally just got started so that's exciting! It's also comforting to know I'm not wasting my time on something that's not reputable!"
139188,Three is the NO 1 WORSE NETWORK in the UK with no data and connection in so many places including centres of cities you cannot get data. Calls drop all the time. I have been complaining for 3 months but they just fob you off to one another and ask you to keep explaining what the problem is to the next person after keeping you waiting on the line for up-to 30 mins at a time. This company should be taken to court by all its customers as they are blatantly robbing us. If anyone is coming here to review Three as potential new contract I would advise you to look elsewhere as this really is the poorest quality network and most appalling customer service in the UK.

I didn’t receive it, I had to call them for them to tell me jan 12th. I’ve now had to call them to keep myself posted, they haven’t emailed or text me!"
166687,"Edit: was told a manager would ring me within 24-48 hours which they never did. I have contacted them a few times but a complete waste of time and effort. Worse company I have ever dealt with. If my money is not returned by Monday, I will be asking for a chargeback which will cost them money.

Bought a pay as you go phone and paid for it outright. No issues my end and the money left my account. On delivery day, I got a text on the day with my one hour slot. My phone never arrived so I checked the tracking number to find car phone warehouse had requested the phone to be returned. Rang them to be told there was no information as to why. Asked for a complaint to be logged and to speak to a manager. They’ve told me 7 working days for my money back. Totally disgusting and fraudulent. They didn’t even contact me. I’ll be taking my business elsewhere from now on."

193770,"Okay I'm telling it how it is. Look at any TV guide and it will show the wide lack of variety under the entertainment channels.

It's all the same stuff. Channels such as Cartoon Network, what in the heck have they done to it. Boomerang too. My point is that the entertainment package just isn't entertaining. Let's talk about Comedy Central. I mean don't get me wrong Friends is a funny show, but it is never ending. They may as well call it the Friends channel.

Now my other issue is with the app. Why, why isn't the TV guide at the top of the screen. It's one layer below the top of the app. Why!? The TV guide should be the first thing that I select. It should go straight to the TV guide and there should be a setting to allow it to. Possibly a useful feature in the future. If it is a TV service, then I want a guide so I can know where I'm at.

The bottom line is this. Fix you app. Lower your prices and then maybe just maybe you could get more people on board. They keep offering me 7 free day trials so obviously it's all rubbish isn't it."

131835,"Ordering on line then receiving the discs click and collect at the local store, takes the stress out of the purchase. I was kept informed by email, with notifications when the pack was ready for collection. I don't have a smart phone, but took in the order number and there was no problem."
128345,Great service arrived on time first class attention
145107,"I felt that the staff in Staples Corner, in Currys didn't care about my situation but was there to sell a phone. Had I known that the phone would not be available immediately to take away (as I was without a phone due to it being stolen) I would have gone somewhere else to purchase. I was only informed of this half way through. I did not get an email receipt as requested. When I checked my bank account I noticed that O2 had taken direct debit from the next day although my phone was not going to be in my possession until another 2 days later! Just because I had the SIM that does not give them the right to assume that I would be using it with another phone!

The staff members were unsumpathetic and had a careless attitude. When I asked for assistance to set up the phone, I was informed that there would be a charge!! What a joke - the manager was no better.

If this is a reflection of how Carphone Warehouse operates then it is shameful!!"
112080,"My claim with Music Magpie is still ongoing, even though I posted my items (an iPad Pro 4 12.9 128GB and an iPad Air 128GB, both 4G + WiFi) on the 17th of November. The order value was almost £800. I used Asda’s to You postal service and they were marked as delivered. I heard nothing for days after the delivery from Music Magpie. I messaged their online chat (they have no phone number) and was told my order still had to get to their warehouse but that items are processed and paid for the same day after this. Days passed and nothing. I started another live chat and was told my order couldn’t be found and had been lost. An investigation was started and I was told the claims team would keep in touch. They never replied to my emails and still haven’t, I am chasing the claim almost daily for updates, and am told something different on Facebook vs. their live chat every time. Nobody can tell me what happens next. Your items are supposed to be insured and covered. I had to provide proof of purchase and IMEI numbers for my items, if I hadn’t have been able to do this the claim would have been closed and no payment received. I quote from an email, “(we) would like to point out that failure to provide any requested information may delay or result in a Claim being declined.”

I dread to think what would have happened if I wasn’t chasing this daily. I’ve provided everything they’ve asked and it’s been the required 14 working days since the claim started and I still haven’t been paid. They haven’t confirmed if the value of my order will be increased (I thought the 128GB iPad Air only had 64GB, I was waiting on them assessing this after delivery to confirm value) or not. They haven’t answered any of my questions and won’t show me the terms and conditions of payouts.

I regret using them, the experience has made me so anxious and feel so stressed. From rude and condescending customer support to lack of communication to never ending wait times, I’m now seeking legal advice on how to proceed. I’ve never had such a bad experience with a company. I’m having a baby in January and worry it’s not going to be sorted in time. I’m certain I’ve just lost the almost £800. I feel like I’ve been stolen from.

EDIT: I have not been contacted by Music Magpie privately. My Facebook message has been replied to but it did not answer or address any of my questions or concerns. I still have no date or confirmation that I will be paid."

I paid for my warranty washer and tumble dryer in November 2018 the payment was taken out off my card as a combined one payment for both items.
In August 2019 my dryer broke i called them up for customer services to state to me it was NOT covered
I stated my payment date , Team know how told me that my policy had been back dated to June 2018"""""""""""" 6 MONTHS PRIOR"""""""""""" . I lodged a complaint and they are not interested admitting that they had back dated it , disgusting how can a company back date a policy over 6 months , so i paid a yearly warranty and only got 6 months

189331,Ordered 2 items and was told the delivery for both would be on the same day. After staying in all day waiting for them only 1 item had been delivered and the other had not been sent by Argos at the same time the other item is now due the next day and I am expected to wait in for the delivery. Contacted customer services and have basically been laughed at. I would never order from this company again as they cannot give any time for deliveries except between 7.30am and 9pm. Order for pick up in store if possible as you may be told the truth about delivery. Lie about delivery all the time

108626,"Today I’ve been let down. The Delivery driver was absolutely useless/ grumpy he was allocated the WRONG van with no tailgate?? AND he has a bad back?? Seriously why is he on delivery duties ?? - why send him to deliver a 120cm Range cooker at 175kg?
He didn’t want to reverse into my snowy drive either - I offered to reverse it in, so was right next to my totally cleared pathway- as I’m use to reversing in/ out but he said no! The other chap said was a good idea. Very nice man!
But, driver refused point blank to try, think he’s was nervous driver as said wouldn’t get off drive again-due to snow!! (second lovely chap would have def done it but he’s not the boss ) this is with me paying £170 for delivery connect/ disconnect / and bulky item fee- so disappointing, as need this urgently for Xmas. My current oven turns off all the time/ is unrepairable. Hence new one! At a huge cost of the item too, due to its width. The sales team were great very friendly. I had an email sent re delivery on Sunday at 18.13pm?!? I replied yesterday (Monday) , as was at wedding Sunday all day/night - no reply at all from Kristy- as she’s now on holiday all week until Friday? Why not message me having given time to reply? Or ask another agent to take my case? Then today I’ve tried 8 times to get through on the phone - no answer- the last call was a 25 minute wait. I desperately need a new delivery date before Xmas so I have tried live chat - wrote everything on message bar & says they are all off line. I give up…..2 stars for friendly sales team. Please call me when u read this! My number is connected with my order. Thank you very much x
20/12 :- Following this bad service, my husband finally (they need help on the phones) got through to Sara, the next day- she was however, the turning point in all of this. At first we were offered a date after Xmas. Then, following a number of convo’s she managed to get us squeezed in 2 days later, which was absolutely amazing. She was extremely understanding of our upset & apologetic too. Explained about teething problems. Very, very helpful and very friendly. Well done Sara. Delivery drivers were very nice too. With a “can do” attitude. It’s a very heavy load, we understand, so it’s not easy. So a big thank you to SK and John- both lovely helpful chaps. One was a qualified electrician and one a gas man. After nearly 2 hrs with us, it was complete. Big thanks to all 3 :)) A happy ending!
Also, Thks to Jetal for following up direct with us, post delivery. With many apologies again and ensuring we ended up happy with our service- overall . We are NOW very happy and love our new range cooker too!"
101300,"Excellent service from start to finish, ordered a new fridge/freezer on Thursday evening, it arrived Saturday morning. Ravi and Jamie removed our old (over 20 years old) fridge/freezer through our small kitchen and delivered our brand new model. They were professional and friendly throughout and nothing was too much trouble for them. They also removed all packaging and left our home as tidy as it was before they arrived. We will definitely use this company again in the future."
135766,"What makes PlugInBoutique stand out from the other 3rd party sellers is that I can view my entire order history incl. serial numbers and download links & instructions in the account page. This also eliminates errors such as mistakenly ordering the same item again months later at a sale, having never used the already purchased item and forgotten about it (this happened more than once to me on AudioDeluxe). Also, they don't do hard-sell pop-ups like another competing site, and they offer regular free-bees with purchases (like AudioDeluxe)."

They offered to buy a laptop after I input the details and condition correctly, after posting it in I heard back about a month later saying the item wasn’t recognised and they were going to recycle the laptop.

156253,"The staff is inexperienced. 6 months ago fiber came to my area and I was excited to upgrade. Since I was abroad for another 6 months I asked if I can upgrade later, specifically asking them about the fact that certain installations of fiber can run out depending on the number of customers in the area. They said it will be fine, ""Once fiber comes to your area, it is available whenever you want."" 6 months later, guess what? It's gone. They confirmed this from the previous chat log. They said they are sorry. (I was going to upgrade from 1 Mbps to 1 Gbps) Thanks, TalkTalk!

My partner's desktop arrived extremely delayed (I'm talking months) and then when it did arrive finally, it had to be returned due to damage.

In addition to their poor customer service (ignored emails, saying they'll do something and then don't, I could really go on), their products are not fit for purpose. Within the first month of use, my gaming laptop had to be plugged in during use as the battery was so poor and ran out unusually quickly. 2 years later, and I am now considering purchasing a new laptop as my current one is failing.

191454,"Really shocking experience. I moved home on the 1st of May and my existing broadband provider (Virgin) don't supply in the new area. So a quick search and i found NOWTV do broadband through sky through Open Reach. Signed up for it on the 29th April fully aware will take around 2 weeks to be up and running. There portal explained that my estimated install date was the 14th May (no biggy) and that i would receive my Hub in the post 3 days before. I received my email confirmation and a letter through the door. all good signs. It wasnt until Monday the 10th ( 4 days before go live date) that i decided to call them to check if my Hub was on the way. This is when the issues started. I was advised that for some reason, open reach had apparently cancelled my order 2 days after i submitted it. NowTV didnt notice this and no one reviewed my order to understand what the issue was. I was told it was an IT glitch and all they had to do was cancel my order and re-raise it again and if i called 24hrs later they could look at an expedite. So i re-set it back up on Monday the 10th, called back on Tuesday the 11th to make sure all is good and was told NO, that there was another system issue. Becuase the previous person hadnt cancelled my original order correctly, they would need to raise some IT ticket, that would take 72 hours and I would then need to call back on monday the 17th May to ask for a new order and then wait another 14 days for delivery (thats if it even worked). I told them there and then to just cancel it all and i've now taken it elsewhere. My only concern is whether they now have screwed up the Open Reach systems. Time will tell. Absolute shambles of a company. I work from home and i'm now stuck using my mobile hotspot until the end of the month. Stay clear of them."

141905,"My second experience with BT after 4 years. Nothing has changed, they just advertise better. We pay £30 pm to have a 4mb speed. We have not gone over 10 mb since we started the contract 2 months ago.
Called support, they said we will get a 4G hub to help with the connexion - never came. Apparently you have to pay for accessories to get the most basic service that you were already paying for....? what?! no thanks.
engineers have come out twice and both times the conclusion was: the cable is eroded. We asked for it to be changed, they refused and said, we'll try something with the box outside. Obviously, nothing has happened and we are now waiting for the 3rd round of engineer, while still paying for a service that does not work. Super.

Please avoid. Get Virgin, it's just as bad."

117745,"Terrible, didn't hit delivery in time for Christmas despite ordering 3rd December, blamed Royal Mail strikes but i am sure the order was just missed and not processed until I chased it up. When I complained first you promised it would be delivered for Christmas, when I queried a second time you said no chance it would come for Christmas and it's Royal Mails fault. The delivery has came now but no sign of the original which you said was 'in transit'. Then reordered my delivery which just came, so really 2 should have came but they didn't. Just disappointing really, speaking on chat was very unhelpful and didn't even try to get my order sorted."

163430,"I thought I have seen bad customer service but Virgin Media is awfully and dangerously worst. They take it to another level. I have been with Virgin Media for over 10 years and I have seen countless of
frightening experiences. You will ask why are you still with them, I was enduring because the broadband seems good. So I endure but not no more. Over these years I have written more than 5 complaints and 1 is currently with the Ombudsman. I feel headache after every conversation with them.

I will only give 2 reasons here:

I rent my house furnished and one tenant decided to subscribe to Netflix with my virgin account in the house. When the tenant left, Virgin refuse to remove the Netflix subscription so I was paying for another person's subscription for close to a year. All through these months I was asked to go to Netflix to terminate the account. Now the matter is with the Ombudsman and they are now offering me less than half of the refund.

Because of these poor treatments, I decided to close one of my accounts as I am fed up with their poor and awfully customer service. My account was terminated without telling me and when I challenged it, it was reinstated after about 5 days. They wanted me to pay for those days my account was terminated and offline. I challenged them again and in the process of looking into it, my credit file was marked with missed payment. I called them nobody can give me any info. I decided, to pay the money yet they still marked my file with another missed payment the next week.

Virgin media may have a good product but the people are terrible. These are some of the few things I have noticed:
The call handler agents are poorly poorly trained
They won't call you back when they say I will call you back
Nobody takes responsibility
They are in a hurry to pass you to the next agent
The complaint process is rubbish
Forget it, you can't speak to any other person/Manager other than that poor call handler agent
Be prepared to wait for minutes and when someone answers be prepared to be on the phone for at least an hour as you will be tossed from one agent to another
They don't communicate with other departments.

Good luck, if you are going to join Virgin Media and well done for enduring if you are still with them. As for me, I am gradually leaving them. I only have 2 contracts left and at the end of them I will leave them"

173122,I have just contacted BT about a fault on my broadband to be told it’s an external fault and they will need until Wednesday to fix - 5 days !. Other people on my estate are on BT with no problem. Advisor tells me nothing can be done and they cannot offer an interim fix as I am not on that type of contract. What does that even mean. I cancelled my mobile phones last year due to overpayment. BT customer service are rude and unhelpful. I will be cancelling my account when the contract expires.

121189,"FOOD DID NOT ARRIVE

Food ordered, driver tracked via the website (restaurant is about five minutes away), then when driver arrived a street away he marked the order delivered but never actually delivered it. Deliveroo's customer service couldn't understand that having to re-order food and wait another hour or so was an inconvenience to the customer. I can only presume that their business model factors in pissing off a certain percentage of their customers. . . . and now I'm one of them."
116711,"Why did I not look at the reviews on here?? But then again, most broadband / TV service providers just seem to be totally hopeless. I can forgive complications in such a complex world, but when you seek resolution of the same problem four times from customer services, and you just get the same answer to a question you did not ask, then there comes a time to give up.
I also looked at the customer forum pages for an answer, and saw that people were posting the same problem years ago, and could not get it resolved.
The issue - I have an account, which I purchased because there was a special deal on getting Now TV Entertainment pass for 6 months. To be fair, the switch over went well, no problems. So I then thought I would activate the 6 months pass. But I get an error message to say I have no payment details and then a page that says ""Oops, something went wrong"", which means I cannot update the details. I keep asking why this is happening, and I get told to go to the payment page to update my details!!! No one listens anymore, or they employ people in customer service who are just plain stupid.
OK, I have the basic broadband, so I will let that run its course, and just give up on getting the deal that was used to entice me in. Shame on Now TV, or Sky - but they have lost my custom, but I am sure they don't care, that is certainly the impression I get."

149972,"The choice is very good, and the prices are not too bad either, the delivery spoils it, I tend to wait until I have a few things I need before ordering, if I forget something I will do without or get it else where a £5 item turns into a £10 item and with the likes of other online stores I will get it off them for cheaper as a lot don't charge delivery,I myself would probably buy more if it was free delivery. Quality of the items I have bought is very good. The site is OK but could do with updating, you can't scan your card you have to do it manually, its also slow, and to view statements you have to go to track orders so it's confusing."

115595,"I bought a samsung fridge freezer online. The Fridge/freezer initially worked (although produced a lot of noise when it was running a cycle). The product stopped cooling and started making a loud ""whirling"" noise 31 days after it was delivered. It stopped working days before Christmas and I had to throw away a freezer full of produce and most of the products in my fridge. Curry's online return process was closed, and I could not get through to customer service. When I did get through to them (36 days after purchase) they would not take any responsibility for delivering a faulty product because it was outside the 28 day window of purchase (despite there being an extended Christmas return period) and will now only process a replacement/ refund if Samsung write the product off as ""outside economical repair"". This product has a 5-year extended warranty but 31 days of use and it requires rewelding, re-gassing, and a new compressor, and I am now stuck without a fridge/ freezer for 10+ days while I organize the repairs. Curry's customer service has not shown any empathy toward my situation and will not discuss an exchange or refund despite delivering a faulty product."

180353,"This is by far the worst experience I have had in purchasing any product. I’d waited months to be able to upgrade my new phone and an experience which should be exciting was instead awful.

I understand it wasn’t nearing the end of the day on Sunday but I went in and told the sales exec the phone I wanted, not only did he pressure me into taking a phone which was different (I presume they get paid more on this phone) but was also more expensive.

I was unsure of moving away from my current provider yet he assured me I had my 14 day cooling off period to think about it, swiftly handed me a tablet to sign on without any sign of the terms and conditions - foolishly I trusted him. Having spoken with my current provider the week after I decided to stay with them and went back into carphone warehouse store within the next 2 days to be rudely told, I was not entitled to a 14 day cooling off period due to purchasing in store!!!

There was no sympathy from the store manager or no apology as to why I was lied to and uninformed of this - having known this beforehand I would never have signed into a contract. I was advised to ring the customers services number, which I did twice, to again be rudely told - there is nothing they can do and I needed to go back into store again.

I contacted carphone warehouse two weeks ago regarding this and I am still awaiting a response!

Absolute disgrace."
189687,"Well this is the second review a few weeks ago I requested an item to be delivered and was offered a Sunday service. Well when it did not arrive though I put in a complaint Carphone Warehouse could not careless. I spoke to the delivery company after they received the poor review and admitted the driver was at fault took full responsibility and refunded the delivery costs back to Carphone Warehouse.
Well have I heard from Carphone Warehouse no not a thing and they are quids in as the carriage has been refunded what a rubbish company to deal with"

195145,"Well where to start, the service received in the shop in long Eaton was outstanding.
The best thing about the experience was I knew what I wanted and the sales person didn't try to sell me something I didn't want as soon as I had chosen my phone we sorted out the terms of the contract and got it all sorted. Got what I wanted with no hassles and no push sales pitches and add ons that I didn't require."

Facebook
Twitter
Email
Telephone
NOBODY IS ANSWERING ME.

The customer service telephone line actually hangs up on you after telling you to go and read the FAQs on the website, which I think demonstrates a disgraceful lack of respect for customers. It is possibly some of the worst customer service I have ever received.

I am STILL waiting for a response from them."
134472,Communication! We are often all disappointed with the Customer Service e receive. NOT with this company. They were GREAT! Nothing to much trouble. Very impressed with them and my new vacuum which is Brill !

They also refused to refund me for their mistake until I returned the equipment

Do not do it"
186929,"My service with Now Broadband went live in January 2021. Before I signed up I asked if they had any relationship/connection to Sky to which they denied. Sky is their parent company! I wanted to avoid any affiliations with Sky so I feel that lying to me was for just one purpose - to get my business. It's a relationship I regret! After an acrimonious break up I told Nowtv.com (Sky) where to shove their Broadband. During the short time I was with them I had to threaten them with with legal action because they sold my ex-directory number to cold callers. I wrote to them to hold them in breach of contract because they were constantly deleting my payment card details which put me in debt 4 times. It is not possible to make Online payments nor set up a direct debit. Which brings me to their customer service - rather their very rude and mostly abusive customer service. They slander you, they make false allegations against you, they cut you off, they yell at you, they pretend not to be able to speak or understand English, this list is as long as your two arms with the problems the staff cause you. They seem to have a irresistible urge to rudely interrupt you and then accuse you of speaking over them. They are grossly incompetent (I called a member of staff that and he demanded I don't use such profanity!) If you're thinking of taking up a broadband contract with them then think again! Remember cheap is not necessarily cheerful in Now's case it's CHEAP AND NASTY! Very nasty. You'd do better going elsewhere. Beware of this despicable company as they will test your nerves and your patience. In summary: NOWTV/NOW BROADBAND IS NOT RECOMMENDED. I wouldn't wish this company onto my worst enemy - You have been warned!"

122610,What can I say only everything they say on the Web page
181464,"I placed an order (MPD101423930) and was informed by DPD that it had been delivered, with a photo showing it in a publicly accessible area. However, upon arrival, I found that the phone was not there. Mobile Direct advised me to contact Three to block the phone, which I did and shared a reference number.

Despite this, I have been disappointed by the way Mobilo Direct has handled this situation. They have been passing the responsibility back and forth between them and Three. As a partner of Three, I expect them to work together and resolve this issue.

After over 30+ calls and many emails, the team continues to pass the responsibility and has been unprofessional in their communication with me. I have been deeply disappointed by this experience and hope this is helpful for you


In addition, police have advised that Mobile Direct is responsible and a simple GPS match can not prove the delivery and when DPD say they deliver with customer present, please show a picture not a fake signature

Be advice that if anything happen, Mobio Phone Direct will kick you like a football"

121069,"See previous review posted one week ago.
Well here we are again with yet another negative review on a company that fails to act in response to its its short comings and remains fixed and intransigence in its stance when faced with complaints from customers.
Having previously ask for a voucher issued when
I sold a perfectly good Apple IPod touch, the exchange resulted in my being give a faulty iPod classic and although they agreed to take it back and my having asked for the voucher to be converted to a lesser value cash equivalent the request was refuse by the company saying it has to stick by the original transaction ( why? When they cannot meet their end of the obligation )
Thus you are forced into being locked into continuing to trade with a company you have lost confidence in.
Against my better judgement I ordered another iPod silver in colour since the said they no longer had black, the item arrived on the 30th Dec and surprise, surprise the colour was black the invoice said silver!
Yet again I contacted the the company and pointing our their short comings, in return they were full of apologies saying the would correct the the situation to simply return it and all would be well!
I returned their email and told them the replacement item did work and was the colour I originally wanted and I would keep it my intention was to change the companies view point that their stance on vouchers should change, the reply as predicted was absolutely not it should stand ( even if they are wrong ) I have tried my best to alter their skewed vision on what is right the have tunnel vision.
The parting shot was to tell me the has sourced a silver iPod in their Bradford store that according to the manager works perfectly fine!!! ( as did the very first manager ) and should I wish, I should pop into the store with the receipt and exchange it….. I live in Renfrew SCOTLAND now absurd.
Shop elsewhere there are are good companies out there that endeavor to maintain good customer relations.
That is exactly what I will be doing"
188667,"We were very impressed, ordered on the Friday evening and our order arrived Monday morning, and well packed. Would buy again from this company."
135967,"I upgraded my Samsung phone in store - Perry Barr, Birmingham on 8th August, great no problems. They had a promotion where you buy 3 items and they are discounted, so I had the screen shield, (which I definitely wanted), phone case, and was encouraged to have the wireless charger, which I was reluctant to have. When I got home, I realised in the phone box it has 2 additional adaptors that can be used for charging, so I did not really need the wireless one. I went straight back to the Store, only to be told that only the Manager can authorise an exchange, but he left early, so advised to come back the next day.

I went back on the 9th August, and met with 5 workers in the Store, 3 of whom were on their own phones. One worker - Nigel was very helpful once I told him the situation, however, another worker (one of three on their phones), said that they could not exchange as the item was part of a promotion and I would need to return all three. I told him how can I return all three when one of them (Screen Shield) is on my phone. Ridiculous. He was adamant and just shrugged his shoulders and said there is nothing they can do, but I can speak to the Manager, but he's not there as he had to leave in an emergency, or I can call Head Office. Nigel called them on my behalf, but unfortunately, unable to get through. Nigel tried again to see if he could exchange the item, but this staff member kept going on and on being belligerent and rude, and still continued to play on his phone. However, Nigel cracked it and was able to do the exchange, but this staff member was the only one who could go in the till and give my refund once I had my exchange (item was less that the wireless charger). He did not apologise and give no explanation why he couldn't do this in the first place.

I will not be going back to the Perry Barr shop and I have told my family and friends of this experience who have also said they will not be going back. Some of the staff need training in customer service, code of conduct, etiquette and efficiency."
160046,"Rubbish, having technical problems as nothing seems to play, tried on tv, laptop and tablet....no customer service department to contact and their Facebook messenger is rubbish, just a bot....I will cancel and never renew again."

So did but didn’t go to plan.was not easy to do on the phone and ended up mistaking imputing and it defaults to delivery. Told the shop straight away as was in town all the time trying to arrange collection. They had to wait till HO changed it.

107933,Great company. Just bought a new laptop from them. My old PC Specialist laptop is still going strong after 7 years but is just beginning to slip in performance where the graphics card is concerned! I can’t recommend them enough for reliable custom machines with decent long term support.
154717,"Absolutely awful! Joined for a sim only plan. its been 5 weeks, no sim. They have charged us for a month. Claimed they tried to deliver it ONCE in the last 5 weeks. Offered us £5 off our next bill. What absolute ""can't say it here"" C***'s"
129817,"Best selection of christening cards I could find on the internet & at such a great price! Really helpful to have the suggested wording & superb quality when it arrived.
The only addition it would make would be to the wording for the RSVP & that would be to suggest people provide their dietary preferences (I did this when I realised I had a vegan attending) but others may find it useful for an RSVP to have the information in the reply."
162720,Had a care plan for washing machine and tried to cancel it. Person answered the phone was very rude and as if this is not his job or I was wasting his time. Avoid.

114053,one star is generous. dont sign up to free trials or trials that offer you a promotional rate of £5.00 . you will only be charged numerous amounts of £10.00 leaving your account with a robotic chat service that is the most unhelpful chat service i have ever encountered and a customer service line that disconects. i have been charged numerous amounts within 5 days of ever using this service with little communication methods to reach an agent. tp deduc the amounts you have is so unrealistic and not to mention the time of year where finances are crucial you just authorise any payments amount you want to from your customers without authrisation. complaint wil be raised and i want the funds back you have taken off your own accord . advice... dont use this service

The deal was amazing, i took the deal received a text from the phone spot ( this made me really confused ). Called carphoneware, the phone spot and o2 they said a order has not been processed, i was like what the person offered my a contact they said my upgrade was due on the 18th. They referred me to phonespot the person offered me the same contract but for less.

After calling and calling in my mind a upgrade wasn't made which was confirmed by carphonewarehouse/ phonesspot. i got a text from 02 stating my upgrade was made, when i contacted 02, they referred me to carphonewarehouse who told me to call the phonespot, when i called they said the phone is in the warehouse and will be delivered today.

I was in total shocked, i asked if i could change the colour because the individual forgot to ask me . The customer service lady informed me the iPhone was REFURBISHED which i didn't know, i decided to cancel the whole contract because the product the individual advertised was misleading.

Woke up this morning to see the order being delivered today when i called to cancel the order yesterday they should off left a note on their system to cancel the order and let it go out for delivery. Called back phonespot who have informed to refuse the order.

All i know is if i see a difference in my contact bill i will be taking this issue further, i have already made a two complaints to carewarehouse and phonespot. I don't understand how this issue has taken over a work to fix."

177145,Driver left dryer in reception hall. Staff had to chase after them and told them to deliver it to correct address. Not a pleasant experience for them. They did the exact opposite to what is stated on your statement of delivery. Which stated you would never leave any delivery outside.
195395,"I visited Watford carphone warehouse yesterday enquiring about a new contract. The person I spoke to Jason told me about a Samsung phone which will cost £24 a month contract for 2 years. He wrote down some details the last line was the hand set was free. When I questioned him this he admitted that part of the £24 includes cost of the handset. We argued about his definition of 'free handset"". I thought that was false representation and he was breaking the law.

I left feeling disgusted with his underhand selling"

And in while doing so they made a mistake of having a shortage of RAM I've picked but instead of going forth to replace it with something worse, they installed one that is a genuine upgrade! I can't stress enough how many times I got their computers and had one picked up from Amazon after years of its warranty being ended but they still had support for it and we're happy for me to open and diagnose what could be the problem! I will continue getting products from these guys they know what they're doing!"

Couldn't speak to anyone i could actually hear (all sounded like they were stood in a crowd) and when you do they are utterly useless.

165442,"They do not take scammers off their website- avoid if you cannot afford to loose money.

We put up a bark and were unfortunately scammed. The cleaner cancelled the clean and made platitudes to have returned the money when it hadn’t. Whilst Bark doesn’t vet their professionals, I have emailed them to make them aware of the fraudulent service. However, instead of further investigating or taking the fraudulent service off their site, their response was that they will not do anything as it’s the clients responsibility to vet the professionals and they will not intervene between agreements made.

This is a shame as it undermines the credibility of their website and leaves clients vulnerable to fraud.

If you have fallen prey to a fraudulent service, do consider contacting Citizen’s Advice and your bank. These are agencies who will take action unlike Bark."

It left in perfect condition, no scratches, damage etc. but then I receive an email to say they had reduced my offer by £40 as there were more than 3 visible cosmetic scratches. Not a chance. I requested photos which show multiple scratches although there was not a single scratch before I sent it? (I took plenty of pictures) Needless to say I have rejected the offer and now waiting for my phone to be sent back. Staff over emails are rude and unhelpful. Absolutely appalling service DO NOT USE MAZUMA!"

Also, they put your monthly payments up without telling you - went from paying £25pm to £42! Stay clear."

181929,"Hi, I would just like to say a big thank you to the 'WEX' Store in Newcastle. It was such a breath of fresh air to be able to walk in and see a wide choice of both new and used quality cameras. All camera's were operational and on display for the customer to view. Phil Ryott, the sales consultant in particular, was exceptional. He new his stuff. Very knowledegable and helpful. Not at all pushy. He allowed us to browse and ask so many questions especially when we weren't looking to buy that day, and he still gave up alot if his time for us. We felt so relaxed in that store. It's clear from my experience that all WEX staff are experts in their field, and show true customer service skills. I will definitely be returning when the time comes to purchase, and I know who to seek out. Thanks again 'PHIL RYOTT' for your time and expertise."
181652,Very knowledgeable and very easy to deal with. Ordered my items and delivered as described. If I had one criticism it would be that the deal I got could have been ordered online instead of having to order in store.
155871,Take a long time to delver and no on the time
111658,Have ordered several items from Gtech and cannot fault the company or goods. Very efficient. Could definitely recommend.

198927,My first bill came in at £62.88 which I found a little strange considering I signed up for a £34.99 package 🤔 I will be getting out as soon as I can.
126069,"Purchased LG American fridge freezer 27/6/20, told out of stock, will probably be delivered around 9 July.
Had 1 text message saying we'll be contacted to arrange delivery, no other texts or emails, NO DELIVERY DATE AGREED.
Sunday 5 July 9am, Know How turn up, I was in bed.
We hastily emptied the old fridge freezer, my husband hurt his hand trying to disconnect the electricity and dropped the electric cable out of reach, so he had to saw a hole in the kitchen cupboard to retrieve it – all because we were unprepared.
Staggered that the Knowhow delivery team wore no PPE, no covid protection, no gloves or masks, no wiping down surfaces and no social distancing. The Knowhow team drove off before we could tell them that we were satisfied with the appliance, we didn’t sign any delivery papers. Small scratch on the appliance.
Spent nearly 2 hours trying to get through to Curry’s/Knowhow customer care. Eventually did and reported the lack of covid protection, I was put on hold as the phone rep told me he contacted the Newark office to report this. In my anxiety about half an hour into the conversation I accidentally pressed the end call button. I expected a call back from Currys/Knowhow customer services (they had all my details), but nothing. I was also told that we would have to contact LG about the scratch – we purchased a care plan!
Curry's website full of promises about protecting customers when goods delivered....really?
After many attempts to call customer services, completing an online complaint form, sending multiple emails to various publicised email addresses and a visit to our nearest Currys, we still haven't heard from Knowhow (until today) - most emails bounce back as undeliverable. All we want is reassurance that they have put covid protection in place for all customers. Visited Currys - they gave us £85 for the scratch but no comment about Knowhow (not their responsibility). Curry's gave us an email address for Knowhow customer services, printed on an in-store leaflet - great! we emailed but it bounced back as undeliverable.
Today 31/7 received an email from customer services Knowhow saying our on-line complaint had gone to a Republic of Ireland email address so they can't comment, please ring customer services....ha ha ha. This is the most atrocious and frustrating excuse for a service we've ever come experienced."
113850,Send phone in for repair Face ID failure sent Apple report with phone with them with Apple saying full phone replacement required hardware failure sent away for week and half and told no fault and when phone returned the girls in store switched phone on and Face ID failure straight away so clearly never switched phone on or done anything now again another week and half with no phone all because they don’t want to uphold the customers warranty
191258,"The phone is in good condition, and the team understood my concerns and I received my phone quite quick than expected."
154521,Quickly found the spare parts I required which were sent to me on time. The only problem was that one of the parts was missing from my delivery but eSpares dispatched me the missing part when I emailed. Excellent customer service.
139948,"This is definitely on my list of providers to avoid . My Virgin contract came to an end in November .I gave notice in October by phone . Giving me the 30 days notice . However time ticked on without confirmation and I contacted again to ensure they knew and had a disconnection date given me . However as that approached I got another bill and no confirmation . I contacted again and they hadn’t processed my disconnection or had a record of it . I hit them with screen shots of my conversation etc . Finally got a disconnection . Now despite 2 attempts my returns package has failed to appear . I am now waiting for the 40 pound charge . Despite the fact I’m not at fault . I’ve cancelled my Direct Debit and kept the evidence of contact .

My advice avoid this lot …customer service contact is absolute useless . If you ring them they are rude and unhelpful ."

I now only ever use Envirophone because not only do they normally offer the most for your phone, but I have never not got the price quoted. always processed within 24 hours of receiving it and same day payments. Really great way to make some money, care for the environment without stress. Simple, accurate, fair. The best there is."

Shell Energy have never had a contract with me. I cleared my account with GOTO Energy in 2021, as a landlord. Shell Energy are hounding me and passed debt collectors onto me. I've been assured, twice, by Shell Energy that my contact details have been taken off system. But, Shell Energy still harass me, it's making me very sick. Seeking legal action now."

However, I then visited my local store around 6 months ago, were the staff were helpful and friendly, and assisted me in finding the right plan and upgrading my phone. They also took in my old phone as the deposit to get me a good deal. I would highly recommend, was also cheaper then going direct to the network ! 😀"

163435,There was a button to press for better quality photos for free. After clicking it they looked the same so I continued with the order but unfortunately the pictures on the calendar look underexposed and over saturated. I would have left this box unticked had they shown how the pictures would be altered.

124623,"Ordered a washing machine (Bosch) from Curry’s & paid for delivery, removal of old machine & installation of new one. Arrived today. ‘Team Know How’ don’t know how - in fact, they should be re-named Team Clueless. Said they couldn’t plumb the machine in as they couldn’t turn the tap under the sink. Left the washing machine in the middle of the kitchen & told me to call a plumber. They were there about 8 minutes - I thought they were supposed to allow up to an hour for installation? To add insult to injury, when I let the washing up water out of the sink, it poured into the cupboard below. I will be getting a plumber & Currys will be paying for it, in addition to refunding my so-called installation charge. Next time I’ll be going to John Lewis."

I have paid for netflix and paramount + and amazon prime but can get any because of these cowboys .
Of course I cant leave because ime tied in for 2 years so ime paying money for broadband that doesn't work and all the other companies for 2 years.
Might as well as thrown the money in the bin.
Crap crap crap do not go with these money making tosses, stick to petroleum."
177041,"Wish I read all these reviews before I decided to go with BT with broadband all I can say is what a complete shower of crap !! If you can’t deliver on a customers order then get your house in order first I never thought that such a big name like BT would behave like this
I decided to move from Vodaphone Fibre BB never had a problem been best provider ever but deceided to go with BT arrange for 15 th of Dec as this was my day off and no interruption to my supply but they changed to 16 th Dec and I would have been disturbed while working although had to wait weeks and my day off the 15 th , and they changed my date to 16 th because they can, but deceided to let it go
I work from home on the front line of Covid and I’m now been left with no broadband because openreach deceided to have me wait in all day and not bother to turn up no contact to cancel just like all other reviews and just escalated to a complaint tonight, no nothing, not even told whether be rescheduled or what action or whether I can continue to do my job let alone lose my daily income , since when as a company like BT become a shoddy service they promise everything But also false advertising false misrepresentation and no clear instructions what they can deliver so a complaint winging its way to the regulator

UPDATE … after making a complaint last night 16 th about no engineer turning up no services let alone not being told , I was told complaint made and adviser went through to open reach to escalate so woke up to no explanation as to anything !! But an email with a new engineer visit for 29 th Dec no apology explanation so I rang back to call centre at 12 pm 17th customer service adviser fobbed me off amongst all the laughing shouting and clapping going on in the background the adviser proceeded to put me on hold for yes 7 mins probably to drown out the noise of what sounded like a party in background telling me he was just locating my account details bearing in mind he had not even taken my name or account details then when he came back took my name and put me on hold again while he carried on with the very loud laughing in the background and clapping and just asked me what my problem was as I was being sent a mobile broadband to connect to and blamed Covid !! Don’t even go they when you work on the front line with covid from home and need your internet to work this was so unprofessional that I had to end call and escalate to Ofcom Complaint Ref 01398483 this has got to be worst customer service experience I have ever come across and today Ofcom made me aware of the compensation scheme which BT needs to start to address I did try to see if I could go to another supplier today and awaiting there response as the outfit I thought was very reputable has not lived up to expectation

And yes Dan 2 complaints now"
111395,"I ordered on a Wednesday, paying for next day delivery, being given an expected date for the Friday. The order was split, and I received 2 e-mails notifying of dispatch, one sent on Wednesday, one on Thursday. Thursdays had a tracking number; this arrived safely on the Friday. Wednesday's note had no details, nor was anything shown on my account. When it hadn't arrived on Monday, I contacted EBuyer, who had tracking details, and told me they had attempted delivery on Thursday; they hadn't as I was in all day. I was promised they would get onto it and tell me where the package had been taken - I am still waiting.
In the end, by asking neighbours I discovered a card with no details (save the post office location) had been left with them; as there was no name, order details or tracking number they were at a loss. I had to drive to the Post Office to collect; not the local Post Office either.
Whilst eBuyer are not responsible for Parcel Force's ineptitude in going to the wrong address, leaving a card with insufficient detail or taking the package to a remote village Post Office, they could have sent via a different courier, as per the rest of the order. Had they allowed the package to be left (no signature was required) or given me the tracking number they had, I could have collected the goods earlier; I had organised my week around having time for the upgrade over the weekend.
In the end I've paid twice for next day delivery and then in petrol costs for a service I didn't receive; customer services didn't not offer a refund.
I've been a loyal eBuyer customer over the years; I will consider others in the future."
189351,Very reliable. I ordered for x100v and received it within 2 weeks.

Very pleasant and helpful a pleasure to do business with. This is not my local branch, they didn't have any. The item turned up exactly when assistant said.So overall very satisfied with Richer Sounds Thankyou."
152861,"Product ordered and was delivered by Parcelforce next day, wasn't expecting it so quick. The price was cheaper than most and ordering and dispatch couldn't be faulted."
109393,"Photos arrived sooner than expected, very good quality prints well packaged to prevent damage."
155390,"Had to cancel broadband twice and still have no record of it being cancelled from them.

All they can say is the bill is valid and it won't be waived. I have no idea currently if I'll be billed yet again next month.

They suggested I pay or they'll only put further charges on the account.

Laughable really..."
190183,"I ordered a game for my son. The stated delivery time on the order was 4 days but I would get an email confirming this. To date I have had no email, no game and been told to call back after 48 hours 3 times. I have been rudely cut off by one of their so called customer care operators on the chat and totally ignored by the other. Quick to take my money but no response when things so wrong. Very poor. This is for my son, Should this not be dealt with it will be taken further."
159631,Very good and never had a problem with them so yer all in all very good

161987,"Everything is great. Only reason I have not given 5 stars, is that the delively was a day later than expected, and I need my computer for work. I had to change some things around to make it work."
182559,"I'm new at using a DAW to record and mix music for my band and there's so much to learn just to do this at a basic level. The instructions at Plug in Boutique are excellent.

131514,"Competitive prices, well built, good communication, works like a dream. What else can I say? Very happy I chose these guys."
107210,Everything went well from ordering my washing machine to delivery and installation. I am very happy with Currys and would buy again.
113607,Wish I could give 0 stars - this company literally lie to your face and steal money from your pocket. Since leaving them 5 months ago they've assured me that my account is closed and yet keep taking money - and then take more instead of refunding it! They are despicable; steer well clear. I shall be ringing once again to complain and demand adequate recompense and taking it up with the ombudsman too. They should be paying me for time wasted and stress!
127116,"I have a complete Sky package TV and Broadband and very pleased with Sky, great customer service unfortunately the broadband is very limited as I live in a village with very old telephone service.

I decided to return to Virginmedia just for the broadband, I signed up with Volt 2 contract which comes with 3 boosters if required, my previous contract with Virgin had three boosters, I installed it myself and then asked for the wireless boosters was informed you can only have one at a time with a 7day break ???

I was sent one booster and asked for a second one told it was on the way and after 5 calls to customer service explaining my problems it arrived, I should have learnt from my previous experiences with the call centre the service is dreadful. I am within my 14 days cooling off period of a new contract.

I have now made three calls trying to cancel my contract, and today was asked to call back in 24 hours, my concerns are I only have 2 days left to cancel, Virginmedia’s broadband is in no doubt the best in the UK, unfortunately the customer service support is awful and I will not accept this level of service, back to Sky 30mg,but brilliant and helpful call agents"
114857,"BT do NOT show any loyalty towards their loyal and long serving customers. They constantly lie, hound you and threaten you with nasty emails and letters. It doesn’t matter if you are a pensioner or are disabled, they will still bully you. They tell you that you have ended your contract early and that you need to pay cancellation charges otherwise they will send the debt collectors out even though you have never signed a contract. My mum and dad had been customers of BT since 1987 and have still had to pay to leave them. My dad is a pensioner and my mum is disabled and doesn’t need the stress. I will never recommend anyone goes with BT unless you want to be bullied or be told false information. You get several different answers from different BT agents in call centres all over the country. There are no definitive answers. You think your “case is closed” but then weeks later you get threatening emails. Stay away from these jokers and do not enter any “contract” with them otherwise you will be stuck in one and if you leave you will have to pay cancellation fees. You have been warned!"
165694,Items arrived promptly and well packaged.
161104,Fast service even though it was just before Christmas. Lovely products (photo book and fridge magnet) and good price. Website quite easy to use to build photo book.
148363,"Simply one of the worst companies i have dealt with in recent years. Didn't process an order and had to be chased. When they did process it, they did not despatch. When chased, they did not despatch to an amended address. They did not despatch the bext day or the next day either. No help on the phone, no proactive emails. An absolute shambles of a company who should be avoided at all costs. Save yourself some stress, pay a little extra and buy from a better company."
146558,"This is my second product from Gtech and very happy with my purchase. However my battery pack was faulty and after a quick phone call, I received a replacement within 2 days. The customer service is excellent. Very happy customer"

149981,"We ordered 90 hoover bags, three boxes of 30. We received 1 box of 30 x bags and 2 boxes of 10 bags. It was extremely difficult to get in touch with Argos to report the issue. The online help was useless. When we rang and explained the situation, the operator couldn't understand what the problem was. After several repeated (frustrating) conversations we were told we would receive a credit."
197442,"Sent engineer quickly, washing machine not able to be fixed so brand new machine ordered and fitted within a week. Able to get upgraded machine for small cost"

193187,"Ordered some food for my partner who is in hospital. The driver called me up and said “I’m outside you need to come out and get your order because I’m not coming into a place like that.

143627,"We built and ordered a budget gaming PC using your builder tool. The information on products, their pricing and compatibility were all readily available. Communication during the build, testing phase and delivery was excellent. We even had a free power unit upgrade as the one we initially ordered was out of stock. Would definitely recommend PC Specialist and would use you again in the future."
184989,"A month ago I decided to give NOW TV a try, today I cancelled my subscription.
The reason I subscribed to it in the first place was because they had HBO series that I was interested in, for starters Twin Peaks, but sadly the last season is streamed at a terrible quality, while all the other shows can be streamed just fine.
They don't have other HBO shows that I like, The Wire, Westworld, so that was disappointing.
Last, the app is so bad, both in PC and PS4, it feels outdated and difficult to use. It's not easy to browse the shows available, especially compared to other paid streamers.
Price/value doesn't make sense. Too expensive for what it is."

129828,"I have been using TalkTalk for almost 3 Years now and they don't cease to disappoint me, but this was the last one. I explicitly told you agent that I work from home and need connection to the internet, else I cannot work. So, I kindly asked if I could open a new contract to my new address while keeping the existing one. Instead, he disconnects me and cancel the move, speaking with them trying to reactive my account they told me is impossible, that I must wait 14 days to active my account in the new place, this is the second time TalkTalk do something like this to me.

First time they buy me out with 2 months free of charge and a Gift card, but not again instead of trying to give me money improve your customer service, how come you made the same mistake twice, back in March when I first move and again now."

Disappointed to learn that BT won’t do an account takeover so that my flat mate can take over my account to move it to another property with her. Only option for an account takeover is if the account holder is dead!!

Working for a broadband company myself - I know the way it should work and how it works well for customers and BT are not it.

Now left with a cancellation bill of over £140.

Wont be using BT in future"

Anyway, not happy with it as a lot of items still on the site but when you check out, items no longer available. I even want to pick them up from Edinburgh, kidding, just to check if items are available anywhere.
Please, if items are not available, remove them from your site, that is false advertising, or raising false hope when I though I could buy items I really liked.
Hope you will eventually improve your service."

129576,"Upgraded to 1Gb BB, been hell to setup although paid 35.00 for setup fee. Let's be honest here, the 35.00 is just an admin fee. Had trouble with new hub, agent next to useless, advised agent i will go back to old hub and speed to be told I have to give them 30 days notice. 14 days to change my mind is enshrined in consumer law, it trumps your policy and is designed to protect the consumer.
Tried today to check hub settings, hub password not recognised, not wifi password, hub password.
All i can say is, thank god the competition is getting closer, maybe then you will start to treat us as humans rather than numbers."
175744,My partner hasnt used the email he registered with in years. He is technophobe. We tried to uograde our broadband as it hasn't been done in many years but failed the email security stiff. We were told somebody from the executive customer service department would ring us within 5 working days …. 2 weeks and many emails later we are still waiting … now to cancel and move on to somebody else.
181005,"I originally ordered my BT around 6 weeks ago. I was told that it would be up and running in my flat in 2 weeks time. I was told that Openreach had pushed it back and this kept happening so I phoned to query this.

When I was on the phone on 3 occasions I was told I would be entitled to compensation as my service had been promised by a certain date. I'm currently unable to live there due to work requiring internet and I'm incurring large fees working, travelling and staying else where.

When I phoned again to get the compensation date I was informed I was entitled to nothing. The rep I spoke to clarified T&Cs which I understand is there job. When I said I was out of pocket due to their promises and mistakes, I was simply told there is nothing they can do.

It feels like BT have made me several false promises in order to keep my business. I would recommend if they say you need work done first to just looks else where. It's not worth the possible huge delay with no end in sight and no compensation for the issues occurred.

Regretfully write this after my Family and I have used BT for 20 years."
159396,"The photos were scheduled to arrive on the Friday, yet they finally arrived over a week afterwards.
The photos were also of poor quality. I was disappointed, since previous purchases from snapfish have been very good :("
147434,"I wouldnt even give it a star.

I ordered some pizza to be delivered to my house. The delivery told me to come downstairs, I told him I cant leave the kids alone.

8 minutes passed and still no driver, I was told the order has been closed and because I didnt collect my food im time, they said they will not be reimbursing me anything as a deliveroo plus member.

This is one of the worst places to order from. I have not received any compensation but it was the Pizza I wanted. The driver did not even leave the pizza in the concierge or anything.

This is an outrage! If I knew how to I would sue because this sort of behaviour is devastating!!

I deactivated all accounts and will never join again! Stay far away from this app as I cannot believe that they treated me this way after 7 years. Truly upsetting!!!!!"

I found the ones I wanted available on the app that evening and decided I would go for ‘A’ grade this time. They arrived fast and very well packaged for their journey to me, I appreciate the careful packing. They were fully complete and boxed how I wanted and in excellent like new condition. They are very much a professional/technical advance jump forward from my last ones too. Happy with them thanks 🔊🎧😁"
101661,"Completely and utterly lousy service.
They do not appreciate customer loyalty.
I have been with 3 for almost 20 yrs. They changed my plan to a more expensive one, without prior notice, to a plan where I no longer receive the free the feel at Home. Very shoddy practices."
121524,"Absolutely terrible service. I ordered a phone online and the website allowed you to a request a specific date for it to be delivered. I requested that it be delivered on 21 April. I then got an email to say it was going to be delivered on said date. 2 days later I received an email saying the phone was arriving the next day.

I called up and explained that I requested for it to be delivered on 21April as I didn’t want my contracts to overlap and have to pay 2 phone bills- they offered a £37 refund. The refund has not arrived a week later and I have called AGAIN to complain. The customer service team are very aggressive and rude. The lady I spoke to kept talking over me and shouting - not sure how they have people like her working as senior management. I order from Carphone warehouse every time my contract ends but this will be the last time. Such a shame that they don’t seem to care about all the negative reviews."

172121,"I have been with BT before and well, it was awful. Many years later I thought, given the very poor choices we have in the UK with 99% getting awful reviews, I would give BT another go. Amazingly, during the start up period, when you have the chance to pull out of the contract, the service was excellent. Now, three months in, the service is good, on till tea time. Every single evening, as soon as you sit down to watch your streaming site of choice, the same old buffering. Do a speed check on many different sites and we are getting just over seventy MBS and yet we have buffering and the higher the quality your watching, the worse it is. Come on, BT is the leading, oldest Telecoms company in the UK and we are well in to the twenty first century and still the internet, to all but the financial industry it pants. How are these companies allowed to get away with treating customers in this way whilst taking good money from them?"

162315,This app is very much interesting. It gives you the platform to do what you want to do. It's very easy and simple.
109879,"Decided to treat myself to a new gaming desktop. went for a custom build and after I'd made all my choices the site highlighted all the bits I didn't need or needed to change. Really easy process and very helpful notes. Hardest bit was choosing a case to put that would fit in my office and contain all the techy bits I wanted.

Constant updates on build progress followed and delivery was bang on time and very well handled. Packaging was excellent and product arrived in pristine shape.

Lots of handy e-mails about pre-set-up things and during set-up things I needed to do, with help on hand if I was struggling with anything.

Seamless, easy and stress free, not much more I can add."
117561,"Dishonest marketing. They tell you that they will upgrade your router for free, then they send you a bill that says Upgrade £0 and Activation Fee £35.
I would be less annoyed if I had £35 stolen from my pocket on the street.

101345,"Made the order, heard nothing for 7 days, contacted (alleged) customer support and didn’t hear anything back at all. The item did turn up a lot later than expected but not happy with lack of communication"
134337,"Further to my previous review i've now realised what BT are up to. As I have found a superior broadband package with a company called Box Broadband at a much more competative monthly cost I am restricted from leaving BT as they put me onto a new 24 Month contract and I will have to pay a hefty fee to leave at the present time. I wasn't aware of this as I do not feel it was made clear to me when I was told that they were offering me the opportunity to change to a better package. I became very suspicious when I was told, yet again, that a better package was available very shortly after I had agreed to accept the new one. It seems that they will keep doing this to keep extending the time left on the contract every time you call because it deters people from leaving and get a more competative package elsewhere. I see that they respond to these reviews by saying to ""contact us by other means to discuss the issue"" but how about them phoning me to discuss it so I can record their response. I bet they don't"

134139,"I was looking to sell them my old iPhone X, 64gb. It had been in a case the entire time I’ve had it, not even a single scratch and looked brand new. Everything had been checked over and wiped off the device and I was quoted £135.00.

Accepting this it was sent off and I had an email stating that the price had been dropped down to £50.00 due to the camera module needing to be replaced due to dust particles having gotten into it, stating that black dots would show up on photographs.

Firstly, what a load of rubbish. Never once had there been a problem and looking back through photos there was never once a blemish! Secondly I researched the part they would need to replace this and it’s no more than £20/£30.

Mint condition iPhone X devices can resale over £200.00. You could call that daylight robbery!

Don’t bother with Mazuma Mobile, take your business elsewhere! Looking at other reviews they use this excuse a lot!"

131107,"Absolutely disgraceful!!! Can't contact anyone a day of my life sorting out things for my 84 year old father in law!!!! Yes that's right 84 !!! Went into store at lakeside to buy credit for his pay as you go, he uses so little and came out with a 15 pounds per month contract that he does NOT need. I'm furious!!! And dealing with this company has taken me all day and it's still not resolved. Disgusting ethics by vidaphone you should be ashamed of yourselves as a company!!!!"
145216,"The company is doing nothing well, and without people like ASHA it would be doing a damn site worse. Left to the vagaries of the pathetic management you have you might as well shut shop and go home. You have no idea how to treat customers and certainly no idea how to address an email TO CUSTOMERS !!!!! using threats will not endear you, and produce a negative response, telling a former customer what he can and cannot do with his money is sheer arrogance. It is your fault that your billing department cannot respond in a timely manner when a customer has changed to a new supplier and you expect me to keep paying you and to pay my new supplier, you must be raving mad, and having gone down this road you expect to have a good report. However I am pleased to say that ASHA had the required skills and manner to sort the problem out,and it was a pleasure dealing with her. You need to employ a few more of her calibre, preferably in a management position."
185454,Wish I could give zero stars absolute the worst company with the most disgusting customer service! The chairs to my order where delivered and the table was lost and I was left chasing them for 2 weeks to find it or do something about it. Had to escalate it as a complaint before anything was done and it was another week before that was solved. For them to just refund me for it I purchased it in a sale. The item is still in stock but now back at full price. So for me to actually complete my order I have to pay more for it for a fault that wasn’t my own and told by customer service well prices vary and hung up on. Just the worst company I’ve ever dealt with.
124269,"What can I say, ordered matched pair of ram and an ssd and my order arrived the next day! Installed in the laptop in 30 minutes, boot times to Internet connection have dropped from 6 minutes to less than 50 seconds so I’m a very happy bunny!

193835,"I've ordered online before and Wex have always been great. This time I went into the Manchester store and they were equally as good.

Phoned up and they put a lens aside for me. When I came to collect it everyone was super friendly and the person serving me helped me with a polariser and spent time chatting with me."
130569,"Delivered two days after ordering, great service!"
140778,The product was exactly as advertised and compatible with our DeLonghi coffee machine. Delivery was within the expected delivery window
155564,"3 have changed for the better, since they swindled my wife out of a considerable amount of money, for a useless account.
Now, the problem is the rubbish signals.
Although the charges are not too bad,(At the moment), we shall have to change network, because of these continual signal problems."
112812,Worked first time easy to install and delivered very promptly ordered in afternoon and delivered following day very pleased with service.
180591,"Product exactly how described and a great price. However, paid for express next day delivery and it was finally delivered 3 days later. Company should not offer express delivery if this service cannot be fulfilled."
117044,"Was not sure about using PCS, but I must say I have been very impressed. Cheaper than their competitors, built faster than they said, very tidy build and arrived with an OC graphics card which I was not expecting!
Communication has been excellent throughout the order process.
Would have no hesitation recommending PCS."
151683,"Do not take a contract out with NowTV. Disgusting customer service, have no idea what they are doing and the service is crap. We were paying £21.01 from the day we signed up and then for some reason 4 months later a payment didn’t come out. Rang up to make the payment and we were told we had to start paying £25 a month because someone their end put the contract down wrong. £4 is not a lot but when it’s not your fault and they laugh down the phone and say we are being ridiculous there is an issue. I believe we spoke to a man called Dylan and his customer service is shocking. We had to ask to speak to his manager which he was reluctant to agree to. The manager did credit us for one bill but this wouldn’t have happened by just speaking to Dylan as he didn’t want to help us at all. Avoid at all costs."

1000mbps service. We have a lot of gadgets and everyone of them works like a dream. In their favour they have never refused to send an engineer out and they troubleshoot everything to get it right. We stream a lot of Netflix, Prime and Youtube and there is never a sign of a buffer. I expected some problems of the system slowing because of Xmas traffic but as yet nothing to report. Who needs SKY with their extortionate monthly premiums"
120342,Excellent service on FB Messenger by BT's Theresa. She answered my questions and was very helpful generally.

185011,"1.5years in and I am still waiting for my referral reward!
After multiple follow-ups and spending hours at a time on multiple chats and calls BT has still not given me my referral bonus as they promise. Feels like they run a ponzi scheme.
On top of this, the Internet drops several times during my meetings.
The customer service sounds very helpful and make you feel like they are doing something about your issue but nothing comes out of it.
Shame on them!!"
170836,"I generally don't write reviews but I am so fustrated and dissappointed at the the service I have received form both Samsung and Carphone Warehouse I feel compelled to write this summary of my recent experience.
Who knew.... you can buy a Samsung phone from Carphone Warehouse, that is still in its warranty period and they are under no obilgation to get it working! Unbelievable I know, but true!
My Samsung A40 has an intermittant problem that means it turns itself off for days at a time and nothing can be done to turn it back on, a 'soft reset' occasionally works but generally it is dead, only to spring back to life at some point several days later. It has now been back to Samsung and Carephone warehouse 3 times, it is there at the moment, being repaired for a 4th time. Each time it comes back, after a few hours or sometimes days the problem reappears, it is throughly unusable, I have spend to many hourstrying to transfering data between this and an old phone and have lost numerous text messages and call log data over the last couple of months.
I was under the misaprehension that after the 3rd effort at a repair they would simply give me a refund or just give a new phone that worked... but alas no. I was told by the Currys Branch Manager at 'Currys Carephone Warehouse' in High Wycombe that I would have to keep sending it back for repair until they repaired it correctly. So I ask him what would happen if they were never able to repair the phone?... in around 6 months my warranty would run out, what would happen then? I was told that I should have taken out insurance, because after the warranty runs out they would not repair it!
Just so you fully understand, that means that although my phone wouldn't have been worked for around 9 months, the majority of which time if would hgave been with the repairers, once my warranty runs out there is nothing I can do... they are under no obligation to actually get my phone working, just go through the process of trying to repair it until my warranty runs out and then there is nothing more that I can do.
I am staggered, amazing, shocked, fustrated that this is allowed to happen. What is a warranty actually for? As far as SAmsubng and Carphone Warehouseare concerned, it means - we don't need to actually get your phone working just go through the steps of trying to repair it until the Warranty runs out',then is nothing the custoimer can do.
Shocking poor service, both Carephone Warehouse and Samsung hold your heads in shame."
168741,"Mobile phones direct gave me a cheaper 3 deal than my provider 3 were able to provide 😁 so I have a new phone cheaper than I was paying with the £35 pay as you go unlimited sim!
so far so good 👍
I was skeptical due to the other less positive reviews mainly around delivery issues- However the website is clear there are delays with different phone colour choices (in this day and age with phone cases you can switch things up anyway!) I got the Samsung galaxy s21fe in olive green and it was delivered the next day! I wanted the white but this may have taken a week or 2 more, so it was my choice!
My plan had no upfront cost, so I am yet to receive the bill later this month. Thry are very good at emailing you to keep you updated and are very transparent the first bill may be a little higher for the extra few days"
175362,"Unfortunately not been the best experience from PC specialist this time. It’s my 4 order with yourselves and I’ve never had a problem. Firstly my keyboard came defective which was ok, I had to pay to post it back which is ok, what was not ok was I had to ring three times to get you to send my replacement out. Another issues is with the build it’s self for the money I’ve payed for a top end system I would expect all checks and quality assurance where done , I can’t say that it was . I’ve been back and two which technical issues since I’ve got my system and need to call today to set up a remote tech session to get to the bottom of the issue. I work in IT myself and I understand the challenges you will face but I don’t think process was followed correctly has I have no doubt you will have that nailed down really disappointed, I was excited for my build and was really let down this time."
128134,Disappointing Record pretty badly damaged and was clearly sent out like that and not checked as packaging was fine. Customer service helpful though
143383,The experienced member of staff was very helpful as I was enquiring about mobile phone insurance and had my details up in no time at all
119729,"After a lost delivery, I had to contact Very several times to follow this up. Several messages via online chat were sent and a complaint logged. Very closed my complaint after trying to call me once, with no outcome. I then call back an agreement was made. This was not followed through which resulted in another telephone call. Poor customer experience.

No request for information has been received from Very. They are not sincere about correcting the issues."

I cancelled a new service for my mother in law the day after the order, she's 87 and didn't want to pay for the internet. They still put the order through, I e mailed, phoned cancelled the direct debit and sent 2 letters to Salford, all ignored. They put a restriction on her line and she couldn't use her phone until 86.00 was paid and now want 169.00 for an early exit fee of a service that should never have been theirs. I have complained and will take it further"
121707,"If I could rate 0 stars, believe me I would. I upgraded my wifi plan, and suddenly my wifi became really bad. Working from home became impossible. A phone call every day to either be fobbed off, make random excuses, transfer my phone call or act like they can’t hear me when I can hear them breathing down the mic and hear my voice echoing on their side. The worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. It seems as though they’re trying to ignore my wifi issue until the 14 day cooling off period is over so then I’m stuck with this silly contract with wifi that doesn’t work. The biggest scam of a company I’ve ever seen!"

Having finally got round to completing the puzzle, we were disappointed to find that 6 pieces were missing, which has ruined the whole thing. We were planning to display the puzzle in a frame. Having contacted Snapfish in regards this issue, I was simply told there was nothing they could do. I am not happy about this, particularly given the price of the puzzle. Puzzles take time to complete! Having been a regular customer of Snapfish for many years now, the response received was even more disappointing. I would NOT recommend ever ordering a puzzle from here at all and it does put me off ordering anything else from them too."

If it was an Indian call centre scam and I lose all my money I still give 5* (joking,the threemyview I accessed via laptop for the deal was genuine and it's technology helped immensely as did Milind who was outstanding with this testing matter and will appreciate the humour, excellent throughout),I look forward to my SIM arriving and new contract deal,which only took 1hr and 3 minutes including Dua Lipa starting over everytime you get up the hold queue you'll hear me baby......
SIM turned up next day, didn't seem to work,nobody could find account... don't panic people,the SIM and account was activated around 8 hrs after insertion and fine tuning my details was easy,as was disabling the automatic adult filter,which confused me as suddenly innocent sites refused to work.
Network not great but cheap deal.
Update your address lookup database......."
114136,great turnaround time and product as described
169498,"Don't see how it could have been better. Cost wasn't extorsinort, delivery speedy, and part fitted perfectly."
164422,"Great customer service, fast and efficient. Found a deal and within 24-48 I’m set up using my new phone."
117741,"Fine broadband at 100mbps for 26 p/m but the customer service is abysmal. It is such a chore if you need to cancel, there's no way to do it online, I couldn't get the online chat or texting service to work so I had to call. Getting them to stop asking for info about my new provider was like pulling teeth. I was told I'm not making a smart choice, that they're the fastest ect ect ect. Why must it take so long just to refuse to sign up for a new contract? Been on the phone for over 30 min now.Also he kept saying I had a beautiful voice which made me so uncomfortable.

The WiFi also never reached to the end of our house so we had no wifi in the bedroom. And I live in a small flat!"
115945,Delivered on time and all packaging taken away neatly.
117017,Superfast and free delivery of my new dishwasher. Happy with the dishwasher too. Quiet and I love the cutlery rack at the top.

No outage whilst working from home great speeds"
175180,"Talktalk customer service couldn't get any worse. I have been left without internet now for an entire week after a 'fault' their end. After informing them immediately, and being advised a case manager will get back to me after 3 days, I am still waiting to have a response. Tired of chasing them up, and being given unreasonable responses. This is not acceptable when people work from home and rely on internet. Will be cancelling immediately."
165947,"Fast delivery, really good value for money - will definitely use again!
The website was easy to navigate and lots of choice for birthday party invitations."
155230,"Tried to order a £8 a month sim card on line for my son. They ran a hard credit check without informing me they would and then rejected my application for failing a credit chech despite me having a credit score of 984. Absolute embarresment of a company. I appealed the decision and they retracted the initial decision but have left a mark on my credit for a sim card that was worth £96. Pathetic company would never use now. Incidently, went to ASDA mobile and got sim on same network for much cheaper with no hassle,"
108150,"AVOID

the WORST network ever.

Did ask for send me my last bill by email xxxxx @GMAIL.COM

I been told by customer service , that they can't send on any GMAIL and i need to have different email (other than gmail)

I dont have second email so they have no way to send, i can PAY my self for get by post ."
188645,Very fast delivery. I love that you can pay for items in three instalments.
107460,"Bought a Sky Sports Day Pass, although pricey, thought it would be the best way to enjoy the final day of the Premier League season. Utterly disappointing, choppy video, ruined the day."
164946,I like the parcel but the state it was delivered was absolutely horrendous the packaging was all damaged and ripped.
102840,Good batteries great service. Always buy my phone batteries here .
170629,"Was a little disappointed with my ps4, it was filthy with grime, dust and some sticky residue on the top, but it was delivered quickly , packaged well and it works fine , but overall I was happy with it. Maybe next time though il just buy from the cex store"
150305,Deliveries are quick and the batteries I use for my cameras are excellent.
135305,The help given by Chris at the Liverpool store was brilliant we spent over two and a half hours reviewing speakers and amps and found the perfect pair. All the staff here are so helpful. Thanyou
115856,Fast delivery!! I loved my product.
146076,"The day before the go live date, I still hadn't received equipment. So I checked the order status which was inexplicably cancelled. They never sent any communication of why the order was cancelled or that it was cancelled at all.
Turns out they had nothing in place to highlight that a technical issue had caused the cancellation. So that is why aparantly I received no notification of the cancellation. Vodaphone also claim they do not get notified (Even though they cancelled the contract) Hmm.
Result is being put back into the queue for an engineer and no internet for at least another week. No way out of it, and made to feel punished by a company that knows nothing of what is going on.
Bad omen from the get go. So went with someone else."
144920,"The worst retrieval and initiation system I have experienced with any app since Cubase 30 years ago.
Advice - start thinking from users pov and test out your clever ideas with average users."
131139,I found the part very easily and ordering was fine. It was delivered quickly. The only fault was it was very stiff plastic and I found it hard to put on my vacuum. However I am managing with it.
187463,An absolute joke! Manager Hannah at the Blackburn office is a disgrace to the company.

182633,"We got a quote on carphone warehouse website to sell our old phone. Phone was like new and in great condition, sent it off as requested.
We didn't hear anything for two weeks and my partner eventually phoned them, we were told they had the phone and the money would be paid with five working days.
We called back again when still no money a week later, after repeated phonecalls from us to them where we were told the money would be in shortly someone then decided to tell us the phone had screen burn so would not be paid. THERE WAS NO SCREEN BURN WHEN THE PHONE LEFT OUR POSSESSION.
MY partner asked to speak to the relevant department or manager, was told he would get a call back within 48 hours, never got this call. Over a week later the phone arrived back through our door, completely out of charge and with damage to the screen.
Carphone warehouse are absolute scam artists, we had heard similar stories but thought it couldn't possibly be true, it was.
We now have a damaged phone that we can no longer sell. They are a joke of a company."
102568,"After my last review on Team know How and the appalling service I received, I got a phone call from a very nice manager and have received friendly,polite and professional service since until today. Jack was extremely rude with a terrible attitude and kept talking over me. He also hung up on me. Hardly the type of service one expects. Would after todays experience NOT be recommending this company."
134715,"My laptop arrived brilliantly packaged and on time. I have always just bought a laptop from a store before but took a chance choosing something from Pcspecialist, best thing I could have done. The quality is brilliant the graphics are incredible and the speed after my old tortoise, well no comparison. Thank you to everyone at Pcspecialist brilliant job I am more than happy. Brian."

168323,"My order got Cancelled by the ""system"" which no one can explain. went to the store, they said to go online as I have ordered it online. Called helpline, advised to go to the store, explaining further they did not have a clue. I want my time and money back, please. Never going to enter a carphone warehouse."
141029,"very poor and money grabbing.
Spent around £3000 on a workstation build. A small £10 part was defective (LED strip). This should of been checked before dispatched. I assumed it was checked so spent hours trying to get it working.. it was broke.
I had to jump over hurdles sending photos of the issue in order to receive any acknowledgement of the fault.
I was told a replacement would be sent out next day. Nothing arrived. chased with a call a couple weeks later. 30mins on hold.
Turns out the item was no longer in stock and no contact was made..
As I wanted to get the PC back together & rebuilt I instead requested a refund on the single £10 LED strip.
For this to occur I was required to fully remove the LEDs and post the item back (meaning removing fans and many other parts).

This has completely taken the shine off one of the biggest purchases I have ever made.

In total I spent around 8hours trying to solve this problem. Wasn't met half way even after spending x300 times the cost of the small part.

I dread to think of what would be required if a larger more expensive part fails.

This should of been checked before dispatch."
155196,"My unit was repeatedly showing an error code since it had arrived just before Christmas, but a call to the service centre today provided me with advice which I followed, and my dehumidifier has been running since. So thank you for the kind advice and attention - it's much appreciated. Excellent service!"
101940,"My 3 year old Samsung TV developed a fault ( no picture) contacted RS customer service, TV was collected 2 days later. 5 days later I was contacted by RS, TV was beyond economical repair ( NOT GOOD SAMSUNG ) received Voucher from RS original price paid less 30% as per 6 year warranty agreement. Ordered new TV received 2 days later. FANTASTIC SERVICE RS GREAT PRICES AND GREAT SERVICE!!!"
161857,"Been with 3 for 15 years, been upgrading in the area. Had terrible signal and no internet services for 9 days now. Calls keep cutting out, Wi-Fi calling not working. Got in touch and told to reset network settings which worked for a few hours and now terrible again.
Well done three for picking the most festive time of year to complete upgrades. If no improvement I will be taking my four contracts elsewhere for breach of service"
130913,Every thing happened as we was told . Great service .
132735,Well informed staff which made choosing the right TV for me so much easier. They were helpful and could answer all our questions. The range of good quality TVs and delivery options were good
118288,"All members of the customer support team I was transferred to couldn't have been more rude if they tried. I had to go to my local store in the end who were the complete opposite, extremely helpful, couldn't do enough for me.

You need to look at employing people who actually care and will go that extra mile to help customers not make them feel like they are being insulted."
101574,"Always had good service from Ebuyer. Have used them many times in the past and will continue to do so. My order arrived on the day specified, in perfect condition and well packaged."
173497,"Really poor service. Lots of confusing communications and missed appointments, eventually told us they couldn’t repair the appliance within their price and they had cancelled the contract. Then the next day the engineer turned up again but didn’t know what for."
123609,Excellent service! I have purchased a number of items from Wex and have always been impressed with the quality of the products they sell and the wonderful customer service they provide.
114747,Now TV entertainment- Charges almost as much as Netflix but only get tv shows. And yet you get bombarded with ads!! And the same bloomin adverts over and over again. Complete rip off. Also they love taking of shows they hold rights to and withold them till new season is out then give you a short time to watch them again. Terrible service. Everyone should boycott.
107198,Excellent service. Fast turnaround both with sending packing envelope and then paying for my trade in. The whole process of selling my phone was made very easy.
182823,"Constantly getting connection issues and the quality keeps dropping to low res potato level every now and again for no reason. Tried in 3 houses, same issues! The interface is also incredibly poor if you're streaming on PC. Then there's the ""diversity"" brigade nonsense shoved in your face constantly. Terrible experience."
147273,"customer service very helpful,phone and fibre very good prices never had any connection problems in 10 yrs +"
141587,"Good quality PC, but only just started setting it up for our use. Order process and pre-sales configuration advice very helpful, recommended."
153198,"Fast delivery,and it works perfectly.Thank you"
182604,"Charlotte sorted an issue immediately. But what is surprising is that this was an ongoing issue for months and, on the face of it, it seems it could have been fixed much sooner."
154630,"Very efficient service, good communication and exceptional price. Would definitely use again."
128196,"Really poor experience. Having been a customer for a really long time, when I changed banks recently my card payment failed to update and when the system tried to take my subscription amount it didnt go through. I added a new card manually within 2 or 3 minutes, but regardless they cancelled my account and removed the special offer I was on. When I eventually got through to someone (they do not make this easy, with any phone or email support deeply hidden in a labyrinthine menu) I explained that payment had been updated but I still couldnt access my account. They said it had automatically been cancelled, and any special deal I was on was lost. No attempt made to try to help and ultimately they have lost a customer. I was already at the end of my patience with it to be honest, with the poor app, and the constant need to keep signing in/security checks- if you literally spend too long making a cup of tea it will sign you out! Unlike Netflix- I cant remember the last time it asked for my password. Now Tv makes you feel like you are not trusted, not a nice experience."
150683,"Unable to write a review as item purchased has not been in use yet. Speed of delivery was supersonic.
Well impressed."
179210,"Excellent advice and service received once again from Richer Sounds in Reading. The service was second to none. Steve the Manager talked me through several options and offered good advice, which helped me reach a decision. The delivery arrived on time just three days later.
A very satisfied customer."
131002,Next day deliver easy to order absolutely no problem.
157180,Any problems contact them. Couldn't be more helpful. I pointed out an issue it was immediately acknowledged and rectified. But was also rectified so the same mistake couldn't be made again An enjoyable pleasant purchase and communication throughout
113048,Gorgeous as always. Great quality
198316,"Good experience at Airport Park, Coventry store"
164802,This travel hairdryer is better than my regular hairdryer
163422,Cancellation is a NIGHTMARE. Website will purposely make it appear that you have cancelled when you have not and will continue charging you beyond your request to cancel. Their chat and customer care is shocking. They just end conversations abruptly so no opportunity to resolve. Sneaky money grabbers. Avoid!!!!
126597,"Im back to complain again.

TAKE IT IN . I AM ON HOLIDAY I WILL SEND THE BOX BACK WHEN IM HOME


Emma- iv been in contact. Not one person is listening to me"
124631,"Very simple-to-use service, automatic parts compatibility checker and great customer service. Highly recommended if you want a gaming PC but don't want to do any of the work (they also take care of the initial OS, driver, etc. setup and stability testing)"
104703,First time used marks electrical can honestly say i was very impressed with the ease of ordering and the prompt delivery and not forgetting the best price around.will definitely use again.
155330,"I went to shepherd bush westfield branch,I was with 3 12 years because of them I not with 3 anymore,I bought something from it they said can return today I went to return because it is different to my phone so,I think this branch is the worst branch in London and they rude to customers.I never give to my friends to buy 3phones or anything"
176807,Very easy process. Went smoothly with no complications.
100395,"Extremely misleading, sent me offer for £1 a month for 2 months. But they sign you up for £5 boost without you knowing. Word it all like it’s free in your email. It’s detailed in some t&c really small at the bottom of the email after it looks like the email is finished!! It’s a complete con and I’ll never use them again now. They are awkward and near impossible to chat to anyone. I did eventually, I couldn’t even watch because their app isn’t supported on my LGtv any more!!"
108329,"Recently purchased TV, cabinet, speakers for sons room. Staff friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Products were fantastic, in past had some bad customer service, but seems got much better! Will certainly use again"
145403,Abdullah was 1st class - very good service
193629,"First speed promised was minimum 30 mbps, when was ordering it was from ~45 to ~60. Never seen that top speed 60 mbps(~7.5mb/s) in my life with trashtalk. In fact it wasn't even minimum promised. Was fighting with trashtalk for months to get at least 5mb/s. After 6 month: 3 weeks had disconnects over 20 times in half an hour whole damn day, every day. For 4 weeks i tried to contact them. Sat for 3-4 hours in chat fruitlessly. After 3 weeks when disconnects stopped they cut those 5 mb/s, for which i fought for months to 1.8 mb/s. When I finally got to their support they said it's the speed I'm supposed to have. Can't wait for contract to end, never using trashtalk ever again"
157251,I have brought a AEG washer and dryer which costed me £900+ and it stopped drying after 2 years I have called the engineers out 3 times and all of the they said that we haven’t seen this machine before they have inexperienced people working with them and now they said that we can not make any more visits I recommend not to buy and extra cover on any of the item shi service
112538,Good website. Easy to use. Fast delivery. Good packaging
100974,"First of all i waited ages for my order, then i got told they’re assigning another driver, then they called me to say my order has been marked as delivered when it hasn’t been, i work in a restaurant myself and the amount of times the drivers take the food is ridiculous. think they need to find better employees who won’t eat the food that’s supposed to be delivered to someone else. Now i have to wait for a refund which will take 5-10 days therefore i can’t order anymore food."
164578,"Excellent, quick delivery thank you"
124989,"Purchased it. Received the activation codes. Activated. Process was quick and easy. Saved over $100 buying Melodyne here as to getting it directly from Celemony.

Definitely give this site a look when looking for good deals on some plugins!"
155081,"Happy with the service, quick with the service, and reliable,. Thankyou."
128842,"Possibly THE most impossible people to deal with. I really hope you don't need to contact them with regards to things such as taking random payments from your bank account. I really could not advise against this service strongly enough. Trying to cancel them is yet another hurdle, good luck with that! I dont normally feel this strongly but feel so exhausted they have knocked the fight out of me at every turn. Shame on you Now Tv. Improve your customer service channels and put the customer first that way you might have a chance of competing in the market. Remember people are more likely to tell people how bad a company is when they are receiving bad service."
175060,"We have been supplied batteries by Tanya for a couple of years now. We have found Tanya to be great!

118741,"HOTPOINT HEAT PUMP DRYER, FTCL871GP,
DOMESTIC & GENERAL COMPLAINT,
DG-1991818-2022 aged 70, D&G is the biggest nightmare of my life, & CONTINUING. We are totally disabled people with 24/7 care needs. & all our medical documents have been sent to D&G, Firstly the rear water pump had gone, & was repaired OK.

D&G papers then received, Appliance was now on full cover. However, On another usage it was dead, then 2 weeks later, HP eng came out, & said at least the top PCB is dead, 2 weeks later HP turn up, & change both the top & bottom boards, & the wiring harness, as it had shorted & burned out. 2 hours after we are on tel, it is still not drying clothes, & is stone cold. Another 2 weeks till next appointment.

Under the terms of the Policy docs, ** that D&G first supplied **, it states, eng can write it off, or D&G can write it off, ZOE of replacements put it in for write off exchange. However we are told that was refused ?.

D&G Agents stating, 1) As on the policy, when HP do ANY REPAIR WHAT SO EVER, then Hotpoint are WHOLLY liable for ANY & all repairs & all parts, even if they are totally un-related for 30 days. D&G repeat this, YET IT IS NOT IN ANY POLICY. D&G Ella then turns around & states REPEATEDLY, my contract is Repair & Care, & it does not include replacement.
She says she will send me out the correct insurance documents by post ??, I demanded via email, they arrived whilst I was speaking with complaints, however these are the exact same, & it clearly stated, HP & D&G, right to write off & exchange.

Also, Under the policy it states, we can ask for different repairers, than Hotpoint, again D&G refuse.

I spoke with policy cancellations, & they confirmed,
that MY policy does cover write off & exchange.

D&G then go back to we should sue HP, for botched 1st repair, IT WAS A BROKEN WATER PUMP, D&G say we have to claim under HP liability insurance, Hotpoint says, forget it, their eng did not damage anything, the faults are un related, & its to D&G to pay. We found out that some of D&G directors are also HP directors. D&G refuse to put any of this in writing. We have even quoted a replacement dryer, Hotpoint H3 D81WB UK Tumble Dryer - White, some half the price of ours.
NOT once has a HP eng, spent time with the dryer, its simply replace the part, see the drum turns & leave. In speaking to other repairers, they advise, it will have lost gas in the bottom condenser, & will need replacing this part alone cost over £350.
Heat Pump Base Yate Service Base J00272048,
HP list this part as NOT AVAILABLE.

Last part alone, seems to be MORE than the cost of the new dryer we want, Hotpoint H3 D81WB UK Tumble Dryer - White Note this is NOT a heat pump dryer.

Our added view, is due to the burned out wires & 2 PCB's the dryer is TOTALLY UNSAFE. As disabled people we are unable to run, & its an ON GOING, death trap.

So D&G are NOT ABIDING by the contract, & putting in garbage conditions, additional bits, & exclusion, & THEY WILL NOT PUT IN WRITING. WE WAIT TO GO TO THE OMBUDSMAN. Still no working dryer."
172883,Ordered a b grade gaming headset which is described as good condition. It came without the wireless receiver so didn’t work. It was also filthy from the previous owner and clearly no attempt at cleaning had been made before being sold to me.
194099,"Swift effective with an absolutely accurate description.

Very well packaged and arrived within two working days."
133611,"So speedy and simple, money was in my account the day after I posted the phone!"
194403,"The goods arrived promptly with no hidden charges and were as described. They were excellent value for money. I have used Music Magpie several times now and it has been consistently good, even to the no-quibble arrangements to return an order made in error and issue a prompt refund. This could have been made easier by an effective link on the website but that is a very minor issue. Wholeheartedly recommended."
151127,"Great product, easy & light to use.
Speedy delivery & good communication too."
106571,"Easy selection and ordering online from a great range of batteries at the best prices around. Incredibly well packed for despatch ensuring it's virtually impossible to get damaged. Delivery is very fast, and the battery arrived part charged. This was my third order to Tayna and it certainly won't be my last! Brilliant service. Thanks"
188311,"The service is as smooth as possible - you download a small executable file, it gathers the information about the system, it opens a webpage where it tells you what can you improve. You select what you want, and the order comes in your mail 1-2 days later. Inside there are instructions on how to change your components. It's idiot proof. I wish there were more computer upgrade services like that!"
129370,"I was with BT for a few years then in the Summer I changed to Sky for TV, phone and broadband.
Since then I've been getting endless calls from 0207 numbers telling me either 15-20 people are accessing my broadband, or that there is a fault on the line.
Either way, they always know my full name, email address, home address, mobile number, landline number and are able to send me a 2 factor authorisation code for my BT account.
They try to get me to give them remote access to my device - SCAREY SCAM FOR SOMEONE UNAWARE!
As I say, I don't have a BT account so it's obviously a scam, but the email address they quote I never used for anything other than BT, so I am disgusted that BT seem to have sold this level of my personal information.
I have reported it to BT and they basically just said I did the right thing and never to follow the scammers instructions.
Just been on the BT website and tried to log a complaint which I can only do by logging into my BT Account (which I don't have) or by phoning and queueing - only to probably be fobbed off again."

Chat Transcript
Info: Welcome to Carphone Warehouse Live Chat Service. A representative will be with you shortly.
Info: You are now connected with Clayton. When you have finished chatting with us today, you will be given the option of emailing yourself a copy of this chat.
Info:
Jamie: Why does it cost more to upgrade when I can get a new contract for less?
Clayton: Hey there Jamie. Welcome to Carphone Warehouse, you have come through to Clayton.
Clayton: I'll be more than happy to help you. Firstly the deals are set up by the network providers and not from us.

There are sometimes differences between upgrade and new customer deals. This can be for a number of reasons, such as attracting new customers to a network.

Remember, if you choose to upgrade, you can keep all of your current contract benefits, and you won't have to pay any monthly fees for closing down one contact whilst taking up another. Also by upgrading you get to keep your number automatically.

What you can do to save costs is take out a new plan with me today and PORT your existing number over to the new plan. How does that sound?
Jamie: £43 a month with unlimited everything £99 upfront and £100 cash back which pays the upfront. That's is a better deal than I already have.
Clayton: Yes, it certainly is Jamie, Would you like to go ahead and secure this deal for free delivery?
Jamie: Upgrade to the nearest monthly cost is £45 but only 20gb data and that's £199 upfront with £100 cash back.
Clayton: Which deal are you most happy with to take tonight?
Jamie: I'm looking at upgrading but those prices indicate that the upgrade price isn't worth it.
Clayton: You are more than welcome to choose a new deal as well, nothing is stopping you and you can also take advantage of our 14-day cooling-off period too, to test the phone out.

As we have the 14 days returns policy. So we give you 14 days to play around with the device, take pictures, videos whatever you like. And if you're not happy with it you can have it returned within the 14 days for a refund or an exchange. This is exclusively for online purchases only. Which makes it a great choice to purchase online.
Jamie: Since the initial Vodafone isn't finished for a month and half, they have allowed me to upgrade early but they will had the extra time on to my contract. What is the point of taking advantage of something that works out more expensive? If I take a new deal that means I'm paying two contracts and not upgrading.
Clayton: I completely understand and you can also make use of our trade-in service for extra funds to pay your current contract off so you can have only one contract. What do you say?
Jamie: I say you are not answering the question and you are trying to force a sale. Why is the upgrade price more expensive than taking a new deal?
Clayton: I am sorry you feel that way and I have answered that for you, Jamie. I will repeat it again.


Firstly the deals are set up by the network providers and not from us.

There are sometimes differences between upgrade and new customer deals. This can be for a number of reasons, such as attracting new customers to a network.

Remember, if you choose to upgrade, you can keep all of your current contract benefits, and you won't have to pay any monthly fees for closing down one contact whilst taking up another. Also by upgrading you get to keep your number automatically.

Clayton: I cannot explain that in a more simpler way.
Jamie: Excuse me? ""I cannot explain that in a more simpler way"". Do you normally talk to customers in that manner?
Clayton: I am afraid not Jamie, I am sorry you feel that way.
Jamie: My apologies but I feel I should let my contract run out and go with another company.
Clayton: It is no worries at all, I apologize for the way I made you feel. You are also more than welcome to do so.

I would agree with you on that on waiting for your contract to run out. I am doing the same aswell.
Clayton: Would there be anything else I can help you with?
Jamie: I think you said enough."

158490,"If there was a star rating for extremely very bad then I would have selected it. This company is atrocious they gives the false impression that they have a customer service department, which they don't. I wasted my time trying to contact them over 4 days, via email, via their auto bod (poorly implemented) and live chat sessions and they made it extremely difficult to register a complaint. I regret ever getting involved with this company. I can't even cancel my account. Never again."
174594,"A bunch of jokers....

Hard to know where to start.

Sad for shareholders that these jokers are allowed to run their company but at least they have the power to kick them out.

So contract for bt mobile up for review and i also have bt sport app😭, which is useless as you cannot cast on to big screen.

I have bt broadband, which is fine.

I change packages and am encouraged to switch my mobile contract to EE, a BT company, so now two bills and payments instead of one.

I get a text on my btmobile re new bt sport sub, note bt mobile, and a pop up invites me to report it as spam.

Bloke on the phone disconnected me before end of transaction and didnt ring back and i have had no communication re switch to EE. I wanted wtitten confirnation of no roaming charges before end of new contract so will now have to ring them again

I thought I would updaye following David's response. The arrogant bt assumption that people are on facebook or twitter is stunning. I shun social media and only review when very good or very bad.

Another BT employee who does not understand the BT Sport basic app which they downgraded last year so you cannot cast it.

Anyway, still no confirmation of the terms of my new contract with EE BUT a Sim card from EE arrived in the post this am. So I rang EE quoting the account number but, no you seriously cannot believe this utterly dysfunctional organisation, there is an account number but EE, who the delivery note says sent the Simcard, cannot access the account as it is still with BT. So I have to ring BT yet again.. .."
139775,"I have BT since 2018 and never had any issues, but my nightmare began when I moved to another house in April 2021. First I had to wait 1 month and a half for them to come to install the fibre - they only had an appointment for 1st June 2021. Then the engineer came, completed all the work and the internet never started working. Almost 4 weeks already passed by, I had to call their customer service countless times and they keep giving me deadlines they are not able to meet. They say there's a routing issue, that Openreach is investigating. I have already raised an escalation but didn't have any effect. I don't know what to do more to have my broadband activated and running."
120021,Product arrived on time was kept updated on the delivery and appliance is as described very pleased. I have previously purchased from this company and they are brilliant it's nice to have a company you can trust.
157408,"Do yourself a favour and stay away from this company and their products.
- They are full of extra charges.
- Their coverage is a joke. I live in London and I can never get a decent internet signal anywhere.
- the service in general is awful."
150521,"purchased a fridge/freezer and a washer/dryer from Currys and delivered by team Knowhow. They just delivered it and left without even unpacking it. And guess what both items were badly damaged.After a couple of phone calls, replacements were scheduled for delivery a week later. When they got delivered they were unpacked and i asked if they could take away the packaging from last weeks delivery, which they refused to do, and they were even cheeky enough to leave most of that days packaging in my skip which i didn't see till later. I compiled to customer service an d they are doing nothing. SO CURRYS, YOU HAVE LOST MY FUTURE BUSINESS AND NO RECOMENDATIONS FROM ME."
104610,"Long time customer and this purchase was poor versus their usual high standard. Used product arrived faulty (despite claims of pre checks on all used gear) and should have been spotted easily before dispatch if lens was tested. Not good on a near £1k purchase.

Not impressed with Jack in customer care who played it down as “just return the lens” when I called in. Lacked any emotional input. Poor.

Return and refund handled professionally. No complaints there.

Ended up purchasing the exact same product from a competitor.

Will continue to use Wex as over years I have purchased 4-5 new bodies and countless used items without any issues. Hopefully just a blip."

188209,"Vodafone has one of the vilest, stupidest, most inane communications setup for their customers I have ever encountered. If not for the fact that we were in a rush and had to get internet, I would never go anywhere near them again for ANY form of service.

Customer service is outsourced abroad to poor people who have to deal with customers who will mostly be incensed after being forced to navigate a complex web of passive aggressive automated responses. When you do get through locally (UK), the ones who pick up really do not give a s**t either.

They do other stupid things like send you an email with your account details, ask you to activate the account, but somehow lock you out of it, and then you have to spend 20 minutes calling them to find out that because your service isn't live yet you can't log in. What on earth is the point of that email with my account details then???

I have absolutely no goodwill towards this company left and we've only just begun our contract. I will actively, go out of my way, to tell anyone to avoid Vodafone at all costs so they don't have to experience anything similar to what we have already encountered. I can barely imagine what customer service will be like in the event of any service outage. Good grief!"

I tool this uo immediately with AO and whilst the man I spoke to on customer service was very good in dealing with the issue- he had to escalate it with the damages team, whom I've yet to hear anything from so far...

The strength of the suction feels odd on some carpet where it seems to resist the pile a little but soon got used to this. My only adverse comment is that my previous cleaner was a GTech and I only bought that 5 years ago. I replaced it because the suction wasn't too good any more, which seems like a fairly short life span."
146481,"Nice PC when it finally came, but it was delayed for weeks after PCS ordered to wrong cooler and it didn't fit the CPU (even though I had discussed the specs in some detail before ordering).

Still, this is my 4th PC from them and this is the first time I've had a problem."

Took it back and asked for a replacement. Told there were none in stock - asked for a different model - they said they could only refund ""because it was paid for via PayPal"". Pointed out that the other models in the store were more expensive (including the one we'd handed back - now £50) - they said we had to pay full price. Pointed out that we'd happily pay full price minus the current selling price of the item we'd handed back - they told us ""too late we already refunded you, we don't have to do anything now"". Tried to point out she was wrong and she just walked off."

150757,"In September 2022 I gave vodafone notice that I wanted one of our numbers cancelled as we were having financial difficulties. They charged me £5 for a late payment of this number in October along with £58 for a phone we no longer used. I had to pay them. I then gave them notice that I wanted that number that was no longer being used cancelled. They charged me £5 plus another £58 for a late payment in November for the phone that was no longer being used which I had to pay. I gave them another months notice, and yet again in December they charged me £5 plus another £58 for the same number that was not being used. And again, the same. So, here we are in January 2023 and again I have been charged £5 plus another £58. Every time i call 191 I cannot get past the payment option. I try, but they keep cutting me off. The only option I have is to pay again, or they will discontinue service to the one number I still have. If they disconnect me I can no longer access the service, and this prohibits me working, as I need my phone to work. I am fed up of getting ripped off by Vodafone who have me over a barrel. I have been a customer of theirs for 14 years, not that it counts for anything with them. They are cheating me out of money every month, and as I say, if I dial 191 as they suggest I can never get to speak to a human and cannot get past the payment option, as they only other option to speak to someone results in the call getting disconnected. This is a disgraceful example of exploitation.

See their standard reply below. Again, although I provided them with my number, they put it on my toes to try and get in touch with them !"

147248,"I think Argos has lost the plot. Ordered a TV for delivery to a local sainsburys. Collect from next day it said at Foss island Sainsburys. 4 days later there is still no sign of it. After 2 fruitless exchanges with the live chat guys who were no help. The last one intimating that it's probably gone to the wrong shop and I should go to the sainsburys and ask them about it. But dont worry i'll get my money back if it doesn't turn up. Apparently despatched on the 28th. What?? They have no idea where their stock is by the look of it. It still says collect from next day on this item to Foss Island Sainsburys and indeed one local argos has stock (which they won't let me have). What's going on? And this isn't the only tomfoolery I'm suffering from online purchases from other retailers either at the moment either. Not good enough guys.
Amendment 6th December. Have had no luck with my order at all despite multiple chat contacts and PM messages. Basically they relented and admitted the order had not gone to plan despite earlier assurances it was in transit. They can't seem to cancel it either, waiting for it drop past its collection date so an automated refund is supposedly triggered. I'm not holding my breath though and am bracing for a fight to get my money back. Today's live chat was so contradictory it was laughable.
Another amendment: Well, over a week later past the last day for collection there was still no sign of the order being cancelled and refunded. So cue another live chat that informed me that the order wasn't cancelled properly (tell me something I don't know). After another round of profuse apologising it has now apparently been flagged to the finance dept and I have to wait another 5 working days for a resolution and refund. I would quite happily put money on nothing happening. This is ridiculous now. Argos, you seriously need to look at your processes and practices as after taking payment you have failed on every level afterwards. From the delivery to collection point, to tracking your stick and then to handling a refund after non delivery. All gone wrong. What's going on?
Update:22 days after ordering I finally get a refund. This experience has been unbelievable. Sorry Argos, you used to be good under your old business model. Now it's a bit of a joke"

163572,Stay away from this terrible scammer.I had ordered an I phone 7 from this stupid company in March. It was told that the phone will be delivered with 7-10 days. Money was taken out from my account next day but phone was not delivered until 3rd week of April. As a NHS staff my phone was really important in this COVID-19 Situation. I had to chase them so many times explaining the urgency of the phone as my previous phone was not working properly and my job role involves so many phone calls for the COVID-19 Patients.They replied me once after making few emails and it was reflecting they are so rude and careless just because they knew the money has been transferred to their account. I was not in the position to take refund and order somewhere else as it is time consuming. Finally they sent out a phone which is not tested properly.So many spots on the phone but i accepted as its not brand new phone. But the battery life is so so so terrible.It last only 3 hours after 100% charge. Bluetooth device pairing option is not working. It becomes so hot once i use the phone within very short period of time. I wrote them back letting everything know but answer i got really made me shocked. They are so rude and they do not care at all although they sent the faulty stuff.Now i am not in the position to chase them any more. All i think that i did donate bit of money to this nasty cheat company. I urge all the customers please be careful about this blackmailer before you buy stuffs once they will get your money in their account then they will not care you at all...!!!

189083,The battery in the phone that cost me over £500 went in just over 3 months. Just out of warranty apparently. I paid £80 for a new one. The online help ‘chat’ was hopeless and was just an automated machine. I emailed the support email and there wasn’t a reply. So I had to pay. I believed I had a year warranty on the phone. That’s not true for the battery. Be warned with the warranty. It’s not what you think. I wouldn’t use this company again

Paid for insurance with them over a year. Smashed my phone screen they sent a replacement phone which didn't work I was unable to make calls because of broken speaker.

I ended up getting a gift card to the value of my phone at its current sale price, even though it was on a 40 pound a month contract, with no compensation or apology to make up for the fact I had no phone for a month. Staff were always rude at the call center and lied about the situation. Aviod this company at all costs. Put me off carphone warehouse and this insurance for life."

At the time of the switch we were in contact with Pure Planet about an overpayment of £100s. When Shell took over they ignored the whole thing. I have been emailing, phoning and even used Resolver service to sort this, but every new advisor doesn't seem to read any previous correspondence and asks for more readings and more information!! This has taken months now and I have seen no action, I think they just do this to wear people down. I guess the whole company's motto nowadays is “It is what it is.”"
143140,"The service was exceptional
I contacted the company, got a prompt , courteous and helpful reply directing me to the website and the part arrived within 48 hours.
I do admire the policy of being able to slot in a replacement part which was so sensibly priced
I can’t praise the service I received too highly
A customer for life"

No return label given."

Great prices..."
125785,"Extremely disappointing customer service.
Product ( laptop) arrived damaged and CEX seem to have used every stalling tactic available to them to delay authorising a refund.
I have purchased in store before but I strongly advise people to think twice before purchasing online as if this is their after sales care I dread to think what their 2 year technical warranty looks like.
I purchased this at the end of November for my sons Christmas present, we are now less than a week before Christmas and seemingly no further on ..... despite my requests for a refund so I can purchase another one elsewhere. Disappointing to say the least !!
Don't usually write reviews, if I do they are positive but I feel the need to warn people from purchasing from CEX online. Better to go into store (or to a different company altogether in my opinion) .


Update to the feedback below:
Its a long time for an investigation to be completed when the customer should be the priority and any resolution with the courier should be dealt with after the customer in my opinion.
Unfortunately no, I haven't received any response to my latest email...
If all the required photos can be requested at the same time rather than a request for more every week this would have certainly sped up the process ( I would hope) ."

And it turned up all scratched-screen, all sides, even camera glass. that's supposed to be Grade B according to Cex.
I cant recommend Cex for anything that needs to be posted quickly- they dont seem to rush to post it or use more reliable service when everyone knows Royal mail is on strike. And their grading does not fit any common sense."

167756,I have had a similar experience to other reviewers in trying to cancel my NOW tv pass. It is impossible to do on the website and there is only a robot incapable of dealing with issues. I have wasted hours of my life trying to cancel my pass before stopping the payments from my bank. This did not work. They are using my card details to continue taking money from my account. The bank said this is fraud. I have had to change both cards for this account to stop them. They are unscrupulous and should be avoided.

Their internet is an absolute joke, the installation was ridiculous having to have all these wires put in when there was already a phone line put in?

Deals have been fairly cheap and they've given us good deals to extend our contract. There was one month where they double charged us by accident, and they gave us a month of free broadband by way of apology. The mobile app for watching tv shows isn't great but does the job."

She bought her new phone less than a month ago and because of this and the phone being a new model she will have to wait for a phone appointment this coming Friday with a senior advisor. She has already given all information and police report. She uses her phone for work and having to wait until Friday means that she will not get a phone replacement until next week. I rang the complaints department, they were not very helpful and just stated that it could not be changed. To have your phone grabbed out of your hand and be rather shaken and then receive such bad support from Car Phone Warehouse is a disgrace."

Update: point proven how useless they can be is they have responded on here but asked for a reference number in their form which I didn’t realise but they are asking for your account number to look into your review 🤦‍♂️. They need to correct their form"

Probably then they will re-book an engineer (at my cost! as I cannot work!) and hopefully will turn up on the 2nd booking! SHAME ON YOU NOW TV.. disgraceful way to treat a new customer ! I'm beginning to wonder if I have made the right choice giving you my business..
He has just shown up at 3:30 (Kelly Communications) .. I asked him why he didn't honour the 8-1 slot booking and he could have called me and he said 'I don't work like that I'm afraid... so I said what is the point of NOW TV booking an 8-1 slot with me (I have taken time off work) if you just turn up whatever time you like .. he then said if you are going to be rude I'm not coming in, he took his bag from the porch and left!

165575,"just opened my phone bill to find it says this is my first bill since changing the way i pay (do not know what this is about) phone up, first the gent says do not know how this has happened then kept going away to check things out a few times them said i must have pressed the wrong button when paying my last bill on the phone, and my credit card is now on repeat every 3 months to pay my bill, I DO NOT HAVE A CREDIT CARD, then give me the last 4 numbers of the card witch is a debit card, the gent escalated this as i do not want this and go back to paying over the phone as i have done for many years, but told this could not be done.
i then went on to paying my bill and told a direct debit would take the money out tomorrow.
does anybody know what s going on, i think it is about time i leave B T after over 50 years
i got a reply from B T to say send your message on twitter or facebook and it will be actioned if you mention Trustpilot, this was from John.
I the meantime, i got a E.Mail from B. T to say my case had been closed this was just over a hour after i called them to complain with nobody from B T calling me.
So i called again and got through to the Dundee office and spoke to a gent, he put me through to a person called Daniel, who was very rude and arrogant, he said all this was my fault by pressing the wrong button on the phone when i told him i did not do this he was calling me a liar and he could do nothing to help me and i should go to my bank and sort it out, as i do not have a local bank branch beside me is was impossible, this person is a disgrace to any company, when i asked about my case being closed he said yes it was, but i was down for a call today (thursday) still waiting the next day for a call.

130704,This curling iron is so great. Easy to use and curling my hair was easy. The curls stayed for a couple of days. Pretty amazing. GHD is the best. I have the hair straightener and the hairdryer too.
154164,"Made the mistake (I knew it would end in disaster) of signing up for NOW TV on a trial. They then set up multiple accounts so when I cancelled there was still a live account. Unbelievable I know. After much anguish and many calls, they finally cancelled both and refunded me. But this hasn't stopped payments being taken. Now I find I have a recurring payment of £5 from SKY TV on my bank account. SKY TV and NOW TV tell me they cannot find an account for me or remove this recurring payment. Barclays very helpfully tell me they can't remove it but suggest I keep looking in case another £5 is taken. For the rest of my life presumably. If you want to retain your sanity, avoid SKY TV and NOW TV and don't ever give them your bank details."
180074,"Ordered a replacement water container for a De Longhi coffee maker. Item shown as being in stock, on line order placed and it arrived within a few days. Good price , great service"
100546,"Broadband disconnected before we switched ISP. TalkTalk offered to send out an engineer 10 days later, somewhat conveniently, for them, after our switch date. Obviously there was no point in having an engineer round to test a line that is no longer in use, however, TalkTalk now won't pay us the compensation we are due for being disconnected.
I urge anyone and everyone to avoid them at all costs. They are totally untrustworthy and their customer support is horrendous.

Edit:
(i) Despite their disingenuous offer to look into this, they have provided no help whatsoever. I have already been in contact over Twitter and spoke to customer services for 1.5 hours last week where I was told there would be no compensation because we had cancelled the engineer visit. Never mind the fact they were relying on another ISP to send an engineer round and negate the need for a TalkTalk sent engineer.
(ii) They have requested return of ""their"" router threatening a £50 charge if it is not returned. Our contract finished and according to their T&C's section 7.2: ""All such necessary equipment will be owned by us apart from the following equipment which you will own:
(a) any router, mesh networking device, set top box and/or digital voice adapter that we
send you as part of a new service with us"". This is our first router and as per the T&C's we are entitled to keep it. Another reason to avoid, I hate to think how many people they rip off in this manner.

Edit 2:
After many hours wasted, mine and TalkTalk staff, they finally saw fit to compensate me for the time I wasn't connected. There was still some ambiguity regarding the router, but I do not wish to keep it anyway. If there is no further edit anyone reading can assume the compensation was approved."

Female Agent who had an Australian accent eventually answered and put me on hold altogether for another 1 hour and 15 minutes and then hang up.

Called again and spoke to an Male agent called Melo, told him about my frustration about waiting so long over the phone and having to pay an item I have not received, consumed so much time of my only day off for the week. Melo sounded very condescending and unprofessional! Once again, was put on hold as he said he uses the same line to call another department. And guess what? AGAIN HUNG UP!

184195,"27 FEB UPDATE - BT JUST DON'T LISTEN DO THEY? - their 'template' response below just proves BT don't care about their customers at all and can't be bothered to read complaints - they respond on here so as to be seen to be ""reaching out"" to disaffected customers, nothing more.

TO BT: Don't waste my time with any more template meaningless answers. Your customer service is beyond reproach, unprofessional and with no attention to detail, completely ignoring the real problems customers face - you've sent out a bland 'template' response that bears no relevance to the fact that I have been ""BLOCKED"" from claiming by the office junior in Philip Jansen's office.

All complaints to the CEO's office are automatically passed down to junior underlings reading from a crib sheet whose modus operandi seems to be to ""block"" complainants, rendering the ""auto compensation"" scheme entirely null and void.

Customer service at its very very worst - we pay a platinum price for such a tinpot service. BT have got way too big for their boots and lost sight of its residential customer base - they're way too busy sponsoring XYZ to be bothered about the plight of the average customer. And they really expect us to swallow a 9%+ price hike? I see a mass exodus on the horizon...
=================================

ORIGINAL COMPLAINT:

We had at total communications blackout for 4.5 days & were offered no compensation because ""we didn't contact them at the start of the blackout"" (yes, seriously!!!). I was called a liar when I said we had zero way of contacting them (check your records and Downdetector, BT - it's quite elementary, yet no-onhas bothered to check the veracity of my claim.... )

When I tried to explain that contacting BT was impossible due to a telecomms blackout, a stroppy underling in the CEO's office failed to understand or see the logic in this, simply bombarding me with template answers of ""no compensation ...."". I then queried with the CEO the calibre of his staff. The minion then threw a hissy fit at my questioning her intelligence and had me BLOCKED from pursuing my complaint. A flurry of illiterate emails has ensued -the lack of professionalism and inability to even string together coherent responses beggars belief (this does nothing whatsoever for the public perception of this organisation).

Representing the ""face"" of the company, yet not being able to understand the simplest of things and then having a strop at me is beyond belief but makes you realise you are dealing with rank amateurs - the 'fight' therefore appears entirely futile.

Seriously folks, there are cheaper and far better providers out there. BT lack the professionalism we seek and THEY JUST DON'T CARE - it's as simple as that. And if you bother complaining, you're passed down the chain to the office junior who cannot comprehend the most basic of conundrums (i.e. no communication tool = no communication possible - it's not rocket science, now is it dear?)

In short, BT are an unprofessional bunch of self-serving fat-cats. Way too busy lining their coffers to be bothered with loyal customers.

OFCOM said 'off the record' that they are drowning in complaints of this sort about BT ... says it all really doesn't it?"
168176,Delivery guys came at the time stated and were polite and helpful. Very pleased with service given by ao.
145407,"I was given the information I required, over and above the basics. The staff were very helpful."

194809,transaction was easy and smooth
170913,Highly recommended! Very easy to use and very nice way of exploring the brand further!
146563,If you have an issue with your connection customer service is a very long wait. Even when you get to speak to someone what is agreed doesn't happen so you need to make multiple calls to get a resolution. We have been cut off for a month and been without a router for 2 weeks. We changed to Gigaclear and the service is excellent. I appreciate that some people will have no issues with BT as they dont have any breakdowns so donr get the customer service experience although they are getting a rare beast in recent times.

The delivery date advised was the day before the funeral due to Bank Holidays. They arrived on the date they advised.
We were very happy.with the quality of the product. Absolutely great value for money."

131413,"1st time using this company and definitely the last. Got a message saying tye driver was outside (he wasnt) then got another message stating the food had been delivered (it hadn't). Contacted customer service who said the driver had tried to knock but he didn't, I can see the door from where I sit and have a ring door bell! The driver then stated he had left the food with a neighbour but couldn't say who or what number house! The number on the app for the driver didnt work and we have been offered a refund, we will see if that arrives. Absolute disgrace of a company, avoid."
123256,Appalling service. Wish I'd read the reviews first! Never again.
156668,"Often amazed that HMV are still trading as they don't have the best selection or pricing. However, I saw a DAB radio on offer at a ""too good to be true"" price and ordered for my grandson's Christmas. Twelve days later I chased up through Customer Services. 13 days later I received confirmation of despatch. 14 days later I received an email advising it hadn't been despatched at all and had been damaged in the warehouse. They have cancelled the order and are refunding my money within another 5 days. Have put my faith in Amazon for an alternative radio. Usually my issue with HMV is returning inferior vinyl records. From my recent experiences, and I've bought a lot from HMV over many years, I now find them disappointing and unfortunately not to be trusted. UPDATE 20/12/22: Got a standard response from HMV basically blaming Royal Mail for supply failure when my main issue was them telling me the item had been despatched only to say the following day that it had not been despatched at all but damaged in their warehouse. They cancelled the order they accepted but did not fulfil - Nothing to do with Royal Mail, all to do with HMV."

120517,"I had made an agreement 11/1 to pay an outstanding balance for a tablet on my next bill date. 12/2 I ended up speaking to the same rep who seemed to be denying all knowledge of this agreement and repeating pretty much word for word everything they'd said yesterday about Debt Recovery, and making ZERO attempt to reassure me or apologise for their error or the undue stress this has caused me over such a trifling amount.

Edit as of 13/1/22 this has now all been sorted thanks to a brilliant rep on chat- but to be honest it should never have happened."

185852,"Was going to pay to repair my door but upon searching found D&G repair and care policy which states you can get your repair and pay for 12 months...
No! Not the case, set up was easy direct debit they even arranged the engineer.
Engineer came out one week later and advised that I needed a new washer door (thats all just a door) he did advise with it being a Samsung they are quite pricey. At this point i didn't care as it was getting fixed. The engineer advised it would be 12 hrs to get authorisation from D&G then order the door should be back by Friday this would of been nearly two weeks with no machine again happy as it was getting repaired. Thursday came no confirmation of repair so contacted engineer who advised D&G did not authorise the repair and should of been in touch.
Made contact to D&G who tried to advise my machine had been written off therefore policy cancelled. Got back in touch with engineer who advised this wasn't the case. Contact back to D&G who advised this is what they were advised and cancelled my policy which is in the terms If repair can not take place, I advised I only needed a door replacing, no joy. No contact to inform from D&G just left."
192216,I bought an ex display 3080ti but it has been a nightmare start to end. It arrive loose in a box wrapped in a thin layer of bubble wrap. The IO bracket was bent but after a quick power on the card was working so I straightened the bracket as any person would as it was just the tabs that were bent and I was happy with the card for a few days. The a driver update happened. My screen went black and stayed black with the motherboard error code for no VGA. Looking over the card I could see that the warranty sticker was damaged so I have a suspicion the card had been tampered with or altered at some point. I contacted Ebuyer to enquire about a RMA but was told since straightened the bracket they would not help. They won’t even acknowledge the damaged warranty sticker or that they voided MSI’s warranty when they sent it out with what may as well be no packaging. If you’re going to resell a ex display at least keep hold of the proper packaging or how about putting them in a pre built instead. I feel like this ex display unit is a con to resell broken products.
191991,"Avoid dealing CPW.... I traded in a Samsung as part of a new contract and posted my device off less than 24 hours after the envelope was received. No problem there. I was told £225 for my device, £200 plus an extra £25 for the May bank holiday offer.


I waited 3 weeks and called twice to chase and still no Payment. 1st call, escalated this to the warehouse as my device had not been received. 2nd call I was told they had my device and could see that the warehouse had not responded so they would escalate to the warehouse again. Each time taking 48 hours to respond. By the time it was 3 weeks I was not at all happy so contracted their complaints dept. I was told there were 2 payments pending. 1 for £200 and 1 for £77.77. This was made up of my initial device offer of £200, the £25 BH offer and £50 for the inconvenience plus interest. I was not pleased but accepted it. The £200 was finally paid 4 weeks after they received my device.

Its now been another 4 weeks and numerous calls to their inept CS team. 1 told me they were raising the payment today and it would be in my bank in 5-10 days. No payment received. The next told me he shouldn't have done that as he wasn't able to authorise payments from his job role. The next one had absolutely no record of my account nor my complaint.. The said they would call me back the following day and didn't.

I called AGAIN this week to be told a manager would be in touch. Manager never called but sent me an email stating as my £200 had been paid my complaint was closed???!!!??!

Absolute crap company to deal with, promise payments in order to get you to buy a phone through them and once they have your money/device they don't give a monkeys. Every time I called I was fobbed off with . 'ITS BEEN ESCALATED, PLEASE WAIT THE 24-48 HOURS' Then 'THERE STILL ISN'T A RESPONSE i'LL ESCALATE IT AGAIN'.

Complete fraud, rubbish service and terrible response to any complaint."

Excellent service, quick delivery despite the global component shortage, very competitive prices and the ability to change / update components after the initial order was great. Lots of emails keeping the customer up to date during the process helps greatly, product was sent next day delivery after testing, was well packaged with clear instructions.

This is my first review ever but they shouldn’t get away with it!
New customer- moved into a new flat today WiFi couldn’t be booked till 16th (not great but normal time frame) called up to see if any change could be brought earlier and turns out they put my wrong address in (their fault) and had to cancel and next available one wasn’t till 29th Dec!!! I explained firstly am a key worker which I am (didn’t care) I have a son with learning disabilities and needed WiFi for homework, schooling, play and downtime (didn’t care) didn’t show any empathy in my situation (I was crying on the phone!!) I was speaking to a manager - didn’t even say sorry for their mistake and would do nothing to help me or even apologise for the mistake. Even if I wasn’t a key worker or any of my other reasons should make no difference.
Cancelled (which they didn’t care) and gone with another company and getting it this week. What a load of crap!! I could go into more details but all you need to do is trust me worth company ever!!"

165443,"Worst repair company with a big name, I am getting a pair of headphones repaired which are faulty again after they was sent off for repair to team knowhow, these headphones where brought in on the 07/09/20 and was due for return on the 15/09/20, i received a text on the 14/09/20 stating they have arrived so I went to collect them, they was not there, the customer service assisant basically said they might come tomorrow wait for a call. that was literally all the help I got. she didn't make a call to enquire or do any work to help provide any actual information she just sent me away, so my time and money was wasted. upon trying to call to enquire as the tracking code on the text didn't work (which is 5p minute I may add) you will find every option on the call service for repairs will lock you off once you get to the end so it is literally there to drink your money while you think your waiting for help. as of today 19/09/20 I have received no help and have even tweeted them to try to get some actual assistance which they asked for a ref number which turns out the one they provided in the text doesn't work for me or them. currently I'm in a position where they have my product indefinitely with no date or information on when they will be ready...be careful when getting the breakdown cover when the product cost enough to be sent away Usually on a £200+ product, it may be better to use a different company for repairs then teamknow how."

I've had my money's worth from KnowHow, and the last time they couldn't find a part for my laptop, so I got a new one! I can see from the other reviews that people seem to have had negative experiences, but we haven't so far, so we'll carry on using them. The only gripe is that you can't combine your plans into just one, so you end up paying too much for insurance, really."

I was told by Carphone Warehouse that there was no need for me to contact EE to cancel as they would sort all that out & was advised I would have one more EE bill to pay which would go out in January which is fair enough..Yet EE have just taken another bill yesterday so i've been on to them and they said Carphone Warehouse have never informed them I have left.

106447,"The customer service of this company is the worst I have ever encountered. Firstly, they have a predominately inefficient WhatsApp chat, you sent a message and you may take weeks to receive a response. Secondly, whatever happens to your item, voucher, or gift card, they will find a way to say to the customer always “NO!”. After several attempts to receive assistance, they made me lose my gift voucher kindly given by a friend as a present just because they took weeks to respond, and when they did, of course, the voucher had expired! On top of this, I have been using the Ghd straightener for so long and I can tell that the quality has gone way too low compared to many years ago. This is probably the reason why they had to use Chiara Ferragni as a new sponsor for unplugged, otherwise no more chance to go far!"

PC Specialist upgrade one item at their expense and we chose to upgrade another due to the global shortage. Once the build was initiated it was completed very quickly and following testing the delivery was efficiently managed. We have been very happy with the PC delivered, communication was very good. They only reason this review was not 5 stars is the overall length of time from Order to Delivery being greater than expected, however this has been accepted given the problems with component availablility.

Parcel went missing with courier, so on 25th november i complained, that i hadn't recieved it,on 27th i was told it had been sent to the relevent department for investigation! suddenly on 28th i get notification that my parcel had been delivered, not in the safe place i have registered but in my recycling bins right by my front wall.
By the time i got home the parcel wasnt there!
I emailed and explained, and was told it had been delivered and to check with neighbours. After several emails i kept being told the same thing that it had been sent to the relevant department for investigation and that it could take up to 30 days, i said that the investigation was for the item missing with the courier, not since it had so called been delivered and was told the info had been updated! I was also asked if i would like them to reorder the items with free delivery, but i would have to pay upfront as i dont have a credit account, i explained that i thought they would replace the missing order, but was told i would get a full refund after the investigation. I have since made contact again, with no response or refund,so im still out of pocket!
Absolutely dreadful customer service and unreliable courier!
Update, somebody did try to call today, but unfortunately, i was at work and unable to answer my phone! I did as asked on the reply to this message and rang back, so much for the friendly advisor being able to help, she told me the same thing as I've been told in every email, that its been escalated to the relevant department and that someone will be in touch, so nothing sorted at all!!"

Today the courier couldn’t get through to me? Even though I was in! They said they tried and tried. So they left the food outside. Who on earth leaves food outside. And to make things worse Deliveroo refuse to refund me for food I didn’t get. Sadly i dont have the funds for this. So am leaving this to warn people of this shocking and unacceptable behaviour Shame on you! Courier 1928 PS this is not a dis on WingStop. They’re Excellent .just dont use Deliveroo!!!!!!!!

They repaired just a few weeks ago yet again however my router has reset itself each day since then resulting in diminishing download speeds. The speed has dropped by more than 15 Mbps to the router with lower download speed to laptop, which is almost useless.BT seem unable to make a permanent fix to these problems, contact to CEO etc is of no use these requests are ignored.

6month old iphone kept in official apple case with screen protector.

Called to ask why and I was sent blurry photos that looked like they hadn’t even wiped the phone down with a cloth.

Tried to complain and just forwarded to the website.

Don’t be fooled by them offering the best price online once they get your phone the will chip you on the price.

Complete charlatans, wouldn’t recommend and wouldn’t use again."
135190,Fantastic service and good quality goods.
156294,The whole process was so easy. I expected delays due to the postal strikes so the fact I didn't need to wait for a packing bag in the post was ideal and made the whole process speedy and efficient. Thank you Mazuma
168403,Great service in store with lots of choice and helpful staff member. Booking delivery and installation easy and plenty of dates available. Installer was friendly but didn’t run through any of the settings on the new washing machine. As he left he set it running to clean out any left over dye from manufacture checks but hadn’t done the waste pipe up tight enough and it leaked in the cupboard. Luckily I checked before it went everywhere and I tightened it properly myself!

105841,In the end I had to contact sky directly to sort my order out. It was never processed correctly with Carphone Warehouse. Could never get through on the telephone to talk to anyone just kept on hold for over 30minutes only to be disconnected. Emailed the complaints department about the issue in the hope of resolving the problem and continuing with the order. No response from here either for over a week...when the response finally came it was to pass the book not resolve the issue. I won’t be rushing back!

Staff was happy to trade the phone back and go through upgrade process. Unfortunately they were not sure what the rules are. Once I have trade my phone in, they said that I have to pay outstanding balance anyway. They said I will get it back my money as there must me some kind of mistake in the system. Got back there two days later. They apologise and said that there is more people like me in the same situation and there is many complains around. I have end up without phone and without the money I payed £950 in total. I heave never done better business in my life. They are scammers. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid."

136160,"5 stars is for Terry the gentleman that came out. He is an independent and worked with me to accommodate an early start and then asked me for more details so he could complete the job in one visit.

However I used to be able to book weekends when I had a hot point machine. When I booked online there was no availability. I booked a Friday and then called the number. I went through to hoover and a very rude lady commented that they never have done weekends. If I had known this I may not have chosen D and G for continued insurance"
148423,Absolutely awful service. Left us without a washing machine or a response two weeks before Christmas with a young child and myself being 7 months pregnant - constantly had to call them to try and get it resolved even though I was told twice my call had been escalated. Nobody at this company seems to take notes or have the power to do anything.

It worked perfectly though. I returned in a store and received full refund in a day. I still would recommend CeX. It’s better to buy in store though so you can check phone appearance."

Gladly, this was not the case as the brilliant Sharon from the BT social media team took full ownership of our issues from minute one. Sharon kept us updated at every stage, called when promised, and would DM on Twitter to check if it was convenient to take a call, outstanding levels of customer service, and complaint resolution. . Sharon is an absolute diamond and asset to your business.

191023,I’ve been a customer at Three for a long time and I have been noticing my data being terrible and that they have been raising the prices without notifying me. I then found other data companies willing to charge the same amount for more data. So I called them to cancel my data plan and I was then referred to 4 different people before the last person just cut the phone off before I could cancel. Very disappointed with Three I wouldn’t recommend joining them.

His attitude was shocking, rude, wouldn’t give his name, blatant not want to deal with the problem by feigning he didn’t understand the query, which was the tv wasn’t mendable and we should of received a new tv of the same standard, the one which was delivered was not boxed, dirty, dusty, had scratches to the tv legs and more importantly did not have a Skype camera and the app on it."

They took an order and were unable to fulfil it. When I cancelled they said it would take 5 weeks to refund my money.
They would not acknowledge a complaint.

151483,"Absolutely terrible experience from start to finish, never engage with this company. After getting my phone contract I was unable to use any data or make calls because the service was so poor even in the middle of a city, I never got beyond 1 bar of service. I called to cancel because I wasn’t prepared to spend £50 per month on a phone that works 10% of the time. I was told I had to go into the store to cancel. I went to the store they said I had to call. I called again 4 times and was blatantly lied to as each caller told me I was unable to cancel by call. I was only 7 days into my ‘cooling off period’ of the contract so was entitled to terminate it. After getting very frustrated on the phone I was sent though to the complaints team who told me I needed to pay £900 to terminate the contract early which is an absolute joke. I refused, he then came back with £450 I said no. I was finally able to cancel without charge and receive a full refund after a very long and tiring phone call. These people are glorified scammers and they will take advantage of you if you let them."

Baring I’m mine I was contacting them 5 weeks before. They’ve LIED saying sent me emails (definitely haven’t. I’ve been ringing trying to make contact since 2nd November 2022) now it’s out of warranty they finally reply saying can’t help. How convenient is that!!!

147114,"This is the third machine PCS have made for me - is that enough of an endorsement? This time round, though the other two occasions were definite five-star experiences, I nearly lopped a star, because I was initially advised that running my old Win7 HDD as an alternative boot drive should be ""no problem."" Not so. To be fair, after delivery, and this unwelcome discovery, one of the advisors I spoke to (I must have bent the ear of three or four by then) did his best for me and gave me great (free) advice and spent a lot of time listening to my non-technical rant and his advice all seems to have come good. My old software DOES seem to work on Win10. I was mistakenly believing it wouldn't, (thanks Google) before I'd tried. As such, I owe ""Steve"" a huge debt of gratitude and PCS made it to five stars, again."
134922,Easy to purchase & fast delivery. Sadly when the go cart arrived it wasn’t in a plain box & had pictures of go carts all over the box so my grandson who I was looking after on the day of delivery now knows he’s getting a go cart for Christmas!!!! I understand trying to save the environment from wasteful packaging but maybe there could be a box to tick if you want plain packaging …aren’t most purchases gifts at this time of year. I hope not too many people have had their Christmas surprises ruined!!
135494,Good experience very helpful at all times. Genuinely great products - recommended.
142614,The order was completed on time in full
166520,"Amazing delivery time, less than 24hrs during the run up to Christmas. Item well packed with clear instructions, I don't even have to register the product because I bought it direct from the company.
It's heavier than I expected, the parts that can be removed require strong hand's - which I don't have so I have to wrestle with it. Good suction, but almost wish I got a Henry instead as I have to use the hand held after after I have used the upright, so it's like going round the house twice instead of once."
104295,"Product arrived next day as promised, even though I only just made the cut off time.
Mihai the delivery driver found my delivery address even though it is about half a mile from where the postcode takes you.
All in all a good first time experience using FFX"
102986,Terrible service. Broadband goes down and their response is to ignore you. Try to cancel and the block you by not answering their cancellation number.
177339,"Overall the service was good. I would have preferred a quicker delivery but that was not really a problem.
One of the items was incorrectly packaged and ultimately the wrong item. They only give you 3 days to register receipt of damaged goods which is fine if you are going to install them immediately. I haven't contacted them about the incorrect item, so they may replace it but the repair was affected by the other items ordered.
3 stars for the, slow delivery, wrong item and only 3-days to assess for damage."
103717,"Literally no customer service what so ever.

I want to cancel a rental order I accidentally made like 30 minutes ago and when I email customer service to cancel, they email back twice saying it's already been dispatched! LIKE HOW? My account says the order is proceeding and their own website says I can cancel before dispatch. I bet it is a scam to get more money from us."
146408,"Cupboard 1 was really nice very happy.
Cupboard 2 came damaged. Very difficult to find customer service details. Also delivery company used was terrible. Took over a month to get order."

178298,"Consistently good support and readiness to go the extra mile.

More product specifications would be helpful"
145185,"Dont trust them, they will steal your money.
Well the reviews fit their service, they didn't deliver our order last night, and they refused to refund! Really terrible service and £20+ down the drain!"
175666,"Omg such a horrible company!!!!!
I ordered my new iphone xs yesterday, it arrived today which is great but when i opened it i realised i ordered 64GB instead 254GB. So i thought i can just exchange it and pay the difference. I called online customer service and was advised i can either do it online where i need to send my phone back and wait for new one or i can just go to store and do it there and get new phone straight away. So i choose option 2 and went to branch in Tooting Broadway. I spend there 1.5 hours and even after that time they didnt know how to do it as it was online order. I got so angry and just left. When i got home i phone online customer service once again and was advised by Sia that she doesnt understand why this happend , that they should have just done it. She reassured me that if i go to any other store they will just exchange it for me. So i thought ok i will give you one more chance and went to Brixton branch which i far away from me( i knew they have phone i want in stock) to find out they CAN NOT exchange online order in store!!!! I was so frustrated!!!! Everyone you speak with tells you something different. I am going to cancel this order as they cant handle such basic thing as exchage. Seriously avoid this company!!! They dont respect their customers at all!!!!"
124517,"This is another review regarding the poor and worsening service provided by BT.
The cost of High Speed (joke) Broadband and landline, plus £5/month mobile deal, is now more than £90/month. Ever since I starting using the internet, initially on 'dial-up' and then through a series of broadband deals with ever increasing cost, the service has been adequate to poor. In the many years I've been using it, it has never been acceptable, never mind good.
Now I get continual dropouts - probably 10-20 a day - where I suddenly can't download new pages and usually, I can't reconnect for a couple of minutes, which is extremely annoying.
The issue is that BT fitted substandard cabling in the 1960's and this has resulted in a poor signal since then.
I pay a lot of money to BT and I expect an adequate service.
I have contacted them on numerous occasions when the service becomes unusably bad, and the last polite letter sent to them after they changed our landline to a hub based system thereby making our 4 expensive handsets useless (they sent 2 radio phones after I told them, but they are not that good), was not even replied to.
Looking at the woefully poor ratings, I am one of many who hate BT; they just don't care!"
178644,"Been trying for days to report a line fault.When I finally got through to someone in India after going through all the security questions I was put on hold 3 times then cut off ,I didn't choose this company I was with the post office"

152816,"Recently my son drop the my laptop to the bath(he is suffering from constipation).He take laptop with him to toilet to prepare for school, and unfortunately when he was pressing buttons laptop slides and breaks.He was very upset and he said he don’t want anything for Xmas but I could buy new laptop for my self. I told him to don’t worry because laptop is covered by “Whatever happens cover “-it was pure accident.But guys from claim department said they will don’t classify that like accident. I pay for my cover all most £1000 over 10 years,when I will know that how will happen I will put dose money to piggy bank and buy at least 2more new laptop.Have think twice before you take cover from this company.Very disappointing."
123351,"Excellent hoover , sometimes this model is a job to get into corners"
125519,"Very clear and easy to use website with great product information. Ordered, had it delivered on the day I requested with updates every step of the way. Very happy and would highly recommend!"
191988,"TERRIBLE AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
This is the second time Open Reach has cut off he service mid contract with all bills fully paid. The way we found out today was an email asking for £269 for leaving the contract early!!!!!!!!!!!!! They said they would switch us back on again in 10 days time and then........another email ....ooooooh we don't think we can make that date. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES GO NEAR THEM they cut us off at the start and we thought once we had got going it would be OK - no hope unfortuantley"
195765,"Depsite 2 confirmation text messages they didn't show for delivery. When I chased, their support team said they would contact the depot. When I called again later there were no notes on my account and it looks like I was never booked in for a delivery in the first place."
153311,"Good communication

delivered on time. Hasstle free"
189074,"Below minimum speed guarantee after the switch by a huge margin. Now I’ve passed my 30 day guaranteed period and will be leaving. At this point it’s dropping internet completely every half an hour and a router reset is required to fix it, honestly beyond a joke. Switching to FTTH, these guys can ram it."
137919,"Everything I ordered, prints and ornaments, were great quality and arrived in time. Great company and great service!"
188707,"I ordered a PC with 1tb SSD and was given a 500gb SSD, when I contacted them at first I was offered a same day full swap which was to me the right option but then I was put through to someone else and was told that wasn’t a option and the two options would be I remove the SSD my self then they would have send out the new one and swap at the door which I considered till they said windows 11 wouldn’t be installed on the SSD and I’m not a tech guy so don’t really know how to remove the SSD or install windows 11.

The whole buying experience has been awful and so has the customer service I have paid for something I didn’t receive I have now given up after 1month of emails back a fourth not getting any where with them I will now have to buy my self a SSD cause this company is ridiculous and they are at fault.

UPDATE: so they have got in contact again and offered me the same options as last time and they had also flagged this review as a none genuine experience so i have now had to take screen shots with proof of purchase and send them to trustpilot to keep this review up as this is a genuine review of my horrible experience with this company."
167699,Great customer service team and resolved my issue straight away
166545,"CHARGED FOR FREE TRIAL!!! Took £25 from day one, many many customers reporting this scam. Reporting them to Trading Standards. Extremely difficult to contact them. AVOID!!!!"

106629,They look great! Brilliant quality and completely accurate. My daughter was so pleased with her birthday invitations - thank you!
120835,"The true merit of any company is how they deal with issues when things go wrong and judging by others recent feedback, I'm not alone in saying they are playing a dangerous game of overcharging us and their staff telling lies when questioned about this and also about the processing time for a refund.

In my case, they took £400 more than they should have and it has yet to be refunded despite the customer rep saying it will take five working days (Tues, Weds, Thurs, Fri, Mon - today; that's five working days), it's overdue now and they will no doubt make up some other lie to keep hold of money that isn't theirs.

I've taken it up with my bank as I can't trust anything CPW will tell me anymore."
107954,"Absolutely terrible. I called yesterday to get a new line connected and was told I would get an appointment in up to 12 days.
I got another message the day later saying the order was not able to be completed. I wasted another 30mins on the phone to a rude and condescending woman who blamed openreach.
When I said to her I was unhappy with how she spoke to me and that I would like to speak to a manager she left me on hold and didn't transfer me.I
Poor listening skills!"
137729,"Bought a Neff microwave on Saturday morning & it was delivered the following day. Easy to navigate & informative website, great service, super fast delivery (even on a Sunday) kept up to date with order throughout, can’t fault the service, will definitely use again."
159827,"Having bought batteries before from Tayna, why would I go anywhere else!!.
Always great prices and easy selection of the best output for my particular application.
Ordered a Yuasa YBX5335 for my 2008 Citroen C Crosser 2.2D HDI, fitted like a glove and all working perfectly.
Only niggle was that it was ordered on the 15th, arrived at the delivery depot at 06:28 on the 16th and did not arrive till 13:20 on the 17th, but suppose its really busy at this time of year as its near Christmas etc.
Mind you I am still very happy with service from Tayna."
108580,the set up is good you can come and go with no obligation the down side is the picture quality when watching football it hurts your eyes trying to watch the slow frame rate i wont be purchasing Sky Sports pass again until they up the frame rate
165170,Prompt delivery and items correct and good quality.
119226,"I liked the way my item for repair was picked up and sent to repairer
I liked that I was told it would be reoaired.
I did not like the the lack of updates on progress
I did not like the fact that when the item was sent to manufacturer for repair that i recieved the notice that my item had been sent and recieved was very confusing as nothing came to me explaining what was going on."
110892,"A great website for Custom PC's. This is the second PC I have had from them and never been disappointed.
They were great in giving me a couple of recommendations that would improve my PC, which I accepted and it was well worth doing.
The PC came very well packaged and i would recommend them and i would get my next PC in the future from them too."
126267,A good service and product its nice you can get spares
145523,Every item as described and delivered on time.
181415,"Their poundland router is atrocious. Speeds were apparently 'improved' to 135mb. That lasted about 3 days, now I am down below 20mb at times, even though nothing has changed on my end since I recorded a speed of 135mb (same device, same room, same router location, same usage, etc etc). I work from home, and I'm constantly getting kicked from Zoom calls to the point where I can't join meetings. In the evenings I can't even play a YouTube video without it buffering or freezing. The amount of times I've had to restart or completely reset the router (and set up the networks again) for seemingly no reason is completely unreasonable for a modern broadband provider making billions. There doesn't seem to be any guarantee of speeds unless you're on their most expensive plans, so we are stuck with a speed *less than 15%* of what we're paying for. I am filled with regret for not switching to Community Fibre before the change period ran out. I will give them 1 star for a few of the staff I've talked to on the phone - they do have some good people there."
116619,"Vaishali is the name - what a brilliant hardworking lady - wonderful. She managed to fully understand to detail
my case and with that Customer Care in mind , she managed to do it for me and my family-God bless her. Shell Energy needs more people like her .

Well done Vaishali. You are a star to your customers and good representative for Shell. Please keep working hard and that level of expertise- brilliant lady. Well done ."
119165,Product quality was excellent and it was delivered on time. I’m very happy with my purchase.
189549,"On purchasing iPhone 14s myself and my partner both traded in our iPhone 12 Pro’s, at the same time but in separate orders. Both were in pristine condition, having been screen protected and covered from the moment they were taken out of the box less than 2 years ago. We both received emails reducing our offers from £425 to £360. Clearly Mazuma have reduced the price after the new iPhone has been released and they’re now trying to scam us out of our money.

Avoid!"
192134,Kay is so patient and helpful . She was so amazing!!!! Thank you for solving our problem completely !!
175894,"The overall experience was great, the team where amazing in customer service only had one problem that was dealt with professionally and that
Was a cooling system"
111057,"Been with TalkTalk for years and they’ve been fine but not sure what’s happened recently but they’ve become easily the worst broadband provider on the market.
All broadband companies use OpenReach infrastructure so the speeds you get will be broadly similar with any provider so that’s not so much of an issue.
The issue with TalkTalk is their customer service. Never experienced anything like it.
Tried to upgrade our contract. There has been twice now where they said they would send an engineer out and when it comes to the day, they don’t show up. Apparently it gets cancelled on their end but no one tells you.
Each time it happens you need to spend more than 3 hours on hold and you get passed between up to 15 different people.
Still not resolved our issue.
We now have to pay more than we ever agreed to because it has taken them so long that our contract has expired and we have to now pay the out of commitment rate.
Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Awful"
167252,"The service was quick and smooth.
Paid quickly."
175308,"Excellent service, excellent phone"
167206,Really great friendly and professional staff as always.

130286,Initially very helpful. After a few months my service now keeps dropping and is very slow. No direct personal assistance or helpline. Will be changing provider at end of service
